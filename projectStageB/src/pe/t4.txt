wanted to tell you how awesome the trip was! We saw so many incredible sights and have unforgettable memories of animals, birds, volcanoes, the Pacific. 
well I could go on and on. 
Our guide knew just where to take us and because the group was so small, we ate in local places where he knew everyone . 
we experienced the country in a remarkable way. 
He (tour guide) is amazing. Brilliant and an excellent guide and teacher. 
To all of you who planned the trip so meticulously, it was perfect. Thank you so much,
