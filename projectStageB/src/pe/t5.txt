Our tour leader did a fine job of organizing the tour each day. 
He knew the area so we got to where we were going very efficiently. 
He seemed to feel very comfortable in Mexico. Guides were fine. 
The route was very well thought out and suited me because I liked all things Mayan. 
I also enjoyed seeing cities and other features not related to the Mayan . 
I liked visiting the family at San Cristobal because I wanted a look behind the scenes. Lodgings were fine, it was an interesting variety. 
Transport was nice, roomy and comfy .
good driver and an interesting person. 
Meals were interesting, I enjoyed the variety that I was exposed to.
