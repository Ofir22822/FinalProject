This was truly a wonderful stay.
I have been working on Covid19 centric studies and I really needed a getaway.
The staff were amazing and very professional.
Chrome casting to the tv was a breeze.
Warning for those who prefer a bathroom far from the bed..
the bathroom is small but it has a wonderful rain shower head that more than made up for the small space.
Iâ€™ll definetly be back.
