Our guide was a lot of fun and very knowledgeable about everything Costa Rican. 
He was always at the service of our group. 
The driver was also very nice and helpful and a terrific driver too. 
The program was excellent and I had lifetime experiences while on the tour. 
Going through the Monteverde Cloud Forest and seeing the male and female Resplendent Quetzal and riding the sky tram the same day was a memory I'll enjoy all my life. 
The route taken and the points of interest we were shown were what I came to Costa Rica for. 
All of the places I stayed were very clean and the staff was excellent. 
This was the best trip I've ever had. 
Everything cooperated including the weather and wildlife. 
I hope to travel with Amerika Venture again soon.
