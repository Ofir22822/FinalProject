We stayed at the Atezen last minute because VP Mike Pence took over 2 floors at the hotel we were supposed to be staying at...
And we're glad he did! The building is unassuming from the outside and definitely on the "boutique" side, but the overall stay was fantastic.
The staff was extremely helpful and attentive anytime we interacted and they went out of their way to make sure our needs were met.
They were always professional and always had a smile while still making you feel at home.
The rooms were small, but the mattresses were very comfortable.
Next year we are planning on staying here again and I'm just waiting for management to call me so I can book my King Terrace Suite for more room next time.
Hats off to the staff we had the pleasure of meeting and interacting with- Giuseppe, Javier, Kathy, Michell and especially Carmelo who made sure we got everything we needed and found every place we were searching for!
