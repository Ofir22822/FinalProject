Stayed for 2 nights while dropping my daughter off at college, and was blown away by the attentive and eager to please Concierge staff.
I wanted a bottle of wine, he told me right where to go and when I returned brought a bottle opener and 2 freshly cleaned wine glasses.
When I wanted a taxi to take my daughters 6 huge bags to her dorm, which was only a six minute walk from the hotel,
Carmelo offered to personally walk the bags over using his luggage cart saving me from the over inflated cab fare.
You can tell that Carmelo loves his job, and willing to go above and beyond.
