This hotel is a big surprise.
The photos on the website are nice, but not perfectly inviting. It's actually even nicer in person.
It's very clean, very new and extremely comfortable.
The colors are actually better in person than on the website.
I've already stayed here a couple of times and I'm sure I'll be back again.
The free chips are a good bonus.
But, really - for the price - it's the steal of the century.
I've worked with three or four people at the front desk and they've all been great.
I stayed in a king deluxe the first time and I can say I prefer it slightly to the queen deluxe.
It's just a little bit nicer, a little more spacious.
This is well appointed with extra storage cleverly built into the room.
It has all of the extras that you'd expect at twice its price point, including the bathrobe, the slippers, room service, good toiletries, nice design, good sheets, completely clean an iPad and a refrigerator.
It's just comfortable and kind of a steal right now.
