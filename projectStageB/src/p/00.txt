Great experience!
Staying in the hotel for the 4th time already. The staff is really friendly, rooms are clean and breakfast is just super-amazing (this is best part of the stay usually).
If you go to the beach or to the park, they give you a “beach-kit”, which includes a towel, bottle of water, snacks and a bag itself.
Highly recommended!
