We were living abroad and planning on moving back into our home in the States and wanted to refresh the rooms.
Decorist was the perfect blend of individualized service without having to meet in person or go to stores to find all items yourself.
Our designer Nora O'Halloran had beautiful design ideas and was prompt to act on any preferences I suggested.
Would highly recommend this service.
