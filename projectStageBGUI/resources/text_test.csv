Together with the surrounding Harz Mountains Nature Park and Geopark it is one of the most popular areas for walking and skiing in northern Germany. With sections in both Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony the park offers a mix of ancient legends and rugged scenery and is a popular tourist destination all year round. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner If youre not afraid of witches you might like to explore the fabled forests and mysterious moors on marked footpaths such as the Goethe Trail or the Harz Witches Trail. Mount Brocken in Saxony-Anhalt is a spectacular sight. Its 1132m summit is often enveloped in mist and has inspired many tales about witches. Steam-powered mountain railway You can of course walk up to the summit of Mount Brocken. But it is much more relaxing to ride the Harz narrow-gauge railway to Germanys highest-altitude train station at the summit. Pure adrenaline But if that is altogether too sedate for you why not try a completely different activity? Guided mountain bike tours take adventure-hungry bikers up and down the mountains on narrow trails steep slopes and stony tracks. See rare animals up close The park is a great place to get close to nature and wildlife. If you have always wanted to see a red deer a black woodpecker or a wildcat you can do so here. You can also watch the lynxes being fed and attend wildlife watching sessions – an absolute must for animal lovers. UNESCO World Heritage The cultural highlights of the region are in the medieval towns of Goslar and Quedlinburg. The Rammelsberg mines the old quarter of Goslar and the Upper Harz water management system and the collegiate church castle and old town of Quedlinburg are UNESCO World Heritage sites. read more » « less Harz National Park Unique features Year-round activities UNESCO World Heritage sites of Goslar and Quedlinburg Activities Walking mountain bike tours relaxation Landscapes Forests fens streams Contact for accessible holidays Ingrid Nörenberg Email noerenberg@nationalpark-harz.de Tel +49 03943 550 212 Travel information Closest ICE train station and closest major city Braunschweig 60km Related topics UNESCO World Heritage Walking Cycling Discover more in the local region Harz Mountains Nature Park and Geopark – wild and rugged scenery » The German Language Route – Language does not just bring people together » www.nationalpark-harz.de/en Copyrights Home Leisure and recreation Natural landscapes National parks Harz National Park top of page Search at germany.travel Save route Share/forward route Print route Delete route Create new route My routes 0 View in Google route planner Unnamed route 0 DestinationsLength of route 0 kmDuration 0 Means of transport The route cannot be calculated.

The chance to get close to nature offered by the numerous plant and animal species here is unrivalled anywhere in western Germany. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The Eifel National Park is located in North Rhine-Westphalia in the northern part of the Eifel region. Not only does it fill the gap that existed in the network of national parks in western Germany until recently it is also the first conservation area to protect upland beech forests on acidic soil that are exposed to an Atlantic climate. Forests that once used to produce timber are now being transformed into wild unspoilt woodland. The park also provides a vital habitat for more than 2170 endangered plant and animal species. Wildcats hunt for mice in the large expanses of forest and beavers build their lodges in the clean water of the streams. Numerous types of bat and the kingfisher also enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the national park as do the yellow narcissi that delight nature lovers with their magnificent floral display in the spring. Visitors can discover a remarkable synthesis of woodland and water and there are plenty of activities and attractions on offer. The national park can be explored independently or by taking a guided tour. Almost daily rangers lead groups through the park and reveal some of natures secrets. The Eifel National Park Centre with its 2000 square metre barrier-free exhibition Wildnisträume Wilderness Dreams invites visitors to marvel and discover at the historic location of Vogelsang. The Eifel National Park Forestry Service organises exclusive group tours lectures and expert tours on request.

It’s easy to wander into high-end restaurants without realizing it and walk away with the idea that dining out in NYC is wallet-busting. And while it is true that New York is home to a lot of $500 set-menu restaurants and restaurants where a nice” simple” dinner with wine can top $100 the city is also home to starving artists working-class folks and underpaid interns trying to make it in the big city — and they can’t afford any of those fancy meals. Heck not many people can. I mean who can drop $100 on dinner all the time? Not me! Not you! Not the majority of these people! Because of that New York City also has a variety of cheap eats happy hours and food deals that make it easy to eat in NYC on a budget. However as a visitor it’s often hard to know where to find those holes-in-the-wall and markets. This is definitely a place where you need to be in the know for a lot of this deals. There are thousands of restaurants in the city. How do you navigate them all? You need someone on the inside. That person is me! So today I am going to share my tips on how you can eat out in NYC on a budget and give you some of the knowledge I’ve accumulated by always eating out in the city Eating in NYC Tip #1 Hit the Oyster Happy Hours During the week you can find countless oyster happy hours which are one of the most popular things to do especially in the summer when you can sit outside. They start around 4pm and go until 6 or 7pm and the oysters range from $1 to $1.50. Arrive early as most restaurants fill up quickly and build up impossible wait times. My favorite and the best oyster happy hours in NYC are Jeffrey’s Grocery 172 Waverly Place West Village +1 646-398-7630 The Dead Rabbit 30 Water St +1 646-422-7906 Good Night Sonny 134 First Ave +1 646-692-3254 Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar 95 First Ave +1 646-791-5400 The Mermaid Inn 96 Second Ave East Village +1 212-674-5870 John Dory Oyster House 1196 Broadway +1 212-792-9000 Grand Central Oyster Bar lower level Grand Central Terminal 89 East 42nd St +1 212-490-6650 Zadie’s Oyster Room 413 East 12th St Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar Chelsea Market 75 Ninth Ave +1 646-568-1223 The Ten Bells 247 Broome St +1 212-228-4450 <liSagaponack Bar & Grill 4 West 22nd St +1 212-229-2226 Greenpoint Fish &- Lobster Co. 114 Nassau Ave Brooklyn +1 718-349-0400 Brazen Fox 106 Third Ave +1 212-353-1063 Littleneck 288 Third Ave +1 718-522-1921 The Jeffrey 311 East 60th St +1 212-355-2337 Atrium DUMBO 15 Main St +1 718-858-1095 Catfish 1433 Bedford Ave Brooklyn +1 347-305-3233 Eating in NYC Tip #2 Bottomless Brunch New York City runs on the bottomless brunch where for around $35 you get unlimited drinks with your food. This is a weekend-only thing and a staple of the city’s social scene. There are countless bottomless brunches so it would be impossible to include them all here but below are some of the most affordable and best value bunches in the city The Flying Cock 497 Third Ave +1 212-689-6900 – Pay $19 for bottomless Bloody Marys mimosas or Bellinis for 90 minutes.

Eating in NYC Tip #3 Grab a Pizza Slice NYC and pizza go together like white on rice. You can’t separate the two and in my opinion the New York slice is probably one of the best pizzas in the country sorry Chicago! If you’re looking to eat on a budget grabbing a slice is one of the best ways to save money in New York. Slices range from $1 to $4 though $2 is the max I’ll pay unless it’s really good. Below is a list of my favorite dollar-slice joints and a couple non-dollar slices just because they are that good Percy’s Pizza 190 Bleecker St Joe’s Pizza 150 East 14th St and other locations 2 Bros 601 Sixth Ave Ivana’s Pizzeria 2373 Arthur Ave Bronx +1 718-365-4322 99 Cents Fresh Pizza 151 East 43rd St 473 Lexington Ave 201 East 34th St B 9th Ave the Best Pizza 748 Ninth Ave NY Fresh Pizza 787 Ninth Ave Joey Pepperoni’s Pizza 381 Broadway 493 Second Ave 114 East Fordham Rd Bronx One Dollar Pizza 578 Ninth Ave +1 212-967-3310 Vinny Vincenz Pizza 231 1st Ave 212-674-0707 Eating in NYC Tip #4 Munch on Dumplings Chinese dumplings are also one of the best value meals in the city because you can get huge plates of dumplings for literally just a few dollars and if you get them frozen for later they are even cheaper. They’ll fill you up for lunch and you’ll still have leftovers for dinner. And thanks to the city’s large Chinese immigrant population the dumplings are incredibly authentic. This is the real deal here. Here’s a list of the best spots to get dumplings in NYC Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle 40 Bowery St +1 646-683-0939 – 9-11 dumplings for $3. Vanessa’s Dumpling House 220 East 14th St Union Square +1 212-529-1328 – 5-10 for just $2 or less. Noodle Q 2 East Broadway +1 212-219-8223 – A big plate for $6.

Eating in NYC Tip #5 Grab a Dog Hot dog shops litter the street corners of New York. They might not be the healthiest meal but they are super cheap and make for a quick lunch. Though the hot dog has been around for centuries the modern dog was popularized by Nathan Handwerker a Jewish immigrant from Poland living in NYC. In 1915 he worked at a hot dog stand at Coney Island. He started his own stand Nathan’s Famous and undercut his former boss to sell his own dogs and the rest is hot dog history. You can get a big juicy dog with lots of fixings for between $2 and $5. Here are the best hot dog shops in New York City Gray’s Papaya 2090 Broadway visit the website for more locations Crif Dogs 113 St Mark’s Pl +1 212-614-2728 Rudy’s 627 9th Ave +1 646-707-0890 – This dive bar gives you a free hot dog when you order a drink. Nathan’s Famous visit the website for locations Feltman’s Kitchen 80 St Mark’s Pl visit the website for other locations Dickson’s Farmstand Meats Chelsea Market +1 212-242-2630 Papaya King 179 East 86th St +1 212-369-0648 Tony Dragon’s Grill Madison Ave & East 62nd St +1 917-299-1550 Paul’s Da Burger Joint 131 2nd Ave +1 212-529-3033 Dominick’s Hot Dog Truck Woodhaven Blvd & 67th Ave Deli & Dogz food truck visit the website for locations Harlem Shake 100 West 124th St Shake Shack visit the website for locations Eating in NYC Tip #6 Food Trucks If you’re looking for cheap eats check out the food trucks around town that are a staple for the office workers. You’ll find shawarma hot dogs gyros halal items and lots more grab-and-go food. They tend to be located near big parks like Central Park or Union Square Midtown or the big squares in the financial district. Their cheap quick eats are what we have for breakfast and lunch though many are around during the evening too. Most meals costs $5-7 USD. Eating in NYC Tip #7 Make Your Own Food Sure New York City has tons of delicious and expensive restaurants but go to the supermarket grab either a premade meal or ingredients to make your own and head to one of the parks and eat outside. Or back to your Airbnb to make your meal. Most supermarkets also have areas where you can eat inside too. My favorite grocery stores in the city are Whole Foods – Whole Foods has affordable natural and organic foods primarily from local vendors. Trader Joe’s – A grocery store chain with super low prices all the time. Food Emporium – Another supermarket chain that also has lots of imported food options. Eating in NYC Tip #8 Try Meal Pal for the extended traveler If you’re looking to be in town for a while two weeks or more consider signing up for the service MealPal. It’s $120 USD for a month $6 a meal which works out to be a super cheap way to eat. Monday through Friday at lunch you get to choose a preset meal from thousands of restaurants. Think of it like a lunch menu at your fingertips. MealPal also has a dinner option and packages as small as 8 meals per month so even if you’re planning a 2 week trip you could make this work any package you choose will make your lunches or dinners only $6-8 each. It’s a good way to try new restaurants as well as eat cheap. Eating in NYC Tip #9 Eat Outside Manhattan I love Manhattan. It’s my favorite borough in the city but whenever I leave it I’m always reminded of how expensive it is. The other boroughs are like half the price of Manhattan. In Queens for example you’ll find a ton of great and cheap ethnic food. Eating in NYC Tip #10 Use the Apps Looking for cheap eats? Crowdsource. Use apps to search for people’s favorite restaurants or what is affordable near you. My suggested apps are Yelp – Yelp lets you find places to eat and drink in your area and there are usually tons of reviews left by patrons. Foursquare – Find out where the locals are eating and unlock special deals when you check into a place. OpenTable – Check local restaurant reviews and then reserve your table. Roaming Hunger – Find out which food trucks are in your area! Eating in NYC Tip #11 Eat Bagels The NYC bagel is as famous as the NYC slice. We take our bagels seriously here Just ask all the ex-NYers living in LA if they can find a good bagel there! They’ll say no and lament that’s one thing they miss the most. Most bagels will cost $3-4 with cream cheese more if you want lox which you should. A bagel sandwich will cost around $5-6.

Its dumplings fried rice and pork buns are delicious. There’s always a wait on the weekends so try to get there on the early side. Bennie’s Thai Café 88 Fulton St Financial District +1 212 587 8930 – As someone who has lived in Thailand I’m quite picky about my Thai but this restaurant is legit. It’s a popular lunch spot with the working crowd and serves incredible curry. It’s one of the few locations where I can get an authentic Thai iced tea too! Service is a little too fast and abrupt but who cares? The food is incredible. Corner Bistro 331 West 4th St West Village +1 212 242 9502 – This place has world-famous thick and greasy hamburgers some of the best in NYC. It’s sort of an institution and if you love burgers as much as I do I would highly recommend coming here. Cash only.

Panna II Garden 93 First Ave 2nd floor East Village +1 212 598 4610 – Christmas lights cover the ceiling and walls of this festive Indian restaurant and the neighboring restaurants too so if Panna II is packed walk next door. It’s cramped but a unique experience. The food is delicious! Cash only. S’MAC 197 First Ave East Village +1 212 358 7917 – A mac-and-cheese shop that takes this traditional dish and makes it even better. It’s heavenly cheesy goodness. The four-cheese mac and cheeseburger mac are my favorites. Sao Mai 203 First Ave East Village +1 212 358 8880 – This traditional Vietnamese spot is located near my old apartment. The pho rocks!

I’m already signed up. Would like a way to opt out so that I can read the article easily. Reply Keith November 8 2018 at 421 am My tip is to buy a sandwich at almost any deli bodega or corner store. They’re typically massive cost around $5 and when cut in half will give you 2 filling servings. Much better than a chain store sandwich. As a tourist in NYC grabbing one is the first order of business before heading out for a day of exploration. Carrying one in your backpack will prevent the need for dining in an expensive lunch joint when you get hungry in the afternoon.

Shall we go somewhere else?” my friends asked. Sure let’s get the bill!” I replied. When our check came I was reminded of something about Sydney I had forgotten its high prices. Even with a currently weak Australian dollar Sydney was more expensive than I remembered. With its 10 AUD sandwiches 10 AUD beers 19 AUD cocktails 30 AUD hostels sometimes up to 40 AUD!!! and outrageous restaurant prices Sydney can burn a hole in your wallet quicker than actual fire. It was going to be an expensive two weeks if I didn’t figure out how to enjoy the best this city had to offer on a budget. Leaving no stone unturned OK probably one or two I found several ways to save big here – while still filling your days and having a lot of fun. While Syndey is never going to be the cheapest destination to travel to in the world there are plenty of ways to save money in Syndey thanks to all the free and cheap things to do there. Between museums markets beaches nature walks and some local deals there are plenty of ways to lower your costs on your next visit! I’ve divided this blog posts into two sections Part 1 Free things to do in Sydney Part 2 Cheap things to do in Sydney Just click on the link above and get to the section you want! Free Things to Do in Sydney 1. Get an Opal card This metro card is free — you just need to load it with money — and worth using for three reasons it offers discounted fare compared to purchasing one-use tickets this varies by distance there’s a maximum fare charge of 15 AUD per day and on Sundays the maximum is 2.50 AUD. That means you can go anywhere on the transportation system – whether by metro ferry or light rail – and you’ll never pay more than 2.50 AUD! It’s an amazing deal. 2. Explore the free museums Australia has a lot of expensive museums but tons of free ones too. Some worth considering are The Mint a small exhibit on how they used to make money The Australia Center for Photography The White Rabbit Gallery beautiful art The Manly Art Museum The Sydney Observatory The Rocks Discovery Museum! 3. The Art Gallery of New South Wales The Art Gallery of NSW is one of my favorite museums in the city. There are so many exquisite landscape paintings portraits and statues in its collection by Australian and European artists and even a few by Monet. It’s a really substantial collection. Some of my favorites were Albert Hanson’s Pacific Beaches” Guerard’s Jebel Cherib” and Milford Sound” Peter Paul Rubens’ Self-Portrait” and Batten’s Snowdrop and the Seven Little Men.” 4. The Museum of Contemporary Art The contemporary art museum also is free and features Australian artists including many Aboriginals. While I’m not a huge fan of this type of art bottles on the floor is NOT art the Aboriginal collection was breathtaking. You can really feel the artists’ connections to their land and culture as well as the pain of past attempts to take it away from them. 5. Visit the beaches Sydney is a city famous for its free beaches and there’s no better way to spend one of the city’s many sunny days than by enjoying one of them. Try to avoid going on the weekends when they fill up and you have to fight for space. While Bondi is the most famous be sure to check out some of these other great beaches Manly Watson’s Bay Coogee Bronte my favorite 6. Take a nature walk There are a number of stunning public coastal walks that allow you to take in the breathtaking natural beauty of Sydney’s harbor and coastal cliffs. While tons of people do the two-hour Coogee-to-Bondi walk avoid it on the weekends I found Watson’s Bay and the Split-to-Manly walks quieter more relaxing and beautiful. Some other walks worth checking out are Rose Bay to Watson’s Bay Watson’s Bay to Dover Heights Chowder Bay to Balmoral Beach Jibbon Beach Loop Track 7. Free walking tours One of the best ways to explore a new city is by taking a free walking tour. These will introduce you to all the major sites and give you a solid introduction to the city’s history and culture. Best of all these tours are free just make sure to tip!. Two suggested companies for walking tours in Sydney are I’m Free Walking Tours Daily tours of the city center and The Rocks Sydney’s original settlement. Sydney Greeters This is a free service that connects you with locals who will show you their neighborhood advanced booking required. Cheap Things to Do in Sydney 8. Take the Town Hall tour Built in 1889 Sydney’s beautiful town hall is a picturesque Victorian building. On Tuesday mornings there’s a detailed two-hour tour that you can take for only 5 AUD. It’s a great way to learn some extra history about the building as well as the city. 9. Visit the markets Sydney has a ton of amazing markets to walk through. No matter what you’re looking for from antiques to food to local crafts you’ll likely be able to find it at a market. I love the Paddington Market and the farmers market the best. They draw an eclectic crowd and the farmers market makes me want to cook nonstop. Here are some other great markets worth checking out Glebe Market Rozelle Collectors Market Orange Grove Organic Market Bondi Farmer’s Market Manly Market Place Chinatown Night Market 10. Attend one of Sydney’s many events Since Sydney has a complex about Melbourne being called the culture capital of Australia it tries to outdo its rival by hosting over dozens of events each year. It has art gallery nights concerts festivals and much more. Most of them are free and can be found on the Sydney tourism website. Some of the more noteworthy events are New Year’s Eve Sydney is one of the biggest New Year’s Eve destinations in the world Lost Paradise a 3-day music festival City2Surf an annual race and fun run Vivid Sydney an annual light music and idea festival Twilight at Taronga summer music series 11. Eat cheap! Need a cheap meal? The sushi trains around the city offer a filling meal for 10-20 AUD the noodle and dumpling shops in Chinatown offer tasty and authentic meals for less than 10 AUD and Lentil as Anything a vegetarian restaurant in Newtown offers meals on a pay as you feel” system. Another cheap place to eat is the food court in the MLC Centre a big office building in the heart of the business district and popular with office workers. From Mexican to sushi to salads to sandwiches you can find big-portion meals for 10 AUD or less. For more cheap eats check out El Jannah chicken sandwiches Chinese Noodle Restaurant homemade noodles Spicy Joint spicy Chinese food Spice I Am Thai food Wish Bone fried chicken and poutine 12. Avoid the expensive stuff In many parts of the world the high end offers some value and you can walk away from an expensive meal and say that was worth every penny!” However that’s not often the case in Sydney. I was always disappointed. From cocktail bars to upscale steak and sushi dinners I always left hungry unhappy and thinking about the lack of value I got. Stick to beer wine and the low-end restaurants when you’re in town. You’ll get more bang for your buck! 13. Visit backpacker bars for cheap drinks Drinking in Sydney is expensive – with beers costing up to 10 AUD each – but the backpacker bars are where to go for a cheap pint. World Bar and Ivy Hotel have backpacker specials for 4-7 AUD and the Peter Pan Travel Agency in Kings Cross has free drinks on Tuesdays! ***Sydney is a vibrant laid-back beach city with an incredible array of activities. If you don’t watch out it will bust your budget really fast! Sydney may not be one of the cheapest cities in the world but there are plenty of free and cheap events to keep you busy during your visit.

I was in Sydney staying at a friend’s house so that helped to save big on accommodation. But I can’t believe he didn’t suggest I get the Opal Card! 🙂 And so are the Museum and the Art Gallery free? We haven’t checked any during my stay but I’m sure I’ll hit Sydney again in future. Reply Anca April 7 2016 at 1119 am Wow I didn’t know those prices are that high. Even though there are tons of free stuff paying 10$ for a beer hurts 🙂 Sydey you won’t see me yet. Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 958 am I’d been in Australia for about three days went for a beer for my 20th Birthday and paid $14 for a Heineken. I nearly had a heart attack haha. Reply J April 7 2016 at 103 pm I have a soft spot for Sydney after living there for a year. It’s definitely expensive though I’ve done most things on the list. There are some amazing hikes that are parts of major routes even 45 minutes out in the Hornsby/Mount Colah area. Reply Shandos April 7 2016 at 639 pm I’m from Sydney and am used to Americans saying how expensive it is so was surprised that when I recently visited Hawaii it was more expensive than I expected. Sure there were some cheap cocktails but most food truck and cheap” road side stop meals fish tacos coconut shrimp burgers were about $14 USD about $20 AUD once converted and that’s if a tip wasn’t expected more expensive than in Sydney. Is it just Hawaii? Would love to do a road trip around the US in the next few years and hoping food elsewhere is cheaper! Reply J April 7 2016 at 1116 pm Hawaii is definitely considered to be more expensive than the mainland. As budget family travelers I didn’t actually find it to be too bad the 2 times we’ve gone. However we don’t go out much. Bars restaurants Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 1004 am For America it’s just about being patient and searching out a bargain. You’re a captive audience in Hawaii you can’t really escape it and it thrives on tourism. But if you were in say San Francisco even thought it’s an expensive place to live and work you can turn a corner and find a really cheap taco or BBQ place where you can spend $6-8 on a full meal. Reply Angeli Gette April 7 2016 at 726 pm I am glad you got to visit Sydney my hometown it is definitely expensive but it is a great place to live and work. Wages are higher as well so it is relative to the earnings and there are always cheaper options. You’re definitely right – higher price does not mean that it is going to be great. I’ve been disappointed many times with over-priced meals which were crap. I’d rather just a regular meal instead of the fancy stuff. I love Sydney but my husband and I are heading off to be digital nomads on Tuesday. First stop – bangkok. Thanks for the great content Matt. Reply Nicole April 7 2016 at 813 pm As a Sydney sider it’s quite funny to read this.I would normally think $10 is a bargain lunch haha but yes it is quite expensive now that I think of it. Some other free things that are worth doing is visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens or Centennial Park. Fun for a picnic/bike ride/walk. Good way to waste some hours and feed some ducks. Reply J April 7 2016 at 1122 pm Going to Sydney for the first time this year. It’s going to be a long flight. I’m going to the symphony at the opera house and I didn’t think tickets were very expensive. Free stuff will definitely also be on the agenda too. Reply Victoria April 8 2016 at 308 am Thanks for the tips Matt! I haven’t been to Australia yet but will keep it all in mind. I think the prices are reasonable for a nation such as Australia but of course if one goes there straight from Asia it’s an awful shock! Having said that I’m with you on the point that spending lots of money doesn’t necessarily mean better quality and it should! p.s. If doing a world trip with Australia New Zealand & South East Asia it’s best to start with the more expensive countries first and then work your way down rather than the other way around! Reply Bruno April 8 2016 at 854 am Great tips and thanks for showing exploring Sydney on a budget is possible! Reply Stephen Gollan April 8 2016 at 953 am Great look into Sydney! Its always good to see what other enjoy about a location that is quite traveled by many. Love the tips on how to visit Sydney on a budget. Sydney is a very expensive destination for most. So these tips can allow those on a tight budget to see this wonderful city! Thanks Matt Reply Kate April 8 2016 at 212 pm Getting a local train or transportation pass is always a GREAT way to save. We did that in Brussels Tokyo Bangkok and London. You can save $20-50! I’d also suggest just buying food from a grocery store you can make your own food for much cheaper. Or I suppose it’s never too late to go on a fasting diet . Reply Indrani April 8 2016 at 1152 pm These tips are going to get me richer. I don’t believe in splurging while traveling these tips are sure helpful. Reply Sophie April 9 2016 at 224 am Awesome guide! I’m going to Sydney in August and it will definitely be on a budget so this will come in handy 🙂 Reply Mia April 9 2016 at 654 am I couldn’t agree more! I used to live in Australia for 1.5 year and all that I would hear about Sydney is how expensive the city is. When I eventually came to visit Sydney I made an effort to mix in a few really cheap activities to keep the cost down. I quickly realized that the city has a lot of really cheap or free activities to do. Reply Sebrin April 9 2016 at 239 pm Oh man Sydney is such a killer! But I love these tips. I was lucky to do some of them like the nature walks and visiting the markets. It was perfection and it doesn’t feel like a free” type of event. Thanks for sharing Matt! Reply Lilly April 10 2016 at 238 pm Very helpful information Sydney is definitely on my to do” list but i haven’t been yet because of the high costs. This will surely help. Reply KD April 11 2016 at 801 pm At around 4pm most restaurants offer half price on their meals. I can sometimes get a bento box for just $5. So watch out for those. Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 952 am I found that the ferry across to Manly is a great way to take in a lot of the sites that you don’t really need to see up close for the couple of bucks that it takes you to get on there and go across. Plus Shelly Bay in Manly is one of the best free excursions you can do on. Also the Pylon Lookout next to the Harbour Bridge is a nice little but of insider-knowledge if you want a similar view but want to save yourself $230 AUD on going up the bridge. I think it cost me about $15 to get up there this was in 2012 but it satisfied me and my budget just as much. Thanks for the article Matt 🙂 Reply Wai April 14 2016 at 945 am The best way to survive in Sydney is to go with friends and rent an apartment. In september I rented a great apartment that could easily sleep 4 in Bondi for only $110 per night. Cheaper than a hostel and much more comfortable! Cooking at home and beers from the bottle shop will save you heaps. The cheapest food when I was there was definitely the sushi rolls that you can find everywhere. Around $3 for a roll and you can have lunch for $6-$9 depending on how much you eat. Reply Alegna January 26 2017 at 740 pm Don’t forget to go to the BYO restaurants. The cheaper restaurants either don’t charge corkage or it’s minimal. Reply Ryan Biddulph April 14 2016 at 832 pm Hi Matt We’ve passed thru Sydney twice. Once going to and from Fiji. We paid $100 USD for a room about as big as a shoe box right by the airport. Tis what it tis right? Overall a fab city and hey it’s the cost of living bit. Even if we paid $22 for a 3 minute taxi ride to the airport Sydney is A-OK with me. Signing off from sunny NYC. Ryan Reply Rekha April 18 2016 at 716 am I have found your post informative. This post is quite helpful for budget travelers like me. Being a nature lover and history buff I would like to visit nature rich destinations where I can capture the natural beauty of the places. I found you have mentioned about the same in your post. May I have some more information about hill areas around Sydney where I can explore the natural hill surroundings? Reply Cindee June 14 2016 at 339 am Two of the best things to do for free or almost free is to walk over the harbour bridge there is a pedestrian path along the side and take the circular quay to manly ferry. Reply Mike July 11 2016 at 514 am Great post Matt especially like the part about hitting up the backpacker bars for a cheap drink. I find they usually offer a better atmosphere as well. I have also found some pretty good drink/ food/ tourist deals on a Facebook page called – Sydney Deals. It’s worth checking out if you’re going to be in Sydney for a while and want to save some money! Reply john August 2 2016 at 106 pm I love Australia went I traveled there in 2012. specially Sydney it was my final stop after a year being there to perfect way to end I remember walking under the harbor bridge and seeing the Sydney opera house looking back at me it was like seeing a mirage walking through the desert. An incredible feeling. Reply carl January 4 2017 at 253 am Hi Matt I can relate to your blog post Australia is a way more expensive than the other countries I have visited.

Reply Sam November 5 2017 at 1117 am Being a Sydney Sider I can vouch for the fact that if you are not thinking about your entertainment budget it can be a super expensive affair. Simple things like having drinks in an average bar can cost well over $50 AUD. That’s why I think this is a brilliant article and it can help the tourists and the locals to enjoy Sydney and without spending too much. Reply Morkal February 16 2018 at 607 am Hey Matt! Thanks for amazing tips. Yes Australia is a great country and Sydney is one of the most expensive cities in Australia. We all can control phone cost shopping cost hotel rent control and food cost But we skip the cost of flight tickets. If anyone wants to control this cost then Sekap travels is one of the best options for you as per my view. Sekap travels provide you cheap flight tickets for Australia at a reasonable rate.

Today this former Cistercian abbey which is situated between Heidelberg and Stuttgart is not only the most complete and best-preserved monastic complex north of the Alps it is also a particularly fine example of medieval architecture and since 1993 a UNESCO World Heritage site. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Particularly impressive is the extent to which the original buildings and the picture they provide of cloistered life have been maintained. This a place where you can get a detailed insight into the life and work of the Cistercian order from the 12th to the 16th century. The monastery courtyard is still surrounded by its towers imposing living quarters and outbuildings and a defensive wall approximately one kilometre long. The cloister refectory and the beautiful portico from around 1220 known as Paradise have been largely preserved in their original condition. Maulbronns construction began in 1147 when according to legend a mule discovered a natural spring at the site where the fountain now stands. The triple-naved basilica the oldest part of the complex was consecrated in 1178. In the separate monks chancel the 92 seats of the 15th century choir stalls mark the perimeter of the monastery at that time. The facilities needed to service a monastery of this size can be seen in the grounds with their adjoining agricultural fields and ingenious water-management system which along with the medieval cloister buildings have also been preserved intact. During the Reformation the monastery was closed and the buildings used as a Protestant school. Today it houses a school for classical languages whose past pupils include the astronomer Johannes Kepler the poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the author Hermann Hesse. Tip for your visit the three most beautiful medieval monasteries in the northern Black Forest – Maulbronn Hirsau and Alpirsbach – can be explored as part of a monastery route. read more » « less Opening times tours and tips Opening times March to October 9am to 5.30pm daily last admission 4.45pm November to February Tuesday to Sunday 9.30am to 5pm last admission 4.15pm Further information www.kloster-maulbronn.de Maulbronn Monastery Complex is part of the Holy and hospitable UNESCO route.

Laid out in the form of a Latin cross it is one of Germanys largest and most important Romanesque buildings and was intended to be no less than the largest church in the western world when building work began in 1030. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Speyer Cathedral in the Rhineland-Palatinate region has long since ceased to be the largest church in the western world. However it is still the worlds largest surviving Romanesque church. Construction began under Salian Emperor Konrad II and the church was consecrated in 1061 under his grandson Heinrich IV. Its huge triple-naved vaulted basilica is the central element of a design that is thought to have greatly influenced Romanesque architecture in the 11th and 12th century. The mighty but eminently well-proportioned main building consisting of the nave and transept with four towers in a symmetrical design inspired many other important churches. A central attraction that strongly reflects the spirit of the time is the fully preserved crypt which is the largest Romanesque columned hall in Europe. As the burial site for Salian Hohenstaufen and Habsburg rulers and their wives the crypt – and the cathedral itself – represent the ultimate symbol of medieval imperial power. The huge cathedral bowl outside the main door is certainly worth a visit. With a capacity of 1560 litres it had to be filled with wine by every new bishop to keep the people happy. Perhaps these are the origins of the Cathedral Wine Fair in spring at which Palatinate vineyards present their wines against the stunning backdrop of the cathedral. Every year in September and October the International Music Festival is held at Speyer Cathedral. It features concerts by choirs and orchestras as well as organ recitals. read more » « less Opening times tours and tips Opening times Speyer Cathedral and crypt November to March 9am to 5pm April to October 9am to 7pm Church services Sundays 7.30am 10am and 6pm closed to visitors during services Guided tours of the cathedral can only be booked through Speyer Cathedral Chapter Domkapitel domfuehrungen@bistum-speyer.de Imperial hall & viewing platform April to October Monday to Saturday 10am to 5pm Sunday 12 noon to 5pm Cathedral treasury at the Historical Museum of the Palatinate in Speyer 10am to 6pm daily Further information www.dom-zu-speyer.de Speyer Cathedral is part of the Holy and hospitable UNESCO route.

The medieval old town is one of the foremost examples of brick Gothic architecture and reflects Lübecks illustrious past as an early centre of international trade. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner In 1987 Lübecks old town became the first in northern Europe to be named a World Cultural Heritage site. Surrounded by water on all sides it has been dominated by seven church steeples since the Middle Ages. For centuries Lübecks name stood for freedom justice and prosperity. Today all the many Gothic Renaissance baroque and classical buildings narrow lanes and streets churches and abbeys merchants houses craftsmens yards and fortifications still tell of the heyday of Lübeck. Surrounded by water the old town with the seven towers of its five principal churches brings to life 1000 years of history and has been protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site thanks to its outstanding brick Gothic architecture. The site includes the quarter around the town hall the castle abbey the grand old patrician town houses between St. Peters Church and the cathedral the salt warehouses on the banks of the Trave river and the Holsten Gate the citys most famous landmark which is also an interactive museum. A harbour tour is the perfect way to round off any visit to Lübeck as is a visit to the merchants houses dedicated to Lübecks three Nobel prize winners Thomas Mann Willy Brandt and Günter Grass. If its that time of year you can visit the annual Travemünde Week just outside the town which offers a mix of first-rate sailing activities and fairground buzz. A tour of the bars at night is also an absolute must for any visitor to Lübeck when the sun goes down the numerous pubs restaurants bars and clubs come to life.

At the famous Deutsches Eck or German Corner where the Rhine and Moselle converge lies one of Germanys oldest and most beautiful towns – Koblenz. Vineyards forests and four mountain ranges form the backdrop to the city whose 2000-year history has given rise to beautiful churches and castles palatial residences and grand town houses. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The Romans and later the Teutonic Order were among the first to prize the majestic scenery of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. More recently UNESCO has recognised the areas outstanding beauty by awarding it world heritage status. Central to this heritage is the Deutsches Eck at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. In 1891 Kaiser Wilhelm II deemed this historic landmark given its name by the knights of the Teutonic Order the perfect site for a special monument. Here people could give thanks to his grandfather Wilhelm I the man who unified the German Empire. Alas the statue was reduced to rubble in 1945 and in May 1953 Theodor Heuss President of West Germany declared the remaining plinth a poignant monument to German unity. Finally in 1993 a replica of the statue was raised into position on the plinth where it towers majestically over the two rivers at a height of 37 metres. Every year the impressive structure attracts more than two million visitors. Towering on the opposite side of the Rhine is Ehrenbreitstein Europes second-largest preserved fortress. At nearly 120 metres above the river this is the perhaps the best place to enjoy views of Koblenz. Just beyond the fortress lies the site of the 2011 Federal Horticultural Exhibition now a popular public park and outdoor venue. The cable car built especially for the show is still in operation transporting visitors back to the western bank of the Rhine – the perfect place to begin a leisurely stroll through the beautiful old quarter. French joie de vivre and German tradition have produced a truly unique cultural fusion in Koblenz characterised by cosy wine taverns a genuinely welcoming atmosphere and great food – from gourmet cuisine to hearty fare. People come to Koblenz from all over the world to soak up this charm amid the narrow lanes tucked-away corners and delightful city squares. A stroll through the old quarter could begin at the four towers as the oriels of four baroque houses are known – one on each corner of the areas main street crossing. At the Hauptwache guardhouse from 1689 guns flags muskets and horns serve as a reminder of the soldiers who carried out police duties here. Further along is the Schängel fountain which stands in the courtyard of the town hall. This famous landmark harks back to the time around 1800 when Koblenz belonged to France and a conspicuously large number of boys were christened Jean – which became Schang and then Schängel in the local dialect. We can only assume that some of these boys must have been rascals because at irregular intervals the figure in the fountain spits out a powerful stream of water onto unsuspecting passers-by! The Deutscher Kaiser is also worth a visit. This is not another monument as its name might suggest but a Gothic tower house that now boasts a delightful restaurant on the ground floor. Its the perfect spot to enjoy a glass of fine wine before taking the ferry to Stolzenfels Castle. Your boat passes by the Electoral Palace en route to this most impressive example of early Prussian art and cultural history. The people of Koblenz appreciate contemporary art as well as is clear from the Ludwig Museum close to the Deutsches Eck. Its collection contains mainly post-1945 art including works by Pablo Picasso Jean Dubuffet Pierre Soulages and Serge Poliakoff to name but a few. Its such an exciting contrast modern art in medieval walls classics of the modern age in a captivating historical city. But dont take our word for it.

Churches towers and bridges great culture and glittering festivals Erfurt offers medieval charm in abundance and a rich history combined with a lust for life and a warm welcome. Situated at the crossroads of ancient German and European trade routes the regional capital of Thuringia has always been popular with important intellectuals and is a self-assured proud centre of innovation as well as a magnet for visitors from around the world. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Martin Luther once praised Erfurt as a City of Towers in reference to the lofty spires and steeples of the citys 25 parish churches 15 abbeys and monasteries and ten chapels. Especially striking are St. Marys Cathedral and the Church of St. Severus together these two masterful examples of German Gothic design form an architectural ensemble like no other in Europe. Inside the cathedral there is a particularly impressive chancel with a series of 13 colourful stained glass windows each nearly 18 metres high. The cathedral is also home to the magnificent Gloriosa the worlds largest free-swinging medieval bell. Nowadays the church towers cast their shadows over the lovingly restored half-timbered houses and beautiful Renaissance buildings of the historic city centre where one of Germanys finest open-air theatre events the Cathedral Steps Theatre Festival takes place every year. The Augustinian Monastery in which Martin Luther spent five years of his life the Prediger Church and the fortifications of Petersberg Citadel are superb examples of medieval and modern-era architecture. The Old Synagogue Europes oldest fully intact synagogue also merits a visit. It houses an exceptional Jewish history museum featuring a Jewish ritual bath discovered nearby in 2007. But Erfurt is more than just a city of sacred buildings – it is a city of bridges too. 142 of them span the river Gera its tributaries and the Flutgraben a broad canal running alongside the former city walls. The most famous of these bridges is undoubtedly the Merchants Bridge which has the longest row of inhabited buildings on any bridge in Europe. Arts and crafts galleries cosy wine taverns music shops and antique dealers are the hallmarks of the Merchants Bridge whose Merchants Bridge Festival is the biggest and best old town festival in Thuringia. Every year the Middle Ages spring back to life in the lanes surrounding the bridge for a celebration involving ancient crafts historical song jesters and a colourful array of stalls. While this may be Erfurts most famous festival its far from its only one. Theres also the Petersberg Festival that celebrates military traditions in the heart of the old quarter and in the early months of the year carnival brings the party atmosphere to town. In springtime Erfurts pottery market is full of ceramic treasures whilst in the summer the flower and garden market transforms the cathedral square into a colourful fairytale scene. The crop market in the autumn meanwhile offers local produce such as fruit vegetables and honey. Every year on 10 November singing children proceed through the citys streets and alleyways with home-made lanterns on their way to the Martinmas market. This is done in honour of St. Martin and to commemorate the church reformer Martin Luther. And during Advent when the Christmas market is up and running an enticing aroma of cinnamon ginger roasted almonds and pfefferkuchen biscuits wafts through the city. But the people of Erfurt dont spend all their time partying they also like to enjoy the citys cultural treasures such as the Thuringian Folk Museum on Juri-Gagarin-Ring or Anger Museum the citys art gallery. Another favourite is the municipal museum inside the Haus zum Stockfisch a beautiful Renaissance house. When youre in Erfurt theres no end of things to look forward to. And in this resplendent city you may even experience a renaissance of your own. read more » « less Highlights A medieval shopping mall the Merchants Bridge » On the trail of Luther at the Augustinian monastery » Jewish culture and the Old Synagogue » An imposing fortification Petersberg Citadel » Old Synagogue Erfurt » Augustinian monastery Erfurt » The High Cathedral of St. Mary in Erfurt » Related topics Luther Historic Highlights of Germany Discover more in the local region European rosarium Sangerhausen.

Lifestyle joie de vivre or lebensart – whatever you call it Munich has it in spades. It might be down to the clear blue skies or simply the citys beauty but one things for certain the people of Munich always like to show their best side whether theyre in a beer garden on one of the exclusive shopping streets or in Bayern Munichs stadium. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner A modern cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage as suave as it is easygoing buzzing and yet tranquil. Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital. You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich but it doesnt hurt. Besides these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions. Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. That said undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square – it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls. The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the Hofbräuhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around. Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses. Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market – from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies. But take note bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle – so dont be tempted to try least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse Maximilianstrasse Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal. Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques. For a far more affordable not to mention more relaxed shopping experience head to Munichs pub and club quarter which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district but also extends around Glockenbachviertel Gärtnerplatz square and Müllerstrasse. The area is as renowned for its party atmosphere as it is for its alternative shops its relaxed atmosphere and its vibrant LGBT scene. A trip to the English Garden doesnt cost you a penny and Munichs very own piece of paradise situated between the Isar and the city centre is the ultimate chill-out zone. From lazing around or watching people master the latest craze of slacklining better still have a go yourself to the insane fun of surfing the Eisbach river anything goes in the park. Add to that two of Munichs most beautiful beer gardens one at the Chinese Pagoda the other at a picturesque lakeside spot and youve got the perfect recipe for a relaxing afternoon. These are the beer gardens where youll find an eclectic crowd who live life to the full in the shade of ancient chestnut trees. Thats the Munich way. The beer gardens came to be called cellars or keller – as in Salvatorkeller Löwenbräukeller and Hofbräukeller – because brewers once kept their beer underground to keep it cool and soon hit upon the idea of selling it from the very same spot. This was the start of a sacred tradition that as luck would have it is alive and well among locals today. The people of Munich are also proud of the citys museums many of which are of international standing such as the Deutsches Museum the worlds biggest science and technology museum the Alte Pinakothek the Neue Pinakothek the Pinakothek der Moderne and the Lenbachhaus Museum. Then theres the Glyptothek Museum the State Collections of Antiques and the Brandhorst Museum with its breathtaking collection of modern art from 1945 onwards. Here in Munichs Art Quarter however youll also find charming little bars cosy cafés and pretty boutiques yet another example of how the Munich lifestyle combines culture with the finer things in life. The BMW Museum has the citys automotive heritage covered while the stars of Bayern Munich show teams visiting the Allianz Arena another side to the citys unique lifestyle what its like to always be on top. Even if youre not a Bayern Munich fan its still well worth trying to get a ticket to see them play. The stadium atmosphere alone is world-class and guaranteed to give you goosebumps. And you wont be surprised to discover that the Allianz Arena is one of the worlds most spectacular stadiums. It is after all in Munich. read more » « less Highlights Bavaria Filmstadt  the kingdom of illusions » Allianz Arena Home advantage » Munich Pinakotheken galleries a world of art in Maxvorstadt » English Garden Munich a haven of relaxation in the big city » Marienplatz  Munichs magnificent main square » The Hofbräuhaus beer hall the measure of Munich » The ancestral home of the Bavarian rulers the Wittelsbach residence » Pure driving pleasure BMW Welt » Fatherly pride Nymphenburg Palace » A beer festival for the world Oktoberfest » A gourmets paradise the Viktualienmarkt food market » 24-hour party people Glockenbachviertel and Gärtnerplatz » Identity and culture the Jewish Museum » Century-defining works the Brandhorst Museum » The Olympic Park » German Museum » Lenbachhaus » Alte Pinakothek » Neue Pinakothek » Haus der Kunst » Munich Residenz » Munich Frauenkirche — The Cathedral of Our Dear Lady » Related topics Museums Traditions and customs Shopping Discover more in the local region Visit your favourite animal at Augsburg Zoo! » Herrenchiemsee Palace – a fairytale refuge for the fairytale king. » Lokschuppen Exhibition Centre Rosenheim » Wieskirche Pilgrimage Church » Highlights close Bavaria Filmstadt  the kingdom of illusions Do you want to stand on a real film set where famous movies have been shot?

Why Going Alone to Mozambique Was the Best Decision Ever 01/27/2016 by Kristin 32 Comments I walked along the beach after jumping off the boat from an amazing day of SCUBA diving in Tofo Mozambique. The white sand squeaked under my feet and the waves rolled in lazily. I had just seen a whale shark underwater and was ecstatic. It had taken me several days of long bus journeys to get there but I made it and it turned out to be more wonderful than I’d imagined. I wasn’t wearing any shoes hadn’t even considered makeup in weeks and was smiling from ear to ear on a sunny day at one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It wasn’t long before I spotted my crew of friends farther down on the sand. I met them a week prior when on my walk back to my guesthouse I passed by a few friendly-looking faces in the hammocks and stopped to chat with them for a while. I didn’t realize it then but they’d turn out to be one of the best most solid crews I’ve ever met while traveling if not the most amazing to date. I ended up spending the rest of my three weeks in Africa with them practically joined at the hip. We were a crew of 20 and 30-somethings from different corners of the world some from the US and some from Australia Switzerland and Canada. Some were Peace Corps volunteers and the rest had arrived there thanks to word of mouth just like I had. They’d been digging a giant hole in the sand for hours that day. It was the brain-child of Jonas a 20-year old from Switzerland whose spirit animal is undeniably a meerkat. He could not let go of the idea of making this happen and had spoken about it for days. His master plan was to make a hole big enough to fit nine people because that’s just what you do when you have a group of intelligent people together in paradise with a lot of time on their hands isn’t it? He was so enthusiastic about it that everyone got on board because why not? They must have literally moved tons of sand As soon as I arrived they chided Kristin’s here!” which I have to tell you is one of the nicest things to hear when you rock up to a group of people. Feeling genuinely welcomed is right near the top of my list of favorite feelings in the world. The hole was ridiculously huge and when it came time to bury them so that we could get some photos before sunset everyone around helped from the beach boys who had been selling us coconuts for the past two weeks to random passers-by who decided to get involved. Who wouldn’t right? It was too bizarre and wonderful to walk away from. Pre-burial Everyone got involved I helped too. Promise I volunteered to be the photographer since I love that role and don’t do well with tight confined spaces. It was a good choice. A really ridiculously good looking couple from South Africa – oh and my friends too – who helped out with the cause and it was the guy’s birthday too! They don’t know what’s coming… Because we decided that if you want your garden to grow… Wait for it… You have to water it right? Boom Later that night showered and happy in the warmth of the night we sat in a circle waiting on our food. It hadn’t arrived yet because in Mozambique it takes at least two hours from ordering to eating. That’s when you just shrug and say T.I.A” this is Africa and learn the meaning of patience. We decided in the true spirit of Thanksgiving as it was November 26 that with or without a feast we ought to share what we were most grateful and thankful for. When it got to Caspar an incredibly well-spoken tall brown-haired and green-eyed Aussie who had been studying working and living in Mozambique for the past two years he said something that brought tears to my eyes The more he has traveled the world the more he has come to fully believe that people are fundamentally good. He expressed that every single time that things started to look hopeless someone would come along and change everything. He referenced times he had to hitchhike on the side of the road got lost or just openly appealed for help when he needed it and it always found him. The amount of kindness that people have shown him over and over every single time he has had no choice but to rely on it has reaffirmed this belief. His words resonated because I’ve long felt the very same thing. Every time I thought things were hopeless such as when I was lost and someone showed me the way when I stood on the side of the road hoping for a ride and got one or I lost my debit card and someone bailed me out I was also shown that people are fundamentally good. Nothing has ever been so catastrophic that it couldn’t be redeemed by a random act of kindness. The majority of the time it was someone who had less than I did or was a perfect stranger who gave the most. I often wondered and was even told by others that I was naive and idealistic for feeling this way and that those things don’t just happen to everyone. To hear him say the very same thing that I felt down to my core finally affirmed what I know to be true The world and the people in it are more kind giving and similar to each other than unkind greedy and different from each other. Even without speaking the same language we can find a common ground. It also confirmed that what you put out there is what you get back. He and I are both open and giving but also understanding and not afraid to ask for help. People will give when they feel that kind of loving and receptive spirit and when people ask me for help I pay it forward. I felt so lucky in that moment to be surrounded by such positivity. It’s one of those things you optimistically hope for but know better than to expect when you travel. It’s a rarity to find such wonderful people to share your time with and the kind of thing that can only happen when all of the right situations come to pass that allow you to meet the people who create that spark. I owe these moments to traveling solo and being open to serendipity. It brings along the spirit that travel has always carried for me An unexpected adventure with people you have only just met but who could be your friends for life. Every new encounter has the potential to change your trajectory and you simply never know what or who in the world might come your way next. That’s the spice of life isn’t it? I can’t help but think that if I’d gone ahead with the original Mozambique plan with J I wouldn’t have ever met this crew. I might not have ended up at Tofo at the same time might not have walked up and met them that day and probably wouldn’t have had any attention to give to anyone else. So thank you J. In the end everything came into being just the way it was meant to and I’m glad that you found love. I did too.

Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1041 am Really was so much fun! Reply Brianna says 01/27/2016 at 915 am This was just beautiful. Incredibly inspiring words here. Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1041 am Thank you <3 Reply Miriam says 01/28/2016 at 1255 am This is a great example of how solo travel rewards you with unique experiences! I remember reading on your Instagram that you were heading to Mozambique by yourself and thinking you were really brave. I’m a solo traveler myself but Africa has always been the one continent I wouldn’t go to alone. I’m glad to see how well it went for you! Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1041 am I actually went to South Africa solo first which is more dangerous at least statistically. I love both countries and all of the surroundings and even solo you don’t have to fear Africa. It’s a wonderful place full of wonderful people. It’s just a little more ‘advanced’ if you will as far as difficulties and things you have to be aware of 🙂 Reply Taylor says 01/28/2016 at 519 am Kristin I usually read your articles when they come in my inbox and think things like damn I wish I was in Iceland right now!.” But today I had to click through and comment because this is EXACTLY how I felt traveling solo and exactly what no one else ever really seems to understand when my mom worried for my safety or friends questioned my choices to go it alone. When all my money was stolen and other backpackers paid for my way from Thailand to Cambodia when a stranger paid my border fees in Costa Rica because my debit card got eaten and I would have been kicked off the bus. People ARE good and my absolute favorite part of traveling solo is finding these crews of soul mate friends you didn’t even know you had. I’m married now so traveling solo long term will probably never happen again for me but I would honestly hope that the hubby and I are fortunate to meet another great crew. I’ve met three such ragtag groups around the world in my whole life and I am still friends with every one of them. Absolutely love this and damnnit I want to go to Mozambique! Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1039 am Thanks for reading and for commenting Taylor 🙂 I’ve had locals help me out of sticky situations too and what people who haven’t traveled alone don’t have the chance to experience is the kind of generosity that comes along when you really are alone and close to hitting rock bottom and you wonder what in the world you’re even doing. Then someone realizes you’re alone you need help and they give it to you. It’s such a wonderful thing and it has happened for me at the 11th hour many times. So glad you’ve experienced the same! Reply Kristen Sarra says 01/28/2016 at 1200 pm I’ve been waiting for your Africa posts! It really resonated with me when you wrote about your plans falling through and then deciding to forge on anyway. I’ve been reflecting lately on how many adventures I would have missed out on if I had relied on other people. I too have had travel companions drop out at the last minute and as upset as that sometimes made me I still went on and had some of the best adventures of my life. Most recently was in Portugal where I dined with locals had a brief romance went canyoning for the first time and indulged at an expense resort in Pinhao up in the Douro Valley. Had my friend not have dropped out of the trip 3 weeks before I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that as she had wanted to stick to the touristy beaches down South – the beaches which I wound up completely ignoring as I was just having too much fun up North. I guess what I’m trying to say is I feel ya gurllll.” Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 236 am Haha awesome! It’s so true that going alone lets you just do whatever the heck you want. It’s something I really value and that kind of freedom is beautiful. I hope more people just try it even just once because you can have such a real rich adventure that way. Reply Ijana says 01/28/2016 at 503 pm This is one of my favorite articles of yours ever! I totally agree with everything you said about solo travel and I really hope to be able to experience that in Mozambique one day. It sounds like everything was set up just the way you needed it to even if it didn’t seem like that at first when your travel partner backed out 🙂 Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 234 am Most definitely. I feel so lucky that it all worked out positively and I started to wonder if it was just a fluke but when Caspar said what he said I realized it’s not. When you bravely put yourself out there it tends to work out. So glad you liked this post! <3 Reply Jimmy Dau says 01/28/2016 at 736 pm What a great read totally feel the same way. Viva solo travels! Reply Kate says 01/29/2016 at 257 am ” It’s an unexpected adventure with people you have only just met but who you could be you friends for life.” So true….. I’m so grateful for the amazing best friends I have in my life right now who I met on my last trip… that alone wants me to carry on travelling forever as I cannot imagine life without them now. Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 344 am Totally feel the same. Some of the people I’m best friends with now I met because I was traveling and I can’t imagine life without them! I can’t imagine life without the experiences I’ve had either. It’s pretty crazy isn’t it? Reply Aisling says 01/29/2016 at 736 am So glad you had such an amazing time! I followed your trip on snapchat and did feel a little bad that you were so nervous before leaving! But it looks like it turned out great for you. You are right you should live your life for yourself and not wait for J or any other person to determine where/when you are going to go! Delighted you had such a good time! Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 822 am Aw didn’t mean to make anyone feel bad! I’m pretty open on Snapchat though. Sometimes if I’m really alone it’s nice because it feels like there is still someone there with me sharing it with me and it’s nice when people send little messages through 🙂 Thanks for the love! <3 Reply Sahra says 01/29/2016 at 948 am this is so fun! how brave of you to travel alone and how fun that you met such a cool group of other travelers! I generally. travel with my boyfriend and while we always find fun people to chat with we have yet to encounter such a group like this! Hope you enjoy the rest of your travels <3 Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 1259 pm It’s a bit tougher as a couple I think simply because people aren’t usually as likely to approach a couple as a solo traveler. I have found that when I’m with a guy friend even if we’re not dating people think we are and get approached less by others. It’s too bad but I guess as a solo traveler I typically don’t approach couples either. Reply Emily says 01/30/2016 at 242 am This was wonderful! I had a somewhat similar experience in Africa as well! I had been meeting a lot of people while I was in Europe who had just traveled in Morocco and takes about how much they loved it. I wanted to go too but was nervous about going alone. Then I remembered that getting out of my comfort zone was the reason I started traveling in the first place. So I booked the ticket. It was an incredible 3 weeks and I met some AMAZING people both locals and travelers alike. It reminded me why I loved to travel. Just what I needed at the time 🙂 Reply Kristin says 01/30/2016 at 332 am Yay! I have to remind myself of the same every time I go somewhere new by myself. I’m always nervous and in the end I’m always happy I did it. Reply jeniffer says 02/06/2016 at 600 pm I really want to visit Mozambique where do I start? Any travel agencies you recommend or is it better to plan everything out yourself? Thanks ! This would be my first time visiting that continent so I have no experience.. Reply Kristin says 02/10/2016 at 354 pm I didn’t go with a tour agency I just winged it and I tend to prefer that method. There’s more on that here https//www.bemytravelmuse.com/mozambique-travel-blog/ Reply Brenna says 02/10/2016 at 734 am Beautiful beautiful story Kristin. I totally agree with what’s being said here – that people are fundamentally good. It’s a wonderful thing to realise. Plus now I really want to go to Mozambique! Reply Kristin says 02/10/2016 at 1232 pm I bet you’d love it Brenna! It has all the wonderful characteristics about Africa that I love – beautiful lovely people and great food! Reply Nikita says 02/10/2016 at 457 pm Wow beautiful! Nothing like serendipitously finding your tribe. It also makes me feel good to read this as I’m a bit sick of being called naive for believing in the power of empathy and positive energy. Though those who travel a lot and cheaply usually agree. Mozambique looks gorgeous! I’ll have to make it there some day for sure. Reply Kristin says 02/11/2016 at 626 am That’s wonderful! Let us know how it goes for you! I LOVE that part of the world so much Reply Ella says 02/11/2016 at 917 am What an amazing post and I couldn’t agree with you more! The more he has traveled the world the more he has come to fully believe that people are fundamentally good.” …When I read those words my inner response was Yes! Finally someone who gets it!”. Just like others have said before me I’m also a little bit sick of being called naive and idealistic but I’ve also come to realise that the people I get those criticisms from are the people who don’t bother to step out into the world and be open themselves. And I get it. It takes trust and to trust takes courage and a lot of people are afraid of getting hurt… but I’ve noticed that if you’re open and have peaceful intentions people will recognise that and will reciprocate with their openness and peaceful intentions. Really great post! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 02/11/2016 at 1224 pm Totally! That’s how I felt too. You get out of life and your encounters with people what you give to them at least that’s what I’ve found. Being happy approachable and open are all required to get the same in return. People are lovely all over the world and I firmly believe that! Reply Kristin says 03/12/2016 at 1237 pm What a small world! Drew’s a cool dude. Had the pleasure of hanging a bit in Tofo and Vilanculos while he was on school holidays. Reply Phumike says 05/10/2017 at 313 pm So much fun. Planning to be there coming month anyway. I hope it will be more exciting as yours. I have been looking for a clue and how to go about it. Thanks for sharing your experience.

I follow the fish sharks and especially nudibranchs extremely bright and colorful sea slugs all around Asia always looking for the next best dive spot. It only made sense that based on this underwater addiction I’d head to the Philippines to see what it had to offer after many positive recommendations from other travelers. Upon arrival I was quickly overwhelmed by the myriad of options. As is often the best plan of action I took to my Facebook fan page and you guys per usual came back with some excellent recommendations. A liveaboard dive trip consists of 3-4 dives per day 3-4 meals per day and generally living on the boat like a sailor or pirate! for around 6 days. A dive boat in Coron After some excellent liveaboard experiences in Komodo Indonesia and the Similan Islands in Thailand I knew I wanted a repeat. Enter Rags II which ended up being an excellent choice for a liveaboard trip through the Coron Wrecks and Apo Reef. Though I was initially afraid that the typhoon might have damaged these reefs to the point of ruining the diving experience I was glad to see that the damage was minimal. Fishermen near the boat in the afternoon There weren’t nearly as many options for liveaboards in the Philippines as there had been elsewhere in Southeast Asia. That said I was entirely happy with my choice because it included lots of diving a great crew all the milo I could want individually cooked meals three times per day this really impressed me! and unlimited beer in the evenings – the latter two of which are not common on dive ships. The diving itself was excellent giving me a chance to do around 10 wreck dives which is something I had very little experience with prior. Beautiful Coron It turns out that wreck diving is an incredibly interesting peek into the past. In this case the ships we dived were Japanese cargo and warships sunk during World War II. Following that was Apo Reef which was absolutely teeming with fish turtles and lots of sharks. One of the many islands around Coron My personal favorite which my divemaster found funny are nudibranchs. They are rather small sea slugs that I always get excited to spot because a it’s a challenge to find them and b they are almost always bright and amazing to look at. They’re also one thing that changes quite a bit depending on where in the world I’m diving. At this point with all of the diving I’ve done around Southeast Asia a lot of things repeat but nudibranchs don’t. That said seeing sharks and turtles never does get old. Here’s the best summation I can think of in two minutes with all of my favorites from the dive. Turn the music up! All-in-all it was excellent diving and reminded me of just how much I really do love liveaboards and diving in general. What are your favorite places to dive in Asia? Have you ever done a liveaboard?

Reply Kristin says 02/10/2014 at 844 pm They’d just prefer to not be around us. See them swimming away from me in the footage? They kept looking at me like ugh the human again – now I have to swim away.” These are reef sharks and they’re not aggressive and too small to eat me anyways.

I need to go diving again soon. Reply Catherine says 02/11/2014 at 426 am Just did a quick google for nudibranchs – can see why you like them they look fascinating! Great photos and amazing footage under the water 🙂 Reply Steph @ 20 Years Hence says 02/11/2014 at 810 pm Thanks for posting this report! Tony & I are thinking of heading back to the Philippines for 2 months in April and we do the same as you—go where the diving takes us—so we’re currently trying to narrow down our choices. It is not an easy task but I’m glad to see that Coron’s underwater life is as vibrant and healthy as ever. Reply Kristin says 02/12/2014 at 926 pm I def think it would be a great option Reply Scott says 02/12/2014 at 936 pm Hi Kristin This is Scott from Beijing China. I’m your new reader and I also have been to Coron myself. It’s such a beautiful small place! I loved it! Reply Stephanie says 02/14/2014 at 1104 am Absolutely beautiful! I love all of the posts about the Philippines. I’m planning on learning Tagalog both in Canada and – hopefully – in Asia and I find that there aren’t enough blog posts about travel in the Philippines. After reading this maybe I’ll have to finally fulfill my dream of learning to SCUBA dive when I’m over there. Thanks for sharing! Reply Kristin says 02/15/2014 at 541 am What a cool language to learn! It sounds like a combination of Malay and Spanish to me. More bloggers should go there for sure.

I haven’t made it to dive in Asia yet but I’m hoping to do so in 2014. I’ll definitely be looking at the Philippines as an option. Reply Kristin says 02/26/2014 at 938 pm It’s a great spot and Sipadan and Indonesia are amazing too Reply Joseph Thompson says 05/07/2014 at 335 pm I’ve been to Coron and I agree that it’s the best in the country if not one of the best in the world. The scenery above the surface is just breathtaking and you haven’t been underwater yet and when you finally start diving and seeing the wonders of the Coron deep it’s heavenly. I can’t wait to return to the place. Reply Danni @Leftnleavin says 12/03/2014 at 118 am I know I’m late in the game on this one but I am so happy to see what you posted about this experience. We are going in January and I think I am going to try and get dive certified in Coron. Did you hear hear of any good companies?

Reply Scubanomad says 10/07/2015 at 314 am I love diving in Thailand. Philippines looks great as well. How many days did you do liveaboard for? Reply Kristin says 10/12/2015 at 611 am I’ve done three now and they’ve always been for 6 days Reply Andrea says 02/18/2016 at 944 am Hello Kristin I love your Blog! I’m looking to make a 3 weeks diving travel between september to november for cheap but beautiful. Where can I go? Which is the best and cheapest periode ? XOXO Andrea Reply Kristin says 02/19/2016 at 656 am I thought Coron was great. There’s diving all over The Phils though. Reply JB says 03/31/2016 at 111 pm Looks amazing! It’s just been added to my short-list of next scuba-diving destinations 🙂 Reply sandy says 12/01/2016 at 201 am Hi Great video! I love diving too. planning on doing my divemasters next year could you please share how much it costed you to do the liveaboards in coron and in KomodoIve been following you Regards sandy Reply Kristin says 12/01/2016 at 1051 am It was something like $1500 or maybe $1800 if memory serves. Expensive but soooo worth it Reply Bella Santos says 12/18/2016 at 923 am So beautiful Big kisses from Portugal Fofurices Triviais Reply Bri says 08/06/2017 at 800 am I was curious as to whether or not you knew the requirements to dive. I just started diving but have yet to get certified so I was bummed when I was barred from diving in Costa Rica. I’m planning a trip to the Philippines and Indonesia and I don’t want that to happen again! Reply Kristin says 08/06/2017 at 649 pm You at least need your open water certification to dive anywhere. For this particular dive boat you need NOX and your advanced open water. Reply alexis says 07/11/2018 at 945 am Hi Do you have any other scuba recommendations other than this company. It looks like they are fully booked for the week I am looking to go scuba diving. Reply Kristin says 07/11/2018 at 1143 am That’s the only one I used but perhaps they can recommend another operator?

The Most Ridiculous Night of My Travels So Far 05/29/2013 by Kristin 23 Comments Day 232 Kristin” Krish the owner of my hostel in Cameron Highlands started bashfully Would you like to come to a local party tonight?” Through my travels I have learned that when invited to a local event the answer should always be ‘yes.’ When he added that the food was free and the draught Guinness was free-flowing my commitment solidified. It was a dinner and karaoke session that was hosted by the Cameron Highlands elite and I was invited. An hour or so before taking off Krish informed me that since I’d be the only foreigner there was no way I’d get out of performing karaoke on stage. I told Krish I can’t sing worth a damn to which he merely retorted an evil giggle. We arrived a short time later to a mixed crowd of Chinese-Malaysian and Indian-Malaysian attendees. Krish found it hilarious to introduce me to everyone as a singer from Hollywood thereby cementing my fate. The party started normally enough. We all filled our plates with delicious Indian food and socialized. Next an informational video about a dietary supplement played for about twenty minutes followed by a passionate and heartfelt weight loss story by an attendee. I could make out very little of what was said as I’m not a Malay speaker but found it odd that we had just eaten plates of fried food. Oh and next we were having cake. He finished by pointing to a pile of supplements and offering them for 20 ringgit apiece. It was quite a unique opening to a party. I had thought that perhaps in the hype of the moment it had been forgotten that a fake singer from California was in the audience but the speech was finished by thanking us especially ‘our special guest from California who would be singing later’ for attending. I cringed. A couple of songs went by sung by others – one a traditional Indian song and the other a love ballad in Chinese. Then Krish mischievously took over the microphone and announced that I would be singing a song. I hung my head downed my glass of Guinness for some liquid courage and walked over to the karaoke booth to make my choice. It was clear I was not getting out of this one. Have I mentioned that I have never ever sang in front of anyone? I mean the shower walls and the inside of my car have certainly heard my singing voice but even they were silently protesting I’m sure of it. My sincerest hopes that a Taylor Swift ballad would be available yes I do have her entire discography memorized and yes I am shameless in admitting that were dashed when the entire booklet appeared to be stuck in the 90s. Thankfully there was some Maroon 5 in there to save the day – er night as it were. I greeted the crowd in Chinese and apologized for my poor singing ability. This alone elicited cheers. The foreigner was speaking their language. I instantly felt better. Missing most of the high notes but managing not to shatter any glass or make anyone in the audience cover their ears and beg through bitter tears for the terrible noise to stop I finished the song and hoped I’d be done with it. I tried to run off stage. But no an encore was requested. This time I sang Killing Me Softly I can only manage deep-voiced songs to music that was a bit off and ran off stage insisting I was done singing damnit! If you’d like to see me singing feel free to subject yourself. I warn you however that I am really truly awful! Cringeworthy Karaoke in Malaysia from Kristin Addis on Vimeo. God don’t you wish you could dance that awkwardly? Or mess up several times on stage in front of tons of strangers? I know I once did. Goal reached Singing makes you young” says Krish. I think it just made me feel sober. The rest of the night saw me going around the room saying Hen gaoxin renshi ni” nice to meet you over and over – the crowd was suddenly much more interested in this foreigner who could speak some Chinese – followed by dancing to a variety of 50s swing hip-hop and Bollywood songs. I was not allowed to sit in my chair and resist dancing. Each time I tried I was pulled back up. It was my mastery of all of the moves to Gangnam Style that earned me the compliment you dance really well!”. I had a hunch that one day I’d be glad I had learned the leg-kick-wrist-knock combo. Somewhere between it all I found myself laughing and enjoying the small party in the misty mountains of Malaysia more than I would a booming Hollywood night club. It was easily the most ridiculous night of my trip thus far. And I mean that in the best possible way. Have you ever broken out of your comfort zone while traveling? Tell your story in the comments!

Yet it is very popular in many countries especially Asia. Thankfully you had a drink or two to help you relax a bit and I’m sure it helped. At least you had a good time in the end and a night not to forget. Reply Arianwen says 05/30/2013 at 1007 am I hope you’re now a karaoke convert! I find it interesting how much people’s ability and reactions differ in different countries. I’ve cleared a bar in Turkey by being so offensively bad and yet won a competition in Ecuador! Reply Kristin says 05/30/2013 at 855 pm Haha what?! I might have gone in the corner and cried if I cleared the bar. Reply Beth says 05/30/2013 at 427 pm Ohh this post made me laugh! And it also brought back cringe-worthy memories of when I was forced to sing the NATIONAL ANTHEM in front of 100 students in Peru! I wanted to DIE! They were cheering me on but it was awful. Supposedly there was no other way” for them to learn it a youtube video wouldn’t suffice I guess haha you just inspired me to write a story about that 😀 I really like your blog! I’m glad I found it 🙂 Keep the great stories comin’! Peace 🙂 Reply Kristin says 05/30/2013 at 856 pm The national anthem is so hard to sing! No way I could manage that one. Reply Auston says 06/01/2013 at 413 am Sounds like a crazy night! Sometimes traveling helps to bring you out of your shell and do things you might not normally do. Luckily when traveling you meet new people then move on quickly so you likely won’t see them again to relive your embarrassment 🙂 Reply Ayngelina says 06/06/2013 at 1148 am Good job! You’re brave 🙂 Reply Mackenzie says 07/17/2019 at 426 pm I stayed at Krish’s place in 2014. Similar start I was the only foreigner staying so he took me to hang out with some locals. Turns out there was a documentary film crew doing a travel special on the Cameron Highlands. Somewhere on the internet is footage of me spending 3 days with this Malaysian film crew … hiking eating strawberries visiting gardens and trying steamboat… all on camera! Krish– what a gem of a guy!

I wasn’t entirely comfortable with camping overnight to be honest. How had I ended up there of all places? Rewind an hour I’d stopped for gas well after sundown towards the end of my 10-hour drive down from the top of Arizona to Slab City and walked in to speak to the attendant. Pardon me for asking this but is there anywhere with cheaper gas around here?” The friendly attendant a talkative man in his mid-50s agreed it was overpriced and said it wouldn’t get any cheaper as I headed farther away from civilization. Lots of folks around here who have fallen on hard times are considering moving to Slab City” he added. Oh I thought it was just the Salvation Mountain art installation out there. There’s a town too? ” I asked. He gave me a little grin and said It’s the last free place in America.” Incredible I was on my way to see Salvation Mountain. It’s all I knew was out there. It’s the main attraction for most visitors to Slab City and I had wanted to see it for years but never really had a reason to go all the way over to Imperial County located almost 200 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Which is about 100 miles past nowhere to be exact. I would come to find that Slab City is a community of the misunderstood and the outcasts using what’s been left behind and rejected by others to create a free society that operates nearly independently of the rest of the world. It felt like entering a new dimension. I pulled into a pitch black Slab City and turned off my high beams. The tar road turned to dirt and after a few minutes I pulled off into the spot I’d found on the free camping website. I had spent the entire week prior to arriving in Slab City free camping in Utah’s public lands but this felt different. This felt disquieting. The next morning I awoke at the crack of dawn. After a restless sleep I headed back down the dirt road to Salvation Mountain. I wanted to see it without anyone else around! The oppressive sun already radiating down an incredible amount of heat at 5am beamed down that day with a vengeance. The land is dry barren and scorching. I pulled up to Salvation Mountain and felt as though I’d walked into the Candy Land board game. Little striped cats followed me around. Cheshire cats perhaps? I…just…wow Salvation Mountain was created by US Army veteran Leonard Knight using sand junkyard items wood and old tires he scavenged from the surrounding area. He built it using Navajo building methods with adobe sticks and lead-free paint. It features the sinner’s prayer front and center which was Knight’s inspiration. His devotion to Christianity happened later in his life at around age 35 when one day he had an epiphany while repeating the sinner’s prayer. To him it was simple accept Jesus into your heart repent your sins and be saved. He spent many years after that trying to spread the message and while various churches rejected him. They said that he was oversimplifying things. Clay + Paint His first artistic attempt to spread his ideas was a hot air balloon but after several attempts to take flight he admitted defeat and got to work on what would be his life’s greatest creation and the project that he would finish out his days on Salvation Mountain. It is clear everywhere you look that his enthusiasm and dedication never waned. Sitting at the top This isn’t just for Christians though. The artistic style is something that I think anyone could find appealing. For me it’s like visiting La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona or the White Temple in Thailand. Acts of devotion like this are moving and I love the modern art twist. Following the yellow brick road Knight passed away in 2014 but his work remains very much alive and is maintained by donations. It has won numerous awards and was named a ‘national treasure’ by Senator Barbara Boxer. The omnipresent sun After wandering I settled in for some morning coffee at the back of my van. Maybe I’d been hasty to mistrust Slab City. The next instant a mostly toothless man in his 50s came running wildly toward me mumbling. I thought at first that he was looking for someone and then it dawned on me that he’d asked for water. I handed over a bottle and he ran away again just as haphazardly and abruptly as he came. So I actually had entered a new dimension right? Then I certainly couldn’t leave yet. I started driving around Slab City and filming some of the other of the places I saw. That’s when I met Karibe. A gregarious fellow Karibe has lived in Slab City for two years and in that time built a little oasis on a slab with upcycled items and solar panels. He saw me filming and wondered if I wanted to see his place. A small voice in the back of my head begged ‘is this really a good idea?’ as I heard myself say yes.” Karibe gave away very little about himself but told me a lot about the community. Slab City got its name because of the concrete slabs left behind by the US military which used it as a base in the 1940s. Probably maybe doesn’t work anymore Roughly 150 people live there year-round some of whom have been there for over 30 years. Plenty more like yours truly come and camp for free and many snowbirds live there during the cooler months and then head north around March. I can’t blame them – in the summer temperatures can reach over 120°F 48°C! This isn’t just a squatter community Slab City is a place for people to create art to live off the grid to be de facto anarchists or simply to have a place to go when the cash flow runs dry. The place has a life and personality of its own. He says that a lot of the people there are ex-military worked in public service somehow and now live on social security or are young people who don’t want to be a part of mainstream society anymore. While I’ve seen plenty of squatter communities around the world Slab City is a beast all its own with a hostel its tagline is the greatest place on earth” library skate park live music on Saturday nights and even a bowling alley. At East Jesus Just about every semi permanent settlement is decorated. Take one of the more famous ones East Jesus for example. It’s a junkyard wonderland that feels a little bit like stepping into a world where Mad Max meets MOMA. So cool! In a lot of ways Slab City reminds me of Burning Man except this has an uneasy more sinister feel. It’s a community built on trust and codependence as much as it is a place that attracts fugitives addicts and freeloaders. How do they survive? Thanks to the plentiful sun they have an endless supply of electricity thanks to solar panels and water which according to Karibe gets delivered. Some people survive on social security and others hope that tourists will buy their wares or make donations. I’m left unable to really define slab city. Perhaps that is the idea. It’s a haven for those living on the fringe of society taking up residence in land that nobody else wants and living a life in opposition to the norm. So at least for now Slab City remains the last free place in America.

Aren’t road trips the best! Reply Roma says 06/21/2017 at 759 am Thanks for the Slab City update. We travelled through there a few months after Leonard died to see Salvation Mountain. Great to see the volunteers have maintained it it needs constant TLC. Really enjoyed all the counter-culture art in the city” but like you felt a disturbing undercurrent of energy. Living off-grid in the desert is harsh and the people who do so generally prefer to be left alone. I’m sure they are suspicious of all visitors and resent the intrusion. The negative vibes are strong and it would be a very dangerous place for anyone deemed insincere or exploitive . We chose not to camp. Reply Kristin says 06/22/2017 at 121 pm I actually do think they want to welcome people. In the video Karibe asks me to tell people to come visit him and when I walked into the library I was welcomed. People waved as I drove by and they decorate their places to the nines. I think the intention is to attract people but only the right kind of people. I agree they probably don’t like outsiders who don’t contribute and stay for a while. Reply Ijana Loss says 06/21/2017 at 759 am Woah what a cool place! When I get back to Vegas I gotta do a little road trip in this direction. I knew of Salvation Mountain but had no idea Slab City existed Reply GG says 06/21/2017 at 818 am It is great how you are now really exploring your old backyard after traveling the world and finding such little offbeat treasures like this. There is so much cool stuff within a day’s trip of home that sometimes people overlook. The interview was very entertaining Did you ever find out where Karibe is from? Did he get the Miss Cellaneous” reference . It was a neat place and he is humble and friendly and the enthusiasm over all the tourist sites at the end!. I liked the music in the video which was a good match. What amazes me the most is how they can handle the heat and have these neat cooling contraptions to survive in it that probably work better than the sophisticated air conditioning in NYC that break down all the time. In a way this carefree free expression environment seems very healthy allowing for 90 year olds to thrive although that is also up to genes!. GG Reply Ylvalie says 06/22/2017 at 608 am I really love and admire your sense of adventure! Reply Kristin says 06/22/2017 at 116 pm Thank you! Reply Borie Petrovay says 07/15/2018 at 1235 pm It is hard to describe the feelings I had climbing up on the mountain looking at the place this man built and he lived there until he died. Salvation Mountain is another story another place but it touches your heart to see how people save things we consider trash unworthy. I encourage everybody to come and see these historical places. Reply Kristin says 07/15/2018 at 1256 pm Agreed I think it’s amazing too. It’s a place that challenges commonly held beliefs and made me question my perceptions.

I’m riding a motorbike through Borneo with two people I met only a few days ago.” Neil had a valid point. We had only met a few days before randomly in a dorm before deciding to climb Mount Kinabalu together in one day. A few days before that I had met Andrew a guy from Scotland who had told me he planned to motorbike around Sabah the northern state of Malaysian Borneo for a few days. The three of us ended up meeting up by chance back in Kota Kinabalu Sabah’s largest city and decided to take the trip together. Things started to go awry before we even took off. It seemed there was no real need to book a couple bikes ahead of time so we didn’t. When the morning came that we wanted to get going of course the bikes had been rented out. A few were getting fixed in the shop and would be back in the afternoon. We waited. Finally the bikes arrived and we were off albeit much later than planned – stopping once in search of rope as the bags were slipping out of place on the back of Neil’s bike. Some friendly locals gave us some and we were on our way again. The series of unfortunate events All seemed to be going well until an hour out of Kota Kinabalu the back tire of the bike Andrew and I were riding went flat. Now what? A beautiful however remote place to be stuck Extremely luckily there was a small convenience store a few meters away that happened to have a pump and spanners. Andrew took the good bike and rode 12km to the closest town in search of a new inner tube for the tire. Without his wallet. The shop owner’s wife sat and had a conversation with me while we waited. She called me ‘sister’ and seemed astonished that I had truly traveled the whole of Southeast Asia solo. She expressed concern that we were motorbiking all the way through Sabah. Very dangerous” she warned. I assured her that we had known that getting into it. An hour passed and I started to get a bit concerned. Finally he showed up with a truck following him. A pair of locals had lent him the money for the tube and followed him all the way back to the bikes. Another local fixed the tire for us expecting no compensation in return. I had encountered such friendliness amongst locals all over Malaysia but still we were blown away. The rain came and went. The sunset in the sky was brilliant. The surrounding rice paddies and natural beauty was astounding. Just as it became dark we found ourselves 30km from the Tip of Borneo – our first stop. Just as we turned onto the bumpy and rocky back road to the tip the tire popped again. Neil went ahead with the good bike while Andrew and I stayed behind with the broken one. He pushed the bike and I carried the helmets. We knew it would all work out and casually admired the starry sky and spoke about life and travels. Thirty or so minutes later a pickup truck arrived to save the day er night as it were. The Tip and the 300km adventure The next day brought me the most beautiful beach I have encountered in Southeast Asia. I know I know I say that all the time but this beach was simply incredible almost deserted and full of white sand and clear blue water. Neil and Andrew got to work replacing the tire and I got to work taking pictures because that’s what I do best in these kinds of situations. See how helpful I was? Just beyond the trees Ah cloud porn Blue blue blue The rocky tip ‘Twas THAT blue. Seriously. A beautiful cove From there it was time to take on the next 300km of the journey through palm plantations and general nothingness. The roads were somewhat rough in places but we managed without breaking any limbs. Which I understand is a good thing given Andrew had heard that if you’re going to crash a motorbike in those remote jungles you’re better off dying than going to a hospital. The worst was that Neil ran out of gas only a half a kilometer outside of the coastal town of Sandakan where I parted ways with the boys. They were heading back up to Kota Kinabalu and I would be heading south to dive in Sipadan. In the end I was thankful for the adventure. Through flat tires rice paddies beautiful sunsets skies full of stars rainstorms and filthy clothes it was something I’ll always be glad I did. Andrew and Neil I’m left with the same quote running through my head said by none other than Winnie the Pooh As soon as I saw you I knew an adventure was going to happen.” Do it Yourself There are two places to rent motorbikes and scooters in Kota Kinabalu Bunibon Backpackers and Gogosabah be advised this is closed on Sundays. The other option is to rent a car from a stall near the jetty for the best rates. Be sure to take extra petrol. We tried to fill empty water bottles at a Shell station and were told ‘no’ by the attendant. They didn’t care at the smaller more remote petrol stations however. We needed to fill 4 1-litre bottles to make it between gas stations. Bring a rain jacket as you most likely will get rained on. Bring an adventurous spirit.

Enough to put a smile on one’s face on a gloomy Monday afternoon in London 🙂 I spent 8 years in Singapore but never got a chance to go to Borneo when it was so close and now sitting in London I have that itch to go there ASAP.

Of course all adventure are not without mishaps but it’s awesome you made it through! I’ve been dying to do a motorbike tour somewhere in SE Asia. Do you have a motorcycle license btw? And why is that area you were driving through dangerous? Great read Kristin 🙂 Reply Kristin says 06/24/2013 at 1236 am Haha I doubt any of the backpackers who rent motorbikes in SE Asia actually have licenses back home. No I had never driven a bike prior to Thailand. It’s just dangerous in general to ride the motorbikes but some of the roads were bad and there were no hospitals anywhere nearby in case we crashed. Glad we didn’t! Reply Megan says 06/21/2013 at 255 pm I’ve always wanted to do a motorbike adventure! I had lofty intentions of doing it down Laos but got sidetracked with everything else I wanted to do. I could definitely give it a whirl in Borneo…but of course with someone skilled at fixing flats and other mishaps. That sort of thing has never been my strong point -p Reply Andrew says 03/27/2017 at 244 am Had a terrific week touring Laos with my brother and four mates a couple of years ago as part of an organised dirt bike tour with Remoteasia. Brother broke his leg before leaving the capital of Vientiane and had to go to hospital in Thailand. The rest of us carried on. Reply Ira says 06/27/2013 at 1200 am Wow! The pictures were so good! I’d like to make it there one day! Reply Nazrul says 12/24/2013 at 352 am Hey Kristin May I know the name of that beach & location and which direction you took from KK to get there? Going to KK this Friday as a bestman and looking to ride after the ceremonies. Thanks a lot. Reply Kristin says 12/25/2013 at 1041 pm Hey Nazrul the beach is called the tip of Borneo and you want to head in the direction of Kudat.

Maputo is Not as Bad as They Say 01/25/2016 by Kristin 19 Comments Remember at the beginning of November when I was about to board a plane and go to Mozambique in Southern Africa by myself? Remember how fewer than two weeks before I was set to depart the person I was meant to meet up with for the trip cancelled on me? Another girl had floated into his life and he followed his heart – which meant he stayed in South Africa with her and told me he had to cancel our plans. Though disappointed I wasn’t angry with him but I was scared of what lay ahead of me. I worried about what a place like Mozambique would hold considering I couldn’t find any information at all online about traveling there as a solo female except for some terrible advice on a SCUBA message board that made my blood boil I couldn’t believe that everyone was trying to talk her out of going to Mozambique alone. I mean first of all Zimbabwe isn’t Mozambique and second of all it hasn’t been ‘Rhodesia’ since Jimmy Carter was in office. That was all that I found on the topic of solo female travel in Mozambique apart from an account of a woman who was robbed there so while a little fearful of what laid ahead of me I still packed up and went because I wasn’t about to let a guy end my trip before it even started. I know how to stay safe when I travel right? I decided I’d handle things in the same way as I did when I first started traveling and that I wanted to get back to the soul of being on the road – like couchsurfing with locals during my short time in South Africa and that way I’d be able to get some local suggestions for Mozambique before I took off. I found a host who had a house in Johannesburg full of PhD and medical students who were all about to graduate. He said I was welcome to stay as long as I liked and once I landed and made my way there they welcomed me immediately and invited me up to one of the lookout points in the city for the sunset. It all came full circle as I had done the very same thing on my first day in South Africa back in January with a sunset from a peaceful vantage point so my body was hardly able to comprehend where it was. Welcome back to Joburg Later that night we had an impromptu rain dance there’s a drought in South Africa at the moment. The whole house got into it. I’m still not clear on how much it was in earnest and how much was just silly and playing around but I loved the fact that we were all dancing together laughing burning incense and making up moves to an 8-minute rain dance song on YouTube. It reminded me why from the beginning I’d principally sought travel like this – being new in a room where nobody knew me given a chance to learn so much about the local culture provided an opportunity to come into something existing and lasting as a guest and being able to reap the energy and carry a bit of it away with me. Over the next couple of days I obtained a Mozambican visa bought a bus ticket had a couple of BBQs and a pool day with my couchsurfing host then left on an early morning 10-hour bus bound for Maputo – the capital of Mozambique. I’d heard nothing but horror stories about the city and the border crossing. The police were rumored to be corrupt and everyone told me not to go out at night and to get out of the city as quickly as possible. I’d also been told that it was likely I’d have to pay bribes at the border so when I arrived I was ready for a challenge. I felt a bit like a video game character advancing a level with each officer who reached out his hand for my passport and asked questions wondering if he’d be the one to ask for money. You’re from California! The Sunshine State.” Nah that’s Florida California is the Golden State sir” I replied making eye contact the entire time my back completely straight. He let me pass.” Next up an officer with a man polishing his shoes gave me a sly smile and flipped through the pages of my fat and fraying passport. The person just ahead of me had a crumpled up rand note ready to go. I was too focused to see if he had to hand it over or not. America. Obama! I want to go there!” the officer said handing my passport back. Another one passed. Finally the last officer with a giant scar near his eye took my passport just as I was about to slink by unnoticed. America! Chicago!” he said. No Los Angeles” I replied to no recognition on his face. California?” I ventured. Still nothing. I only know Hollywood” he replied sheepish. Yes California” I smiled. I could tell he wasn’t used to being corrected and he’d gone from appearing the most eager and likely to ask for a bribe to just wanting me to walk away. He then handed my passport back over and wished me a good time in Mozambique. Most of the land crossings I’ve experienced in Africa are the same hot incredibly dusty and dirty and crawling with hawkers trying to sell everything from SIM cards to a horrible exchange rate for some US dollars. Cars trucks and buses funnel through as the foot traffic weaves to the sides and through the middle forming a line for a stamp into the next place. A new horizon a fresh adventure. I boarded the bus again and sat myself next to a Portuguese woman. She was petite wearing dark jeans in the insane summer heat and stared pensively out the window in between nodding off to sleep and reading. Her dark curly hair grazed her large black-framed glasses and I figured she’d be an artist which was true. We started talking and I expressed to her that I was worried about Maputo and she wrinkled her brows and said give it a chance and I think you’ll find that there’s a soul to it.” I stepped off the bus after the better part of 10 hours which weren’t all that bad for some reason my ability to sleep anywhere at any time perhaps? to a taxi driver greeting me and promising that he was from my hostel Fatima’s. I was skeptical but what options did I have? So I went along. He tried to charge me nearly $8 for the 2km ride which I knew was way too expensive. He gave me the upper hand when he took my bag out of the trunk and handed it over before I paid so I asked him to kindly wait a moment while I grabbed the hostel manager who talked him down to the standard rate of $4. My years of traveling have served me well. Maputo by Hansueli Krapf via Creative Commons I didn’t take my camera out in Maputo for safety reasons After checking into the hostel sweaty and tired a tall dark-haired Brazilian man previously sitting at his computer with headphones on came over and handed me a coffee. You look like you could use this” he said with a smile. Later that night he and a local hostel employee invited my dormmate a tall blonde 18-year old English girl named Ella who had just started her solo travels and in Mozambique of all places and me out to an art gallery party Nucleo de Arte if you’re interested. Remembering what the Portuguese woman had told me I accepted and so did Ella. What unfolded was easily one of the best dance parties I’ve ever been to. Contrary to what I’d heard about Maputo everyone there was dressed nicely spoke English well and appeared far more polished than I was in my comfy shorts and loose shirt. The art was impressive and so was the music. The sound system was shockingly good and the locals tended to form circles each doing a dance that she or he had clearly perfected for years – it was each person’s individual move and the competition was fierce. The Afro-house music blasted until after midnight and I tried to forget about my 4am bus departure the next morning. In the midst of the good energy and beats that’s when you find a dance move you never had in you before and an appreciation for something you never realized you’d always yearned for. It nestles itself right into your heart where it will probably prod you forever – this night this place this feeling. I realized that night that I was happy to be on the trip alone as I’d opened myself up to serendipity. That’s the thing about solo travel because otherwise the most important person in the room is missing The real you. It’s the person you are when nobody you know is around to influence you. I always say traveling doesn’t change you but rather allows you to truly be who you’ve always been. On that warm night with muddy feet and a smile from ear to ear I was me again.

Actually I’ve been fascinated by Mozambique for quite awhile but this makes me want to go more! I can’t imagine I’ll make it there in the next couple years but I’m excited for when I do. Personally I think in dangerous” locations solo travel is almost the best idea because you can focus all your attention on yourself. Actual dangerous places are another thing but places like most of Africa the Middle East South America etc. solo travel would be more rewarding Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1051 am I think it’s hard to say an entire country is ‘dangerous’ because if I think about the US there are places where you have to lock the door when you’re at home and some where you never lock your door and know all your neighbors. It’s just about behaving as tourists how we would in a big city back home. Would I walk around alone at night? No. Would I have my phone out all the time in less than savory neighborhoods? No. You’re right solo travel is super rewarding. Reply Jub says 01/26/2016 at 556 am Yay awesome story. Well told reminds me of Johnny Wards trip across to Libya he posted earlier. Border crossings can be interesting but aren’t thaaaaat bad 🙂 Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1048 am They result in a good story! Reply Brianna says 01/26/2016 at 623 am It’s always great to read about someone debunking the rumors about dangerous” places. Sure they can be dangerous but really not much more than a big city in the United States. It’s all about perception and using common sense. Good read! Can’t wait for more! Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1047 am That’s the thing. Big cities in the US can be just as bad or worse. Reply Laura says 01/26/2016 at 355 pm To be fair Maputo can actually be quite dangerous. While we were there with my boyfriend we stayed with a mozambican family for a week while waiting for my luggage that had been lost in transit. First day there we went for a walk around the city center” which is not at all in the center but by the water but that’s not the point. We got out of a mall my boyfriend asked for directions to go back to our hosts’ place taking a different path than the one we used he is portugese so langage was not an issue. We followed the directions got to the sports center / pool and saw that our host’s house was just on top of the hill about 200 meters away and there was a path going there. We started walking and about 20 meters down the paths we hear people yelling and see young people running towards us waving their arms. Turns out the path we were taking is notorious for being dangerous in Maputo even though nothing else around is dangerous and the teenagers who told us so elaborated by saying my boyfriend would have been beaten up and robbed and I’d have been raped apparently that had happened before it was confirmed by our hosts. Sooooo sure nothing happened to us so all’s good and we really enjoyed the month we spent in Mozambique especially Tofo where we stayed with another mozambican family but with a little less luck it easily could have like if my boyfriend hadn’t understood what the teenagers were saying. And the family we stayed with clearly felt Maputo was dangerous even compared to other big cities they’d been to and even for them.. Reply Kristin says 01/28/2016 at 1046 am For sure it can. I don’t mean to say it’s not and that people shouldn’t be cautious when they’re there. I just was led to believe that there were no redeeming qualities and I felt like I found a gem by attending that party and like Johannesburg which people also try to avoid because of its reputation there are cultural and artistic parts of both cities that make them amazing. It’s too bad that their reputation outshines the good things the produce. I found that Joburg had WAY more soul than Cape Town for example. Not that we’re talking about SA here but I find that most people who go to one go to the other and it’s my best example for comparison 🙂 Reply Hung Thai says 01/29/2016 at 1235 am Very cool story. You are very courageous indeed. I’m not too much of a fan of traveling into dangerous places” even though I know every city or country has its more shady parts and nicer parts. As long as you know where those places are and don’t wander into them you’d be fine. Thanks for helping shed a brighter light on a place that few would even consider going to. Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 229 am Trouble is I basically had no choice but to route through Maputo and spend the night there given my transport method. You can skip it and fly directly to Tofo but I wanted to go overland to show that it’s doable and I’m so glad that I did! Reply Chelsea says 01/29/2016 at 122 pm Kristin I loved this post! We should always be open to new experiences and give things a go. I’m so happy that you’re happy ❤️ Reply Kristin says 01/29/2016 at 354 pm Love you Chelsea! Love your blog too! Reply Rebecca says 02/15/2016 at 153 pm Awesome!! So glad it all worked out – and what fun! Reply Philip says 05/26/2017 at 248 am Hi Kristin I am a South African who visited Maputo last year October for the first time. I fully agree with your friend that Maputo has a soul. Hidden gems of beautiful colonial buildings in Baixa excellent food everywhere very art- and music-minded people. The train station is a truly magical place – it great condition and a absolute must see. Great nightlife. Although dirty the city is functional. But what I enjoyed most is that Maputo does not have the feeling that you get elsewhere in Africa that the colonial past is at odds with the African culture. In Maputo the Portuguese influence is very much part of the local African identity and people embrace that. It is therefore much more like Latin American than any other city in Africa with a colonial past. Most skilled people I met have strong connections to both Portugal and Brazil. I enjoyed my trip tremendously apart from been harassed by police twice for taking photos. The most negative part of Maputo most certainly is the police – most corrupt I have found on the African continent and one cannot be too careful. A tip is to walk around with little cash and a copy of your passport certified IN Mozambique. Leave your passport in your hotel safe. I tried to avoid them but it wasn’t always successful. But that did not take away the pleasure of being in Maputo and I will go back. Another gorgeously beautiful part of Mozambique is Namaacha. It is truly one of the most special places in Africa I have been too. Ornately beautiful down in stunning sorrounding perched on a hill overlooking Swaziland. Enjoy your solo travels – am going to Greece next. Reply Kristin says 05/29/2017 at 738 pm I agree that the police in Mozambique in particular are pretty awful to deal with. I love the way you describe the culture! Thanks for the tip on a new place to go as well. I’d love to return to Moz soon. Reply Tim Edmunds says 01/27/2019 at 215 am I’ve read ALL of your accounts on your trip to Mozambique. I’m very impressed with the way in which you handled it all. ‘J’ really deserves to be debollocked! What a fool. Anyway youve inspired me. I’m going to be traveling around the globe alone later on this year. Leaving London then going to Dubai Kenya South Africa Mozambique the Maldives Mumbai New Dheli Hong Kong Malasia Australia New Zealand Hawaii South America Los Angeles New York and back to good old Blighty. Thank you so very much. Tim. Reply Kristin says 01/27/2019 at 458 am Lol I’m glad you liked what you read and found it helpful! Everything works out in the end. J actually came back and apologized this summer. I never expected that and didn’t have hard feelings but better late than never! Reply GG says 05/10/2019 at 719 am What a great personal story and makes this site unique. This is one of your best writings too I felt like I was reading an excerpt from a great novel but it was all real! Way to show how solo female travelers shouldn’t shy away from these places. Glad J apologized but in the end it seems like it was fate as you got back to your solo roots and reminded yourself and all of us of how magical it can be plus in a country and city that has more to offer than many give credit for.

Tell me when you were a child learning the alphabet wasn’t Q always for ‘queen’ and X was for ‘xylophone’? And what was Z for? Z was for ‘Zebra’ wasn’t it? Geniuses at blending in Such was my conditioning as a child in suburban California dreaming of animals in Africa for as long as my memories go back even though I was a half a world away. But my imagination lived in Africa where E was for ‘elephant’ What a magical sight! …and L was for ‘lion’ It came so close to the safari vehicle! Look – she’s preggers. In the Serengeti a wonderland for safari holidays in Africa you can see them all in just a few hours. They’re wild free and doing what animals do. You might catch them in a kill running from point A to B eating swimming or in the heat of the day – sleeping. Cats doing what cats do There are giraffes taller and more intricately patterned than my imagination had previously allowed and hippos that showed me that no they’re not cuddly and cute they’re ferocious and deadly. Dun dun dun dun.. The leopards hang out in trees oblivious of or maybe just ambivalent towards their fame beauty and popularity. There’s probably no way this hasn’t already crossed your mind but yes Pumbaa from the Lion King is around as well crawling around on his knees looking for grubs. Part of the ‘ugly five’ That’s not all though. The Serengeti is also home to 2 million wildebeests 900000 Thomson’s gazelles and 300000 zebras as the dominant herds via the Unesco World Heritage site. The Serengeti is also hosts many other herbivores including 7000 elands 27000 topis 18000 hartebeests 70000 buffalos 4000 giraffes 15000 warthogs 3000 waterbucks 2700 elephants 500 hippopotamuses 200 black rhinoceroses 10 species of antelope and 10 species of primate.” That’s a boat load no more than a boat load of animals! And giraffes! Indeed the magic of the Serengeti is difficult to describe in words which is why you see me reduced to referencing children’s movies and songs. The landscape of vast plains and a scattered outcropping of rocks Kopjes  here and there that was originally formed by volcanic activity is vast and diverse like few places on the planet. When looking out at the Serengeti it’s easy to see why the Maasai who are the native inhabitants know it as ‘Siringitu’ – the place where the land moves on forever. The Serengeti region spans over 30000 square kilometers and encompasses the Serengeti National Park itself the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Maswa Game Reserve the Loliondo Grumeti and Ikorongo Controlled Areas as well as the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. How to Budget it The part I visited was the Serengeti National Park and some of the surrounding conservation areas sleeping just outside the park at the Simba Serengeti Lodge which is a tented lodge with a killer view. Perfect sundowner spot In the Serengeti as with all of Tanzania you can spend a metric ton of money on a safari or you can go the extreme budget route taking a local bus and skirting the outsides without going in or something in between. I opted for that something in between because I wasn’t about to go all the way to the Serengeti and not go in with a proper safari vehicle! My safari tent at Simba with a proper roof an outdoor shower which I LOVED bathtub and a view of the Serengeti While I’m a huge fan of doing things independently I’m traveling through East Africa at the moment with a couple of others who are self-driving in their 4×4 we ditched the truck for this adventure for a few reasons The roads are insanely bad in the Serengeti and we didn’t want to pop a tire you really want a guide with you who knows how to spot animals and the safari vehicles with the pop-up top are way better for viewing. What the safari vehicle looks like Once we got there we saw zero other self-drivers thereby confirming we’d made the right choice. Most people book a package including a full-board few nights at a lodge a safari vehicle with a driver and maybe even a bush flight into the park to save time and to have a killer view An overhead view of Lake Manyara during the bush flight. We saw some of the great migration from the air too! Safari packages can cost tens of thousands of dollars per person on the high end closer to several hundred dollars per day in the mid-range which is what Simba is and what I did and can be more like a day tour departing from Arusha if you’re on a tight budget but still want to enter the park. There’s no bush camping in the Serengeti as it’s a National Park but there are campsites with amenities. How to save money There are a few clever ways that you can spend less money during your trip such as staying on the outskirts of the Serengeti in the conservation areas for some of the trip. The park fees cost just over $70 per person per day at the time of this writing but the animals don’t know what is in the park and what isn’t and you’ll find just as many animals in the conservation areas and far fewer people. We took the truck out and saw a family of elephants crossing a river and then the road right in front of us escorting their two-month-old baby along the way. This was magical Many of the lodges such as the Simba Serengeti Lodge are located on the outskirts so you can still stay in the vicinity of the park see animals from your room I saw a giraffe! and hang out in the pool in the hot afternoons all enjoying the Serengeti without having to pay to be in it. Loved chilling in here during the day In the conservation area you can also get out of the vehicle when it’s safe of course and do things like a bush breakfast. Pretty cool having breakfast with zebras in the background You can also book during the low season which is right in the middle of the rainy season in April or before the great migration begins in January and February. This is known as the green season in the Serengeti when the dry and golden plains grasses turn more lush. It’s not always green You can get amazing lightning storms in the rainy season. This was taken at the end of February. Nearby areas worth exploring As mentioned earlier in the post there are several areas that make up the Serengeti and several other national parks nearby as well. The Ngorongoro Crater for example is famous for Black Rhino sightings and Lake Manyara National Park has beautiful flamingos. Tarangire National park also has plenty of wildlife from monkeys to elephants and all kinds of species in between. Swimming in the pool just on the outskirts of the park I saw a herd of male elephants walk by. Hey guys! Welcome to the pool party Spotting them from my room Most of the time when people come visit the Serengeti they book safaris in these neighboring parks as well. Might as well if you’ve come all the way to Tanzania right? All in all I spent about 10 days in the Serengeti National Park the crater and the surrounding areas. Each day I saw something different and wonderful including the big five buffalo lions leopard elephants and rhinos. The viewing platform at Tarangire Simba Lodge So if you’re going on a safari in the Serengeti and want to do it right with a mid-range budget get a few of your friends rent a big safari vehicle with a driver and hop around a few of the lodges to see it all. I like Simba for this because the price is right the food is really good and healthy the service is great the rooms are super clean and the beds are comfortable they have outdoor showers and I LOVE me an outdoor shower and they all have pools and nice views. At the Karatu Simba Lodge If you share the safari tented rooms share the car and enter the parks for one day each and spend the rest of the time on the outskirts you’ll see plenty spend less and still be comfortable and happy with the experience. I definitely was! Special for BMTM readers If you want to do it the way that I did Simba Portfolio Lodges is offering a 15% discount for BMTM readers! Just mention this post when you email info@simbalodges.com for a discount off the rack rate for the trip that I did and I’ve looked into it guys their lodges and drivers are priced right.

I’ve been trying to figure how to do Tanzania properly without handing over thousands of dollars to a tour company with mixed reviews. For those of us that won’t have a land cruiser waiting when we arrive how would you recommended getting from a major airport to the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater? Are there reliable transportation companies around? Reply Kristin says 03/14/2017 at 708 am You could fly into Arusha and get picked up there. If it’s not super expensive I’d probably do that. it’s a looooong bus ride from Dar es Salaam otherwise. Doable but not much fun. Reply Jess says 03/15/2017 at 926 am Thank you! I’m loving your Africa posts Reply Sarah says 03/13/2017 at 754 am Awesome article. Going on a safari is totally on my bucket list 🙂 what made you decide to do a safari in Tanzania? There seems to be so many amazing places to choose from. Reply Kristin says 03/14/2017 at 647 am I’ve gone on safaris in Namibia Botswana and Zambia as well and those were all wonderful but the Serengeti is so famous. They all have different things that you can see so for me this was a bucket list item. Reply Ylvalie says 03/14/2017 at 139 am Actually you can camp in the Serengeti – they have designated camp areas with bathrooms and little buildings for cooking and eating. We went with It started in Africa” which is very affordable and comes highly recommended. The guide and cook were absolutely smashing and i would go with them again in a heart beat. Also very competitive on price. Reply Kristin says 03/14/2017 at 642 am Good to know! I meant you can’t bush camp so you can’t go in and camp for free but I’m sure there are all kinds of options once you’re in the park and in a designated area. You still needed a guide and cook. Reply Scott says 03/25/2017 at 658 pm This was very helpful and is definitely something I’ve always wanted to do! Including the other places you’ve done do you have a favorite? Is it possible to do this kind of trip in those countries? How much of this trip would one need to set up for themselves vs Simba Lodges? And how many days would you recommend? Reply Kristin says 03/26/2017 at 618 am I really liked the Serengeti and Chobe in Botswana the best however I did not see cats or rhinos in Chobe. That’s on a river rather than in a vehicle so it’s different. I did 9 days but one week would totally work too if that’s what you have to work with or even a few days less. Honestly having a vehicle is a must so I’d start there. I’d also book it all together for ease and probably price as well. I’m a fan of doing things as independently as possible but Africa is just different with how difficult that can be. Reply Scott says 04/11/2017 at 738 pm Also how was the heat since you were in a tent which I’m assuming wasn’t air conditioned? Reply Kristin says 04/12/2017 at 330 am The temperature for most of my time in Tanzania was comfortable during the day and they actually provide a heated water bottle at night because it gets a little bit chilly but it was still tank top weather for me. Reply Gina McHugh says 07/24/2017 at 637 pm This was super helpful! My husband and I are planning to go in January. However its really hard to plan such a big trip without knowing the area. You mention grabbing a group” to share the guide and the truck but like I mention we are traveling alone. Is it common to meet people there Perhaps at the Simba Lodge looking to share a guide? Reply Kristin says 07/25/2017 at 849 pm You could ask Simba lodge when you book if it’s possible to join another group. I wouldn’t plan on finding people there. Reply Mariel says 09/13/2017 at 901 pm How to you go about finding the drivers to hire? Is there a site or place to find them? Reply Kristin says 09/14/2017 at 1112 am I went with Perfect Africa for the Ngorongoro Crater and I really liked them and Simba for the Serengeti. Reply Lynn says 12/31/2017 at 620 pm Hello thank you for this! I am planning a trip to Tanzania solo and I love the idea of doing this how you did it. Would you recommend first booking accommodations at the respective lodges then finding an operator? Do the lodges have any relationships with operators? I too would be coming solo but interested to find a group – do the lodges or operators help facilitate groups coming together? Thank you again! Your blog is wonderful for women traveling solo! Reply Kristin says 01/01/2018 at 145 pm The lodges and the operators do have relationships and they will book the hotels for you. Often they’re all owned by the same company. There may be ones that will look to pair you up with others. Otherwise you can try the Africa backpacking group on Facebook or join an actual tour 🙂 Reply Rahul says 01/07/2018 at 116 am Thank you for this absolutely wonderful blog post ! Pinned it already and going to look it up whenever I plan my trip to Tanzania. Best Rahul Reply Jean-Michel says 01/24/2018 at 1214 pm Kristin There are local busses” from which place to which place? Where you you rent a 4WD without driver? Company name? Did you rent a guide who knows how to spot animals”? If yes what operator? Thanks a lot regards Reply Kristin says 01/25/2018 at 323 am I thought our guide with African Horizons was excellent http//www.africanhorizons.com/ Reply Jesse Oakes says 03/11/2018 at 833 pm Hi Kristin. Love your site and we just booked at Simba on your recommendation . I wanted to ask any tips you might have on how long customs takes in Dar Es Salaam – we need to catch a FastJet to Mwanza after landing – and the best place to get a SIM card. I saw you mentioned Vodacom but where to buy? Also we could use recommendations about how to get to the Serengeti from Mwanza. Thanks!! Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 244 am There’s a tiny little stand outside the airport where you can buy a SIM. Ask around and people will point you in the right direction. It takes a bit of time to get the visa in your passport and that will all depend on how many staff are working how many people just landed and if their systems are up and running. It’s a tough question to answer. I’d leave a generous time buffer if you can. I was in a private car my friends owned to travel around but you can also as Simba to organize transport for you! Reply Rayanne says 04/20/2018 at 1045 am Hi Kristin I’m a bit confused. So basically you didn’t use a tour operator and stayed in the Serengeti Simba Lodge the entire time? How did you get to the lodge? I would be landing in Kilimanjoro Airport from my international flight. Also how did you do game drives? Who did you book that with? Thanks. Reply Kristin says 04/21/2018 at 826 am Simba provides all of the game drives and transport as well. Reply Ruth says 11/03/2018 at 135 am Hey! How much all up did it cost you for the 10 days? Did you see the migration? I’m trying to get pricing from Simba based on your recommendation here as it’s not on their website. Reply Kristin says 11/04/2018 at 1236 pm To be totally transparent I didn’t pay for it. I wasn’t there in migration season. Reply Marijke says 11/05/2018 at 104 am Hi Kristin could you give some recommendations of reliable local companies i could book my safari with? Which i can also find on tripadvisor safaris are so expensive until now i did not find a good one below 2500dollar for a 8day safari. Could you send me some concrete recommendations in order i can make it affordable? I have already read above comments. Reply Kristin says 11/05/2018 at 611 am I only did the one mentioned in this post so I can’t really recommend any others. You can always choose to camp instead and go with a G Adventures type of tour. Reply Marissa says 02/17/2019 at 447 pm Was the accommodations for Simba and the guide prebooked or did you book everything once you were already in Africa? Reply Kristin says 02/18/2019 at 1253 pm I would prebook. Reply Mark says 07/04/2019 at 303 pm Great Blog Kristin & some interesting points & tips. My wife & I have been looking into doing the Serengeti after doing a self drive around Kruger last year & yes you can hire a 4×4 drive yourself around going from camp to camp as long as you’ve pre booked your accommodation. Yes it’s not as easy as Kruger to organise but we’re getting there slowly but surely & not as cheap. We did 5 nights in Kruger with vehicle hire & accommodation for £385 not including flights as we were in Mozambique at the time & caught a bus over to South Africa. When we’ve finally organised it i’ll post some useful tips & contacts for others who wish to take this route to doing a safari. Reply Debbie Aman says 08/04/2019 at 1005 pm Where do suggest you go for your best chance at seeing Cheetahs while visiting Africa Reply Kristin says 08/05/2019 at 616 am Namibia has a few reserves like Africat.

Coming Face to Face With Blue Flames 08/09/2013 by Kristin 167 Comments Kawah Ijen was one of the most brilliant parts of my trip so far which is saying a lot considering that I have now logged about 8 months traveling all over Southeast Asia. It was also a challenge to do solo and independently of a tour as online information was scarce and Kawah Ijen is a little more off the beaten path. But I’m simply not a tour person. I almost always shy away from them because they cost more and take away from the local experience. Though it was definitely done with less ease I don’t regret my decision to do this independently for a second. Thankfully for you I’ve now done the legwork to find the information to make this a bit easier moving forward for the independent traveler. This is how to do Kawah Ijen without a tour Kawah Ijen can be accessed by either Banyuwangi or Bondowoso. If coming from Bali Banyuwangi might be more convenient while Bondowoso is more convenient for those coming from the west like Mt. Bromo or Surabaya. From the bus depot in Bondowoso a morning bus leaves daily bound for Sempol – the closest town to the volcano. Hire a bicycle taxi for a dollar or two to take you from your hotel to the bus depot. As for exact timing of the bus departure each morning it’s tough to say. I was told 7am 9am and 10am. Like traveling elsewhere in Indonesia departure time probably just varies. I arrived at 9am and waited for only 20 minutes. As soon as I pulled up at the bus station everyone knew exactly why I was there and pointed me to the correct bus. How nice of them. The ride up took around 2.5 hours as it made frequent stops for supplies. The cost was 35000 rupiah which I thought was a rip-off until running into a fellow independent traveler who was charged 50000 for the same ride the previous day. I turned left down the road from the bus stop in Sempol and walked the 1km to Arabica Homestay the intersection will have a sign advertising tourist information. I was honestly a little hesitant to stay there given the poor TripAdvisor reviews and after dealing with the very unfriendly staff that also tried to overcharge me for some noodles initially quoted 7500 then demanded 10000 I stand by my hesitancy. However since information was hard to come by I went with that. I have since found out that Campir Guesthouse closer to the trail entrance is another option. Hire an ojek motorbike taxi from the bus stop to get there for around 30000 rupiah – be sure to bargain. The unsung heros of Kawah Ijen sulfur mine workers carrying heavy loads of sulfur down the volcano several times per day Part of the risk of approaching this without a tour is the potential of the rooms being booked out by tours. In this scenario there are always homestay options. That said they can be overpriced for what they deliver so bargain hard on those as well. I found that they would often ask where I was from before quoting a price determining how much I could likely afford given my home country hint America is the WRONG answer. There are a couple of warungs small eateries in town that provide cheap food as well if you want to avoid costly guesthouse pricing for dinner. Viewing the Blue Flames and Catching Sunrise Don’t miss this! I’ve read online accounts and met plenty of tourists who didn’t see the blue flames or the sunrise. Absolutely don’t miss them! The volcano is beautiful but hiking in with the stars getting up close to the blue flames and viewing the truly stunning sunrise were what made this trip so wonderful and unique. Ask your guesthouse to organize an ojek driver for 1am 2am would probably also be alright although it would be pushing it. Cost should be anywhere from 40-60000 rupiah. Again bargain on this. The driver will drop you at the entrance where you will be approached by offers for guides. A guide really isn’t necessary as the path is obvious. Hiking in with the stars made it a really beautiful experience. The initial 1km was a steep climb but it evened out after that. Upon reaching the volcano crater a rocky and steep path leads down to the blue flames. Plenty of workers are already there preparing to carry down their first load of sulfur. Some will attempt to lead your way and will ask for a few thousand rupiah in exchange for guiding you. This may be worth it given their unique knowledge – especially if you’re amongst the first to arrive as I was. He’s here to help Blue flames!! Sulfur clouds and glowing blue Up close probably a little closer than is safe being honest to the blue flames Hike back up and farther along the crater rim after you have your fill of the blue flames. Locals can point out the way to you. View a stunning sunrise from the top of the crater. Upon climbing back down the masses of tour groups passed me by. They had really missed out. Save for a couple other tourists I almost had the sunrise vista and the blue flames all to myself. So this is what I passed by in the dark Upon reaching the end of the trail there were plenty of private busses and ojek drivers around. One can either catch a public bus back down to Bondowoso and then take a bus from the terminal onward from there to one’s next destination or organize transport with the private tour companies staying in your guesthouse to Bali at the end of your trek if that is your next desired spot. I ended up hiring an ojek to bring me back to Arabica where I slept departed around 1230pm for the public bus and waited at the stop. I was told it would arrive anytime between 1pm and 4pm. In the end I was offered a ride and ended up hitch-hiking back to Bondowoso but that’s a story for another time. Do Kawah Ijen and do it independently. It was an experience of a lifetime. You will need • Proper shoes – hiking shoes or at least running shoes • Travel Insurance – you’ll be hiking it’s dark ’nuff said that is an affiliate link to the company that I get my insurance through • Something to cover up with – it will be cold • A headlamp or flashlight torch is essential • A gas mask or at least surgical mask would be a huge help if you get close to the blue flames given the sulfuric gas.

Reply Yahn Singapore says 05/16/2016 at 143 am ok this is very late but just in case for future readers. Just say Papua New Guinea or any SEA island that they never heard before but westernised” the name keep the asian essence…or just create one. They are not geography masters you know. example Christmas Island Johor Bahru Malaysia” Reply Kristin says 05/16/2016 at 807 am Really? I look pretty western. I think I’ll try Zimbabwe next time. Reply yahn Singapore says 05/16/2016 at 1127 am I was with a french traveler and everywhere he went he would just say he was born in Malaysia…though he doesnt look one bit like a Malaysian. The locals bought his story…maybe he was with me an Asian. Or maybe that he could speak a little Bahasa. Steph @ 20 Years Hence says 08/11/2013 at 511 am Looks awesome and I think we’ll try to hit this on our way through Java at the end of our time in Indo. Your last post had me pining for Rinjani but I think we’ll save that for a return trip… this looks really cool & like a worthy substitution! Reply Rob says 08/11/2013 at 351 pm Wow and incredible photography. I spent 3 weeks in Bali and a week moving to Jakarta. Perhaps I need to spend more time in Indo. Reply Kristin says 08/12/2013 at 1211 pm Thanks Rob and yes you do. Reply Kristin says 08/14/2013 at 211 pm I’m so glad you’re finding them to be helpful. Honestly you could skip Bromo and just do Kawah Ijen if you want to avoid the cookie-cutter experience although I did find a way to do Bromo without the crowds as well in my most recent post. I even paid a little more for the Ojeks – about 90k RT. It pained me but it is definitely a seller’s market. Since everyone else does a tour you’ll probably find one guy at the base who is willing to take you back and they know that you aren’t going to want to walk the whole way. I fancy myself a pretty good haggler but Sempol is particularly scammy. It’s still way cheaper than a tour though and you can go in time to see the blue flames. Reply Katarina says 12/18/2013 at 905 pm Great guide! I plan on using this info for my trip in March. Two questions – how long was the ojek ride and also what was the hiking time from the entrance to the blue flames and then to the crater rim? Thanks! Reply Kristin says 12/18/2013 at 1048 pm Glad you found it helpful! The Ojek ride took maybe 15 minutes. The hiking time depends on the person but I want to say it took me an hour to an hour and a half to the crater which you do want to see when it’s still dark and then the climb to the top took maybe 20-30 minutes additional. Leave yourself plenty of time so you can linger at the crater if you want. I was down there for maybe an hour and still have plenty of time to get to the top. I will mention I hike a lot faster than most people and passed pretty much everyone else up on the climb up. Reply Erwin says 12/19/2013 at 457 am I definitely want to do a tour to Ijen now 😀 Do you think it is possible to cycle to Sempol from Bondowoso because that might save money Nice pictures! Reply Kristin says 12/20/2013 at 631 am Like on a bicycle? Would be pretty steep but an adventure for sure! An Ojek works but the public bus is cheapest. Reply Kharisma Bintang says 12/29/2013 at 420 am This information is very usefull. by the way i’ll take my first solo-journey in january 2014. Thankyou ! Reply ranselwisata says 02/19/2014 at 1228 am well it’s a shame. i live in east java but never been to kawah ijen. your post has encourage me to visit the crater. nice post btw.

We want to see ijen and baluran do you think its doable in 3 days? Thanks. Reply Kristin says 05/05/2014 at 101 am I’d pick one or the other.

I will be visiting Indonesia in August-2014 and hope to replicate your solo trek. Reply Kristin says 05/24/2014 at 1247 am Awesome. Have a great time. Reply Nyima says 05/30/2014 at 1043 pm Wow this is really awesome! Currently im planning to go to Yogya see Borobudur and the city itself then move to Surabaya – Probolinggo – Cemoro Lawang to see Mt. Bromo. Move on to Ijen and then spend another week in Bali. Your blog is super helpful! I have read the Lonely Planet Guide on this but there was an overload of information so that I initially left out Ijen but your photo’s have convinced me to go see it! So i have a few questions to boost my confindence a little. I am a girl travelling solo speaking only the real basics of Bahasa Indonesia. So far I have not really booked anything ahead do you think that is necessary in any case? For now Im only going to Yogya to see where it will take me. I plan to travel for about 2 weeks so I am not limited by time if I don’t get to see everything so be it I don’t want to rush. First I wanted to go by a tour but actually the idea of doing that solo makes it sound even more rediculous for some reason.. But travelling from Yogya to Cemoro Lawang it takes 5 hours by train from yogya to surabaya do you think its possible? And what would your recommendations be for my stays? I’ll arrive late in cemoro lawang if I can travel it all in 1 day. So the next day I can walk around get to know the area. Day 2 do the early morning walk up to ?? then the next day the Bromo crater itself and get to Bondowoso the same day? Is that doable? What are your recommendations for this? And how should I plan my days in Bondowoso? Last what do you think is the best way to get from Bodowoso to Bali? In Bali I would like to see Ubud Lovina Beach Kuta somehting like that. Maybe you have tips for this as well? So really sorry for all the questions!! I am just a little insecure of travelling on my own its my first travel whatsoever and also on my own what am I doint to myself 😉 Reply Kristin says 05/31/2014 at 300 am I did it all solo without a tour or booking anything at all ahead during high season but it wasn’t easy. If you have limited time you may prefer a tour though I like doing things independently. You can take an overnight bus/ferry combo to Bali from Bondowoso. Hope that helps! Reply yahn Singapore says 05/16/2016 at 1136 am Hi again So there isnt any straight public transport from Sempol to Banyuwangi? I have to go back to Bondowoso first then to Banyuwangi? Reply Kristin says 05/16/2016 at 224 pm That I don’t know. You can probably hire an ojek to take you if you don’t have a lot of stuff or a car. You can also ask around once you get there. Since that’s not how I went I don’t know. Reply Ankur says 06/08/2014 at 832 pm Hi Kristine Thanks for sharing the info… You are my star… I am planning to do Surabaya – Mt Bromo – Mt Ijen – Surabaya tour. I love traveling on budget. Can you provide rough idea of travel expense involved in commutation using local transport and home stays? Reply Kristin says 06/09/2014 at 431 am Local transport is super cheap. Under $2 for most rides. Accommodation ran $7-$15. Reply Jac @ tripinasia says 07/11/2014 at 102 am Hi Kristin Congrats for your post and pictures. It’s such a pity that I found your website only after we got back from Kawah Ijen. A truly amazing place. We went there in June 2014 and we’ve put the details about the transport and cost on our page if some of your readers are planning to go there. Also a few pictures of that amazing place. You can find them here http//www.tripinasia.com/en/kawah-ijen/ now I’m going to discover what other places you have visited in South East Asia!. Happy travelling! Jacques Reply Kristin says 07/11/2014 at 430 am Thanks Jacques. I found it all pretty cheap but if coming from Singapore you do have to consider flights of course. Reply Jac @ tripinasia says 07/11/2014 at 507 am Yes Kristin I agree. Especially if you do it without a tour and using the local transportation public buses. As always if you want to go faster and have more comfort the prices can go up to western standards”. Now to put things in perspective we saw miners getting paid for their load at the weight station. One of them had 80kg and showed us the receipt… He will get paid IDR 40.000 25 euros. Most of them do 2 rounds a day every other day. This means they earn 2.5 euros a day for risking their lives and breathing the sulfuric clouds for that… Poor men. All that to whiten sugar the sulfur is sold to a nearby factory to do that. Reply Kristin says 07/11/2014 at 910 am I didn’t realize it was for whitening sugar! I feel better for always going for raw or brown sugar now. I knew they got paid pretty much nothing for all of the stress they put their bodies through and the years they’re shaving off their lives with all of that inhalation. Reply Elodie says 07/21/2014 at 648 am Hi Kristin Came across this post completely randomly but would like to thank you as you’ve just helped me decide that we wouldn’t go through an expensive tour from Bali and do Ijen by ourselves instead. Had one question for you if you would be so kind as to answer it If we stay in Banyuwangi what time do you think we should leave the hotel to make sure we catch the blue fire and the sunrise? Would love to not book accommodation and try and stay closer to the trail entrance but as we’re in Indonesia bang in the middle of peak season and we have a tight schedule I feel more comfortable with knowing I have somewhere booked. Keeping in mind we’re sunday walkers” not regular trekkers although I do go up and down Montmartre every day but I doubt that counts haha Thanks so much and beautiful photos indeed. Elodie Reply Kristin says 07/21/2014 at 807 am You’d want to start the trek around 230am in order to see the flames and Banyuwagi is a few hours away so unfortunately unless you hire a jeep to take you up at midnight you’d need to stay nearer to the trail head. Reply Elodie says 07/21/2014 at 901 am thank you for this very prompt reply! Banyuwagi is out then I found a number for Catimor Homestay so will try and get through to them. Or to find somewhere in Licin which would be a bit closer I guess! thanks for the advice! Reply Kristin says 07/21/2014 at 1053 am Catimor is much closer to where you want to be. I know it’s a bit pricey but so would taking a jeep at that odd hour of the night be. Reply Katie says 08/02/2014 at 1043 pm Hi Kristin Really appreciate your reviews – they are just my type of travelling advice! Thank you so much for sharing. My sisters and I are planning on spending a week in Bali and a week in Java at the start of September. For Java we were planning on Yogyakarta and Mt. Bromo using your tour plan as a base. But I just read this review and am wondering if we should switch Mt. Bromo for Kawah Ijen. If you had to choose one or the other which would you do? Also have you visited Borobodur and Prambanan as well? If so did you prefer Bromo or the temples? Thanks for the help! Katie Reply Kristin says 08/03/2014 at 830 am Kawah Ijen was definitely a highlight of my entire trip so I would suggest that if you must pick one. The blue flames are just spectacular. I really regret that I ran out of time and didn’t get to see Borobodur. I have plans to return to Indonesia to see much of what I missed. Reply Anonymous says 08/06/2014 at 622 am Hi Kristin i intend to do my solo trip to both mt bromo n kawah ijen soon. Need ur help…how do i make my journey to kawah ijen from mt bromo? And in ur opinion best to go mt bromo 1st then ijen or the other way round? Btw i’ll be from surabaya. Thks! Reply Kristin says 08/06/2014 at 523 pm You should do Bromo first if you’re out of Surabaya. Take a bus from Cemoro Lawang to Probolinggo and from there to Bondowoso for Ijen Reply Renate @ Renates Travels says 09/01/2014 at 853 am This is truly AMAZING. I’ve never even heard of such blue flames. I’ve wanted to visit Indonesia for so long and it seems like I need to get my butt over there soon! Thanks for sharing! I’ll be sure to use all your tips and tricks for when I visit 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/02/2014 at 1041 pm Indonesia is a fabulous place! Reply Ankur says 09/03/2014 at 748 pm Inspired by your lovely pictures I did Kawah Ijen last month. This is a amazing place. I did some astro photgraphy and saw blue flames. Could not get clear view of full lake due to excessive smoke. Thanks for your efforts!! Reply Kristin says 09/03/2014 at 954 pm That’s wonderful! Thanks for letting me know! You have some great photos there. Reply Sascha says 09/24/2014 at 841 pm Dear Muse I’m coming from Surabaya and want to go on to Lombok after Ijen via Bali. Now I’m wondering can I go up the way you did and easily go back the other way to Banyuwangi? My interpretation of traveling independently includes just having hand luggage so I would fine walking a bit with all my belongings if in turn I can avoid detours and extra stops. Nice post BTW looking forward to reading your posts for my upcoming destinations. Reply Kristin says 09/24/2014 at 1006 pm You should have no problem doing that. You can hire an ojek to drive you in case you have trouble with the bus which can be pretty unreliable which is why I ended up hitchhiking. I also only had hand carry luggage so it made taking an ojek possible. Reply Arthur says 10/02/2014 at 915 pm Hey Kristin! Thanks for your blog I found much information there and the pictures are great! I’m planning to go to Surabaya in a few weeks with my girlfriend. We stay there for 4 days and we really want to see Mt Bromo. I understand we can do that on our own pretty easily but I’m wondering about visiting Kawa Ijen next. It seems great but I’ afraid the travelling time may be too long and tiring especially because we have to go back to Surabaya to take our plane on monday morning. If Ijen is too remote do you know of a good destination to go after Bromo before coming back to Surabaya? I’ve seen Malang is close to it but I’m not sure there’s much to see. Thanks for your help! Reply Kristin says 10/03/2014 at 301 am 4 days might be too short. Look into Jogyakarta. Reply Daphne says 11/07/2014 at 758 pm Hi Kristin Thank you so much for this! I am looking a Bali-Ijen-Sukamade-Bromo tour options and they are so expensive! Even more so for private tours. Would love to try this out solo and your post really encouraged me to go ahead with it. FIngers crossed that it will be a great experience for me too! <3 Reply Kristin says 11/09/2014 at 1155 am That’s wonderful Daphne! You can do it! Reply Riz says 11/20/2014 at 932 pm Stunning Photos! The blue flames are incredible. Just wow. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 11/21/2014 at 749 am Thank you! They were quite incredible. Reply Erika says 11/27/2014 at 748 am Kristin thanks so much for writing this! I’m about to head to Yogyakarta and have been hearing horror stories of the tours to Bromo and Ijen so it’s awesome to hear that it’s possible to visit both places as a woman traveling solo. The one thing I’ve been worried about has been safety. I’m not an experienced hiker I’m not traveling with a smartphone and I can’t speak Indonesian or Javanese and several locals have insistently told me that it’s not even safe to go to Bromo alone much less hike into Ijen in the middle of the night. Do you have any advice on how to stay safe? Thanks so much! Reply Kristin says 11/28/2014 at 624 am I don’t know why Bromo would be dangerous alone. There are fewer tourists at Kawah Ijen and I have to say that was much more of a struggle but that’s just because there was no information on how to do it independently back then. That’s why I insisted on figuring out how to do it without a tour. If you arrive at the start of the hike and you want a guide just for that however you can probably get a miner to show you the way down for very very cheap. Reply Greg says 12/02/2014 at 554 pm To see the blue flames instead of getting up at 1am is it possible to hike up in the afternoon and stay until after dark then walk back down in darkness? Reply Kristin says 12/03/2014 at 712 am Not entirely sure but I don’t see why not. Reply Avery says 12/17/2014 at 1228 am Hi there Kristin Your blog is extremely helpful im going to embark on my first solo trip and i want to make it memorable. I chanced upon your site and read up on both your post on Bromo and Ijen. So I am planning on going to mount Bromo first and then heading to Kawah Ijen. I understand that from Cemoro i would need to make my way back to Probolingo but im pretty lost on how to make my way to Ijen once i am back in Probolingo and i was just wondering if you could provide me with some tips and tricks on how i would make my way from Bromo to Kawah Ijen and how to survive my first solo trip! Also how did you converse with the locals at both places Bromo and Ijen Thanks so much for your amazing and i will definitely be following you more often for updates on your next trips!! Cheers! Reply Kristin says 12/17/2014 at 406 am Hi Avery. Glad you found it helpful! You can take a bus from Probolinnngo to Bondowoso. Tell the people who bring you down from Bromo that you want to go to the bus station not their private company. Insist you already have a ticket even though you don’t and only buy the ticket ON the bus not from a kiosk outside. It should cost something like $1.60. From there I spent the night in Bondowoso then took the public bus up to Ijen the next day and the directions to that are on the bottom of this post. Hope that helps and it works out! Reply Jenna @ Stoked for Saturday says 01/04/2015 at 1100 pm Hi Kristin! So glad I found your post! We’re just planning a trip to Bali and definitely want to hit up this blue lava volcano during our trip. How long is the hike up in the morning? We definitely want to catch sunrise but want to get a feel for how long the climb is so we have lots of time for photos 🙂 Thanks for all your tips it’s been super helpful in our planning!

I would love to visit kawah iljen for my solo travel to indonesia this year. However i have some apprehensions. Will it be safe to go out at night to see the blue flames on your own? given the fact that i’m a woman. Thanks Reply Kristin says 02/16/2015 at 501 am I did and I was fine. Reply Christine Grotjohn says 02/22/2015 at 311 am Thanks so much for your posts on Bromo and Ijen! I have two weeks to do Yogyakarta – Bomo/Ijen – Gilis – Ubed. I’m really on the fence and thinking about cutting out Bromo based on your anti-climactic” review of the top. I’m all about beautiful views from the top so if it’s worth it I’d keep it on my itinerary and cut a few days out of the Gilis. 1 For time sake do you suggest I cut it out or go for it? 2 For a cheap backpacker how much do you suggest I might budget a day for a 2 week trip? Thank you to the moon and back and blessings on your continued travels! Reply Kristin says 02/23/2015 at 148 am Hmm. I really liked the Gilis too. It just depends on whether you want beach time or mountain time. If I were choosing between Ijen and Bromo I’d say definitely Ijen if that helps. Indonesia is very cheap if you take public busses. You can easily do under $30/day although I have to ask how are you getting to Bali? Flying? Might be a good idea given your limited time because overland took a whole day for me with traffic and breakdowns. Reply Christine Grotjohn says 02/23/2015 at 613 am You’re a gem! I wanted to do at least one hike and get some beach time as well. I was planning on flying from Surabaya to Lombok after Ijen to get to the Gilis the fastest and then taking the slow boat back to mainland Bali to end in Ubud. Please do correct me if that’s not the wisest route or departure locations! Also wondering HOW cold it gets at the top for packing purposes. Would two long sleeve layers and a hoodie with hiking capris suffice and are tennis shoes ok verses my hiking boots I’m a runner so want to avoid brining two pairs of heavy/space consuming shoes? Thanks again! Reply Kristin says 02/23/2015 at 748 am Sounds like a good plan. You’ll wish for something long sleeved at least and I trekked the himalayas in running shoes so I see no issue with them! Most people looked at me like I was crazy though.

Reply Iain says 03/11/2015 at 1027 pm Hi Kristin Thanks for sharing all the great travel advice! My friends and I are planning on going to Kawah Ijen and mount Bromo. We are flying to Surabaya on a Friday morning and will need to leave Indonesia by the Monday mid-day. Do you think this is enough time to go from Surabaya to mount Bromo then onto Kawah Ijen? We don’t want to miss Kawah Ijen so should we start with it in case we run out of time? Thanks for your help! Reply Kristin says 03/13/2015 at 640 am I’m honestly not sure. If you took a tour you might be able to since the transport is private but if you’re relying on public transport you have to allow for huge delays so that’s why I wouldn’t want to say yes. Reply atyrah says 04/27/2015 at 919 am hai kristin thanks for sharing ur experience to kawah ijen.. i will go to surabaya on 4th may.. i will arrive at 9am at juanda airport.. i well aware that from surabaya to bondowoso will take around 4-5 hour.. n my question is.. do u know the last bus that will go to sempol?? or there is any other option to go there with reasonable pricecheap.. its there any tips for me to avoid scam? I’m travelling solo for this trip.. i really hope that u can give ur feed back.. thanks 🙂 Reply Kristin says 04/27/2015 at 1056 am I think the bus to sempol is just in the morning and maybe there is also one in the afternoon. You would probably have to stay outside of Sempol and take the bus in the morning however the schedule might have changed. Perhaps ask at the airport? Reply John says 05/05/2015 at 449 am Hi Kristin! Thanks for the amazingly detailed write-up and responses you’ve given to your readers! My friend and I are planning to visit Mt Bromo and Ijen without a tour this month from 12-17 May. Given that we are unaware of the ground conditions I was wondering if you could kindly help me to assess if our planned itinerary is feasible? 12th May Arrive at Surabaya Airport at 9pm. Stay overnight in Surabaya. 13th In the afternoon head to the bus station in Surabaya and take a bus to Probolinggo and then change to a small bus to Cemoro Lawang. Stay at Cemoro Lawang for the night. 14th Trek across the sea of sands and up to the crater of Mt Bromo. Explore the town. 15th Wake up at 3am to hike up to the viewpoint for the sunrise. Leave Cemoro Lawang by 930am take the bus to Probolinggo and then take the bus to Bondowoso. Is there time to head up to Ijen perhaps Sempol to stay for the night? 16th Wake up at 230am to see the blue flames. After that leave Ijen and head to Bali. 17th Catch the 9am flight from Bali back to Singapore Key concerns is there time to head up fr,Promotion

Hiking the Huemul Circuit The Toughest and Most Rewarding Hike in Patagonia 06/20/2016 by Kristin 56 Comments I stuck my arm out and latched onto a tree to prevent myself from careening down the trail. I caught it just in time as my body kept moving but the tree thankfully pulled me back like a puppet on a string. I’d been warned that this trail would be ridiculously difficult but it fell on deaf ears. In fact it only made me want to do it more. Standing there I thought They were right but I don’t want to admit it” while simultaneously wishing to myself that curling into a ball on the floor melting into a puddle and dripping down the rest of the trail was an option. I was in the middle of a 3-hour descent that was almost vertical on slippery dirt and without anything to hold onto. One false move would mean a serious injury. I’d never experienced anything like it before. This was NOT easy Yet I knew that going back up would be worse than continuing on. Then I’d just have to do the same thing in the other direction going back over the pass and to the 2-hour trail that was so narrow one wrong step would mean falling all the way down to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. There would be no walking out of that scenario. I really didn’t want to repeat it. I had no choice so I just kept going. I started wondering to myself why I was there. Was this actually even fun? Then the bushes cleared and I could see a glimmering lake with ice bergs floating in it. Nobody around for days it was ours – Steve who had hiked the Huemul circuit before a young German guy named Joachim whom we met along the trail and me. That view made me remember why I took on the challenge in the first place. A glacial lagoon that was ours That was on day three of one of the most difficult hikes I’ve done and yet somehow it’s mostly fond in my memories. It started out with some information Steve who trekked the Huemul Circuit three years ago I could NOT understand his motivation for doing it twice hadn’t bargained for. If you’re going to want to do this trek you need a harness and carabiner to rappel across the rivers.” Steve had just forded the river last time. Yes he had forded the freezing river that was coming down from a glacier. And then just hiked in freezing wet pants afterwards. I liked the idea of the harness much better. We had to rent these in town and carry them to duration of the trek and so will you. You see when Steve had been there previously the metal wire with the pulley was broken. By the time we arrived it had been fixed again. I have no idea how often this thing breaks and certainly didn’t let myself contemplate it too much while actually on it. The first rappel of two on the trek Why in the world did we want to do this? We’d gone from rural areas without many if any other western tourists on the Carretera Austral to the much more popular and crowded El Chaltén and we wanted solitude again. This circuit is difficult and technical enough to keep most people away and it’s one of the only trails in Patagonia that you can see the Southern Patagonian Ice Field from. It’s also possible to get sunrise at the glacial lagoon all to yourself. Seriously with nobody else there. The Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This is one of the best views I saw in Patagonia. So amazing The challenges Most of the trail is not marked download the Argentina map on the maps.me app before you go to help with navigating three hours of the trail is almost straight down and you must carry absolutely everything you will need on the trek and I mean everything including a carabiner and harness that you can rent from shops in town. The only thing you don’t need to bring is water. Day One Day one was rather pleasant. We left in the late morning and took it easy checking in with the ranger office registering they’ll send out search and rescue if you go missing and heading out on our way. It was an easy hike from the town of El Chaltén through a bit of forest and a bit of open areas. There were sweeping mountain views and a casual glacier here there and everywhere. Photo by Steve At the end of that day it was seeming pretty easy. There were about 6 other tents all around and we cooked some pasta. Steve somehow managed to find it funny rather than annoying when I knocked down the boiled water twice trying to turn off the flame. Day Two For most day two there’s no trail. The second day involves strapping on a harness first thing in the morning and pulling yourself across the wire rope. It’s much easier without a backpack on so send that across first to your hiking buddy. The next few hours will be spent climbing over a rocky glacier moraine then climbing hand and foot up a gravel trail for 1000 meters. Well that’s a nice reward It will be a challenge for sure. This is easily one of the steepest trails I’ve done and I was VERY glad to have had walking sticks with that steepness. Thankfully the view is amazing during this part of the trail. To your right there will be two big glaciers and at the top you’ll have the view of the Ice Field at the Paso Viento. A close up of the peaks The Paso Viento is so-named for normally being ridiculously windy. In Patagonia when something is characterized as ‘windy’ it does not mean a stiff breeze it means wind pelting you so hard that it picks you right up off your feet and slams you into a rock if it wants to. That day however there was no wind whatsoever. It was a clear day and we could see straight onto the ice field and beyond. Sitting with Joachim at the top In that moment I was staring at a part of planet Earth that is still very much uncharted territory. Maybe I’m not the one out exploring and mapping it out but I sure was content in that moment to be the only girl sitting there looking at it. That night after a steep descent down we slept under some incredible stars next to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. A group of five others showed up as well but that was it. Otherwise we were the only humans out there for days. Gorgeous night shot by Steve Day Three Day three was the long and very tough one that I mentioned in the intro of this post. The beginning was more or less fine. We woke up with the sun and packed up quickly aware that it was a long day until we got to the glacier lagoon. We picked a few Calafate berries along the way and readied for the tough part. Picking berries The trail narrowed to the point that one false step would mean falling down all the way to the ice field. I was very aware that wasn’t something anyone would be walking out of. Then we had another pass to climb up and over -the Huemul Pass. The wind picked up but it was in my favor and started to actually push me up the trail much to my gratitude. Once I reached the top I could finally see the glacial lake. Like much of the water in Patagonia the minerals made it an intense aquamarine coupled by the crystal clear water from the glacier. Before the descent from hell I’ve already waxed poetic on the descent thereafter earlier in the post but suffice to say it was steeper than anything I’ve ever tried and to add insult to injury the plants poked and scratched me the whole way down. Patagonia ain’t for pansies. The downhill see that loose dirt? That night we settled into a campground right on the water as the rain started to fall and the wind picked up. We found a tree to hide behind for cooking and finally tucked into the small bottle of whiskey we’d brought along taking chunks of the ice out of the water because wouldn’t you want some 10000-year-old glacial ice in your beverage? In the morning we’d see the sunrise reflect on the ice bergs floating in the water and it would be glorious. Day Four The morning was peaceful and so many shades of gold and red and unlike my experience in Iceland where there were a good 25-40 people we were the only ones to see it. Seriously we were the only people there! The ‘bergs floating around at the Viedma glacier Yep wow The hike out from there was more like the first day’s – it wasn’t too challenging though it was long at 18km and by the time we reached the end pulling ourselves across another pulley again we were absolutely exhausted. The thing is at this point you have to try to find a bus. The busses coincide with incoming tourist boats that visit the glacier in the late morning and afternoon. Hitchhiking is also an option which is what we did. An American tourist who had summited Everest twice gave us a lift congratulating us for completing such a tough circuit. It paled in comparison to what he’d done of course but I still felt happy to have taken on this challenge and dominated it even though at times I didn’t think I could.

Reply Rika | Cubicle Throwdown says 06/21/2016 at 243 pm Absolutely stunning scenery but that hike looks really tough! I’m content to sit back and look at your photos 🙂 Reply Kassie says 06/21/2016 at 702 pm These photos are amazing ? Not sure I would brave that hike but it definitely seems like it was worth it! Reply Ijana says 06/21/2016 at 840 pm Hey I haven’t read your blog in awhile cause a trip got me out of the habit but what a great post to come back to! I’m a sucker for everything to do with hiking and this is going on my list of hikes I absolutely must complete one day. The challenge is what makes it so rewarding not to mention the beautiful views and the nature and the solitude 😀 Reply Kristin says 06/23/2016 at 414 am Welcome back! totally agree that the challenge sometimes is what attracts me in the first place. Reply Paul Taylor says 06/22/2016 at 559 am Hey Kristin you are really a good writer. I am glad to find your website and this post was amazing. I am bookmarking your site now so i will not miss your posts in future. Cheers! Reply Brianna says 06/22/2016 at 949 am Damn girl. I was holding my breath as I did this trek along with you through your writing. You’re a beast. Reply Simone says 06/23/2016 at 1212 am Wow it sounds incredible! But definitely not for the light hearted 🙂 I know from experience that photos are hard to compare to the real thing especially when it comes to showing a gradient but that hill photo genuinely looks intimidating! Reply Kristin says 06/23/2016 at 355 am Nope anyone who hates heights or isn’t all that into hiking would have hated this hike! I almost hated it myself but oh man that view and the lack of crowds really made it cool. Reply Austin says 09/04/2016 at 928 am Really wanting to do this hike what month did yal do the hike? And did yal hike it clockwise or counter clockwise? Reply Kristin says 09/07/2016 at 1001 am Started from town and went clockwise. I cannot imagine really doing it counterclockwise. Reply John says 11/10/2016 at 618 pm Hi Kristin Enjoyed reading your report of the the Huemul Circuit trekking where I am planning to do next month. I do have a question about the hiking direction. From the map if one started hiking from town I think one must be doing counterclockwise. Am I missing something? Reply Kristin says 11/11/2016 at 1046 am You want to head for the Paso del Viento right after you register at the ranger station. They can help further clarify for you but there’s no way I can imagine going uphill on what would normally be the 3rd day. The downhill was scary but uphill would be almost impossible…it’s a super steep decline/incline Reply Carlos says 09/06/2016 at 923 am Hi Kristin! Thanks a lot for this post. It provides some very good info about this circuit which I’ve wanted to do ever since I saw it on Steve’s blog. I have a couple of questions that perhaps you can help me answering. 1 How difficult it is to find the path in the unmarked sections? I’ve downloaded a GPX file from http//www.wikiexplora.com/index.php/Circuito_Cerro_Huemul and I’ve installed it into a Garmin GPSMAP 64s and I plan to buy a paper map in El Chaltén as well. 2 Did you have to ford any rivers or were you able to use harnesses for all of them? 3 How cold were the nights inside your tent and sleeping bag? What kind of clothing did you wear to keep you warm while sleeping? 4 Perhaps this is the most important one. We’re not the fittest trekkers. We do hike regularly I do 5km 150m elevation gain and loss as training about 3 times per week for example but that doesn’t mean we’re thin. We’re obviously in better shape and have better training than most people but you seem to be quite fit. Do you think we would have a horrible time on this circuit? I can deal with being tired exhausted and wishing the climb to be over but I think that I can deal with a 900m elevation gain although I might be slow. Thanks a lot! Reply Kristin says 09/07/2016 at 254 pm 1 Sometimes you won’t be able to see the path at all that’s why I think having an offline map with plotted points on it with a GPS is important if not essential. Always look for the rock stacks to lead your way as well 2 We just had to cross two and used the harness for both 3 It’s more important to have a good sleeping bag than clothing for sleeping. More layers of clothing actually make the bag less effective. Go for one with a comfort level below 0 for sure. You’re sleeping next to the ice field! 4 I can’t say it’s not hard but it’s not about being thin it’s about being able to take on the challenge and having knees that can handle that intense downhill part. I feel like uphill is mental downhill is knees. Reply cath says 12/16/2016 at 433 pm What an amazing adventure. I think a bit too challengin for our family. I am wondering about doing only the last day back and forth. Would love to knoew what you think of that? Reply Kristin says 12/16/2016 at 753 pm That would also be beautiful! You could see the glacier lagoon. Budget all day for it since it’s out and back. Reply Aura says 10/30/2019 at 156 pm Hello this seem exactly what I am looking for. I ve been looking for a challenging trek for ages. What other similar treks do you recommend anywhere in the world? I ve done gr20 and that was awesome. Reply Kristin says 10/30/2019 at 300 pm Wrangell St. Elias in Alaska has some great backcountry options. Crossing glaciers lots of steep moraine though. hard on the knees! Reply Alfy says 01/02/2017 at 102 am Hey great post! Do you think Huemul circuit is possible alone? Reply Kristin says 01/02/2017 at 1053 am I met someone on the trail who asked if he could join us and of course we said yes. He’d done the first day solo but that’s an easy day. Hiking alone is never a good idea especially considering day two is over a glacier moraine and it would be pretty easy to fall and never get found. I’d stay in a social hostel and try to find some people to join. It’s a tricky trail and much of it isn’t even visible requiring a GPS and a harness to get across two rivers. It’s of course possible to do alone but not very smart. Reply John Sullivan says 01/22/2017 at 648 pm I ended up doing this trail because of this blog post! Thank you so much for posting about it Kristin! It was freaking the most difficult thing I’ve ever done in my life haha. Was actually my first time doing a multi-day trek I had the physical fitness but at times during the hike I was asking what have I gotten myself into and why did I have to discover your blog post =P but no the hike was just phenomenal. I was lucky to do it with someone more experienced and doing the hike certainly made me slightly more experienced. Honestly seeing your picture of the Southern Patagonian Ice Fields sold me and it was the most humbling thing of nature I have ever seen in my life. I actually met a few other people while backpacking last month who had also found out about and ended up doing this this trail because of this particular post. And then I ended up telling 3 more people about it who ended up doing it. The domino effect of one blog post is quite interesting. Hopefully many people who are able to do the trek find out about it APN doesn’t seem to advertise it so much given how much can go wrong with the weather but otherwise it’s an amazing trek. Thanks for posting about it and sharing your experiences! Reply Kristin says 01/23/2017 at 1035 am Whoa this was your first multi-day trek? Way to start with a bang! That’s the reason to go – that view of the Southern Patagonian Ice field. It’s just mind blowing. I can understand why they don’t advertise the trek much. I can imagine search and rescue could have their hands full if they don’t make the trail clearer and especially that downhill and the glacier moraine. What an experience though! Reply John Sullivan says 01/23/2017 at 231 pm Agreed the ice field view is just mind-blowing literally with all the wind we had up at Paso del VIento though seems like you had little. But even the other parts of the hike are beautiful especially considering it’s so seldom traveled. I did Torres del Paine about a week later solo and honestly wasn’t phased by it after doing the Huemul even though it was only my 2nd ever multi-day trek–a good way to be thrown into the fire. Yea apparently that downhill section has you go down vertically 500m over 1.2km horizontally or about 42% decline. Even with hiking poles it’s ridiculously difficult. And yeaaaa we heard of a guy who got his foot stuck in one part of the glacier but at least he was with friends and they were able to take him back. Then we met some freak-of-nature Swiss guy who left Chalten at 7 AM and made it to Refugio Paso del Viento by 4 PM without even registering to do the hike. Definitely a memorable hike! Reply Ashton says 08/01/2017 at 621 pm Kristin Thank you for posting in such candid detail about your hikes. Your travels are inspiring to female travelers like myself. What time of the year did you hike the Huemul Circuit if you don’t mind me asking? Reply Kristin says 08/02/2017 at 909 am This was in March. I think it’s probably only doable without snow 🙂 Reply Mike says 08/29/2017 at 1043 am Hi Kristin This sounds like a pretty tough hike. Do you think it could be done in 3 or even 2 days? Mike Reply Kristin says 09/04/2017 at 824 pm Not in 2 days unless you’re the type who can do an ironman without breaking a sweat. I guess three would be doable but I’d personally be miserable trying to do it that way. Reply John says 11/01/2017 at 114 pm Hi Mike it can definitely be done in 3 days which would be a challenge. Two days is also very much feasible but you would be hurting by the end. The record for doing it is 17 hours but two people from the UK The Tempest Two who seem like they’re very fit and trained a lot before doing it. If you were to do it in 2 days you’d leave from El Chalten and go all the way to Paso del Viento in one day before going to the hut. It’ll be a long day. The next day you’d go from the Paso del Viento Hut back to El Chalten. This would be at least 36km/22 miles. I did this one year ago and it was extremely challenging. If you really want to do it quickly I’d recommend 3 days go from El Chalten to Paso del VIento in one day and then do after that do the hike as per usual. You can look at the video here where the people do the same thing https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqpFR2KL8A Reply Alex says 11/13/2017 at 1119 am Hi Kristin Your blog really has reached a lot of people. I am planning on doing the Huemul circuit as a result of reading your blog! I am wondering if you can give some extra pointers for people that might be interested in doing this trek Do people need to bring a harness/carabiner or will they be available in order to cross the river? Are there designated camping grounds to stay at? Where did you camp while you were doing this circuit? Reply Kristin says 11/13/2017 at 1243 pm Hi Alex Thanks for asking I thought I’d mentioned that in the post but I just re-read and I hadn’t! added now you have to bring your own harness and carabiner which you can rent in town. There are designated areas to camp but there are not any facilities. You’ll see spots marked by rocks where you can pitch a tent as you progress. Hope that helps! Reply Margaret says 11/26/2017 at 746 pm Hey Kristin! Your blog is awesome and super helpful! My boyfriend and I are doing the Huemel Circuit as well as the Circuit Torre and Fitz Roy. Do you know if we need to book camp sites ahead of time and what websites we would use? Thanks in advance! Reply Kristin says 11/26/2017 at 1142 pm Depends on when you’re going for Torres del Paine. In high season yes and I believe you’d need to do that with the owners of the various campsites – Fantastico Sur and Vertice Patagonia – online ahead of time. The free ones you’d book with CONAF. For the Huemul Circuit there aren’t really maintained sites. They are just piles of rocks and sometimes little sheds that you’ll see along the way. And Fitz Roy can be done in a day from El Chalten so no need to spend the night unless you want to and I think for that you can just show up. Reply Leah says 01/19/2018 at 952 am Kristin Thank you for posting this guide! It’s hard to find many details online. I just completed the O Circuit in Torres Del Paine and I’m hoping to start this one on Tuesday with some friends I made on the O. I’m definitely a little worried about that descent and the river crossings but hopefully it will all be ok 🙂 Reply Kristin says 01/21/2018 at 332 am It’s so beautiful. You’ll really feel like you’ve earned it! Reply Sarah says 04/17/2018 at 454 pm Hi Kristin Thanks for all of the information. Your info on Argentina/Chile including this trek is incredibly helpful. We are debating hiring a guide for the Huemul Circuit only if for the navigation assistance & help with the zip-line type river crossings. That being said guided trips are quite expensive & we are normally pretty independent with our trips so debating going without the guide. I’ve read in other places that navigation is not too difficult with the use of a good map & experience w/navigation. I’ve also seen that it is possible to ford the first river crossing as long as the water levels are low instead of using the zip line system. We are experienced hikers but the river crossings looked a bit intimidating to me! Is it easy to understand the harness/carabiner system across the river & did you feel safe with the crossing? Also where did you end up renting this equipment? Thank you. Reply Kristin says 04/21/2018 at 841 am So even if you ford the first river you’ll need to pull yourself across the second one. Plus you’ll be freezing and soaked in glacial water up to your waist. It was easy enough for us to figure out how to use it and you can just go into the shops around town that sell and rent equipment and see who has them. We had to visit a couple to find someone who had harnesses. It’s definitely possible to lose the route as you go. The best thing you can do is bring a waterproof map and also plot the route out ahead of time on maps.me and track via GPS. Or if you want to bring a guide you won’t have to worry about any of those things. I felt fine without one. Hope that helps! Reply Myles says 05/11/2018 at 954 am To see the Southern Ice Field do you have to take the paths that take you across the rivers with harnesses? I’m doing a trip in winter there late June to be exact and I would like to be able to see the Ice Field but know that specific trail isnt an option that time of year. Any advice on what to do for winter? We’re looking at Cerro Torre and Fitz Roy/Laguna de los tres. Thanks! Reply Kristin says 05/13/2018 at 1019 am Yes you do have to cross the rivers with harnesses. However even in April of this year I heard that the path was already completely snowed in and impassable. Same might be true of Cerro Torre and Fitz Roy. You’ll have to see how the snowfall has been when you arrive I’m afraid. Reply Karen says 09/05/2018 at 610 am Hello! We are planning on doing the Huemel circuit just after Christmas this year and I’m very glad I came across this post. I have a question how did you manage the steep descent? It looks like in one of your photos you are holding onto some rope? IS that for the very steep descent you mention? If not how did you get down it? I’m very pleased you posted what you saw on your trip as now I know what we’ll see and am very pleased we are doing this trek! Reply Kristin says 09/06/2018 at 104 pm That rope is only present on that one part. Otherwise there’s no real tactic other than using hiking poles. The descent was really hard for me and I genuinely did not enjoy it. It took about 3 hours of straight downward hiking on loose dirt. I think this is why most people don’t attempt this hike and there are so few others on the trail though! Reply David Reynolds says 09/09/2018 at 634 pm Hello Kristen Myself and two other guys are doing the Huemul in early October. What time of year have you done this hike? Any tips for October weather down there? Also just curious but what was your pack weight starting out? And did you all have crampons going across the glacier? If so what kind did you have? And is there a way to not go across the glacier with the potential of falling through? Thanks! Great photos and story! Reply Kristin says 09/09/2018 at 715 pm Hey David there is no glacier crossing so you don’t need crampons but you do need a harness. I went in March. I’m not sure about October as there might still be snow. It depends on the year I’m sure. Reply Val says 10/05/2018 at 438 pm Hey David when in October are you going? I might be Keen. Reply Ender says 11/20/2018 at 1024 am By any chance do you have gps route tracks that I can download on the google maps. Thnks. Reply Kristin says 11/21/2018 at 1206 am I don’t anymore but we tracked on maps.me Reply bibo says 09/18/2019 at 622 am did it last year  fucking hard!!!this wind — at the end its rewarding but FUCKING HARD! Reply Kristin says 09/18/2019 at 327 pm LOL agreed Reply Mico says 11/11/2019 at 1251 pm I really liked reading your post. It seems like an excellent adventure. I am planning to do the circuit in December 2019 9.12-12.12. I hope I find some fellow hikers for the trail or if somebody reading this would like to join me Reply Anna says 01/26/2020 at 639 pm This is helpful! Do you know if we can rent other gear when in El Chalten? Like sleeping bags sleeping pads and a tent? Just thinking about maybe saving some space for traveling and renting those items if it is possible. Reply Kristin says 01/27/2020 at 831 am Yes you can. I rented in Peru once and regretted it when my tent leaked – even if you assemble it before renting you don’t really know if there’s a small leak – but it’s not out of the question! Reply Anna says 02/10/2020 at 136 pm Great thanks Kristin! Have you heard anything about the quality of the gear you can rent in El Chalten? I have those same concerns leaky tent cold sleeping bag etc….. Do you know if the gear is generally trustworthy or not? Reply Kristin says 02/13/2020 at 1034 am That I don’t know. I noticed last time I was there that the tents they were renting out would perform badly in wind which is SO common in Patagonia.

Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner As the birthplace of free climbing Saxon Switzerland National Park offers a climbing environment that is second to none. A total of 1106 free-standing sandstone peaks make this area in Saxony the most varied outdoor climbing location in Germany. And with 21000 different climbing routes to choose from theres every chance youll have the rock face to yourself. But if youre not yet ready to scale the rocky crags you can learn the art of climbing at a local climbing school. Sustainable nature conservation The climbing regulations enforced in the Saxony region show that recreational climbing and nature conservation do not have to be mutually exclusive. They ensure that this natural climbing paradise is not subjected to any damage and prohibit anything that takes the place of strength or skill or that puts undue strain on the soft rock. A unique landscape to explore at your own pace This rocky national park is also considered one of the most spectacular walking regions in Europe. The 112 kilometres of the Painters Way for example offer ever-changing scenery and sensational views. You can also see the dramatic rock formations from the saddle of your bike for example on the Elbe Cycle Route that runs alongside the national park. Many paths within the Saxon Switzerland National Park are also suitable for bikes. A dramatic backdrop for film and opera Because of the uniqueness of the landscape Saxon Switzerland has been used as a film set by many international film directors. Famous operas are also performed amid the rocks and crags on one of the most beautiful open-air stages in Europe. read more » « less Saxon Switzerland National Park Unique features Dramatic rock formations of the Elbe Sandstone Massif Open-air theatre Activities Rock climbing rock climbing lessons walking cycling Landscapes Crags forests rivers Contact for accessible holidays Peggy Nestler Email p.nestler@saechsische-schweiz.de Tel +49 03501 470 130 Travel information Closest ICE train station and closest major city Dresden 37km Related topics Towns & cities Walking Cycling Accessible travel Discover more in the local region Elbe Cycle Route – From Dresden to the coastal mudflats » The Zittau Mountains Nature Park Unspoilt.

It was take two of my attempt at climbing Kawah Ijen and I had woken up at 1am in order to see the stars and blue flames. My high from the natural beauty plummeted upon making my way down. Something all-too-typical happened. A miner asked the fellow hiker I was walking with we had met at the blue flames and bonded over our mutual near-asphyxiation from the sulfuric fumes for a cigarette. He offered him a Marlboro and the man turned it down instead asking for money to buy the cigarettes he actually wanted. Really? The audacity! Flames Cool. Rudeness Not Rewind to my first day in Sumatra. I was in Medan and covered myself from head to toe thinking I would be alright. I walked outside and immediately was bombarded with catcalls and rude gestures. I was so intimidated that I retreated to my hotel and didn’t leave again for three days. Then there was the bus trip between Flores and Lombok. It mostly went well but somewhere between Labuan Bajo and Bima a boy seated next to the old lady who I had bonded with on the boat whispered something to her the two traded seats and before I knew it his hand was on my thigh. Uh What? Unhand me you man-child! Then I had the worst day of my travels so far getting scammed and cheated seemed to be the name of the game in Indonesia and I was getting really sick of it. It probably didn’t help that I had just had an easy six weeks in Malaysia where most people spoke English and were genuinely pleased to have me there visiting. I was viewed as a guest and was generally treated as such. When I finally did make my way to Sempol the jumping off point for Kawah Ijen I walked to a warung small eatery about 1km away from my guesthouse to save some money on dinner. Several times young men would stop near me on their motorbikes for the sole purpose of taunting me and making rude gestures with their fingers. What could I do? I just ignored it and kept walking a little more dejected each time. Why? Why is it ok to make rude gestures at me just because I’m a foreigner? I braced myself for another battle when I made my way to the bus stop after climbing Kawah Ijen. Sure enough several young men rode by taunting me but I just ignored them and kept my nose in my book. Then something odd happened. A truck carrying a brand new motorbike pulled over and a uniformed young man stepped out. Bondowoso?” he asked. Yes that was where I was going. He offered me a ride. Skeptical and jaded I asked how much money he was looking for. He looked surprised and said he wanted nothing. Something about his demeanor made me trust him and I climbed inside with him and his two coworkers. Before long we were joking around and I was speaking with them in my very limited Indonesian while they did the same in their very limited English. We even stopped by a grocery store and they told me I could wait in the car. They emerged with a cold drink for me and the driver even though they given it was Ramadan had to abstain. How sweet is that? My new friends We dropped off the motorbike and I was invited into the buyer’s lovely home. Everyone was incredibly kind and I eventually made it to the bus station safe and sound. Just as promised they wanted nothing from me. I wish I could tell them now how much that really meant to me. It was one simple act of kindness but it set the tone for the rest of the trip which ended up being a little easier maybe simply due to my more positive outlook. They say all it takes to ruin a place is one bad egg but I think the opposite. All it took to restore my faith in Indonesia was one random act of kindness.

I know what you mean about Indonesia getting frustrating at times we just finished a two month stint over there and while there were so many good times there were more than a handful of times when you just wanted to lock yourself away from the hello misterrrrr”s and constant staring which we actually did in Medan as well haha! Locked ourselves in our hotel room for two days watched TV ordered take-out and sat on wifi. We’ve just been in Malaysia for two days and can’t believe how insanely different it is over here but Indonesia really was something special 🙂 Reply Kristin says 08/12/2013 at 1211 pm I finally started saying miss” when someone would call me mister. Sounds like we did the same thing in Medan! Reply Dhany says 04/14/2019 at 353 pm Kristin come here to tasikmalaya indonesia we’ll guide you to many beautifull place in here genuinly 🙂 Reply Thomas | Jus Getaway says 08/12/2013 at 844 am What a great story. Not sure I would have gotten in the truck thought it seemed to work out for you. Heard too many horror stories. What kind of jerk would turn down someone giving them cig’s and ask for money to get their own??!!! Reply Kristin says 08/12/2013 at 1213 pm Hitching is definitely always a risk but it has always gone really well for me. Reply Amanda @ Adventure Year says 08/12/2013 at 857 am That situation you were in sounds really really tough mentally. I’m so glad these guys were around to help you out! I think your way of looking at the eggs” is pretty accurate. I suppose it just depends to me how bad the bad egg” is. Reply Kristin says 08/12/2013 at 1210 pm True but I really do try not to let one bad egg ruin a place for me. Sometimes it’s unavoidable though. Reply Emma @ GottaKeepMovin says 08/12/2013 at 1120 am I love these little moments when your faith in humanity is restored! I definitely would say to anyone think twice about getting into a van with some strangers in a place like this but I know what you mean when you said something about his demeanor made you trust him. I’ve had a few similar situations where I think ‘To anyone else it would this was a ridiculous idea that could get me into trouble but I just have a good feeling about these guys’ and I end up having an experience like yours. Definitely something to say about trusting your gut. Thanks for sharing! Reply Kristin says 08/12/2013 at 1210 pm You said it perfectly it seems like a ridiculous idea but at the time it just felt right. Reply Lilian says 08/12/2013 at 120 pm Aw those guys seem so sweet. I love random acts of kindness they remind you that the world isn’t such a scary place as we’re sometimes led to believe. Reply Kristin says 08/13/2013 at 1146 am Absolutely Reply Jo The Blond says 08/13/2013 at 212 am It’s true what Morgan Freeman said that one random act of kindness at a time can change someone’s world. It wasn’t much – a drink a life a cheerful ride with cheerful company – but it made the whole Indonesia look better in your eyes. These memories will stay with you for a very very long time 🙂 Reply Kristin says 08/13/2013 at 1147 am I try to remind myself of that when interacting with complete strangers. Sometimes just complimenting someone’s hair can make them feel better or letting them go first in line can brighten their day even just a little bit. Reply Steph @ 20 Years Hence says 08/13/2013 at 545 pm For me travel has really been all about these little moments. Some countries have had them in spades e.g. Philippines Taiwan and other places we’ve had to work a bit harder for them but they are always worthwhile. Probably the country where we felt the most similar to you was China. We just felt that by & large the people weren’t very friendly and we found everything so frustrating and were constantly worried about being scammed that we were really starting to feel like everyone there was out to get us. And then we spent a day exploring the city of Guilin which everyone told us to skip because it was boring and in the same day met 2 people who went out of their way to help us out of nothing more than the goodness of their hearts. It was a real eye-opener and while I can’t say it salvaged China for us it did help us realize that our own attitude certainly wasn’t helping matters. You can find good people everywhere in the world you just have to be open to it! Reply Kristin says 08/13/2013 at 641 pm Sorry to hear that about China. Taiwan is pretty special with how nice people are. Reply Angela says 08/14/2013 at 236 pm Things like this always seem to happen when you need them most. And thank God for moments like this! Without them travel would suck sometimes! We had several random acts of kindness that made me change the way I look at people for ever. Reply Kristin says 08/14/2013 at 427 pm Yes without the random acts of kindness I’d be a bitter bitter person! Reply Gerald Englebretsen says 08/17/2013 at 542 am Can recognise what you are relating and also pleased so pleased to hear that you had that moment that allowed you to charge on through. Been to Indonesia many times including all of the places you have mentioned. Luckily I have developed firm friendships which have allowed me to get very much down and local. It does change your outlook. Agree with the comparison between Indo and Malaysia tho – it just takes some getting used to when you come from one to the other. Great travel writing however. You have painted some great word pictures of the experience. Reply Kristin says 08/17/2013 at 1259 pm Thanks and I definitely appreciate the Indonesian people I’ve come to know well. They are very kind and generous. Reply apol says 08/17/2013 at 933 am sounds very infuriating… those rude gestures they do those to foreigners only? Is that a cultural thing there? glad you were fine…those guys were heaven sent! Reply Kristin says 08/17/2013 at 1258 pm I mean young guys cat-call here in the USA as well so I don’t think it’s necessarily a cultural thing. I do think it is more directed at foreigners than local women though. Reply Vira says 09/03/2013 at 1102 pm As an Indonesian I can’t not feel embarrassed knowing that foreigners are sometimes treated badly by our people. I’m sorry you had to experience such troubles. And I’m thankful for the kind guys that made your trip much more pleasant.. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/03/2013 at 1113 pm It could happen anywhere though. Just the other day in Las Vegas a taxi driver tried to cheat me by not running the meter properly. Proof that it happens back home too! Reply Liz says 10/07/2013 at 138 pm I had a similar great experience in Yogyakarta Indonesia. I was even teary-eyed when I boarded my plane to Bali because the kindness shown to me meant so much that I no longer want to leave! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 10/09/2013 at 809 am It’s so nice! Reply ika says 03/17/2014 at 344 am i am indonesian. Actually what was happened to you can also happens to local women. that’s why many parents don’t allow their daughter to travel alone. Great respect to you for your courage to do a solo traveling. it’s very nice experience. Reply Kristin says 03/17/2014 at 456 am I’m humbled by your comment. I didn’t realize it also happens to local women. Reply ika says 03/17/2014 at 717 am yup but please don’t think that all of Indonesian always act that way. The are many Indonesian that will welcome foreigners kindly. So don’t worry to travel around my country. Happy traveling! Reply christine says 06/16/2014 at 609 am Dear Kristin I can totally understand what you’ve been through while traveling in indonesia. traveling in here definitely is not an easy one. I have the same unease experience while cycling solo around Maninjau Lake west sumatera. People stared me all the time children shouted hello..hello” making me uncomfortable and when I replied in bahasa they shouted again oh cina..cina”. Yes I’m indonesian chinese a sensitive subject in this so called multicultural country something that the low class of education never understand and need to change asap. I get scam too so it is not for foreigner only so please do your research ahead. I also noticed that foreign traveler in indonesia become easily suspicious with the local people. I understand that maybe they are nice people who just have bad experiences like touts scams etc they become guarded and make interaction with the locals as minimal as it can. For me as a solo traveler in my own country it’s hard to mingle with you guys. My father always said The world have more Good People than bad ones” I still travel solo I have lots of good memories and make friends with the local. I do hope this random acts of kindness help restoring the goodness of our people in your eyes. try to explore the east of indonesia it is more remote there and the people also more nice in my opinion. Reply Sascha says 09/24/2014 at 858 pm I don’t get obscene or rude gestures I guess because I’m male. But I sometimes do get a bit harassed women holding my hand while taking a photo etc. I probably don’t get all the culture knacks but yes as a foreign traveller you are eyed in Indonesia pretty much all the time. Reply Kristin says 09/24/2014 at 1005 pm There should be a tumblr for how many Indonesian boys’ photos I’m in as well. Reply Sri says 07/07/2015 at 851 pm Yes. That’s Indonesia. So friendly Reply Klim says 04/11/2016 at 208 am I found this interesting considering the comparison you made with Malaysia. While as a male I’m not subjected to the harassment sad to hear it I also found Malaysia to be my favorite Asian country and Indonesia focused on largely getting your money. Which isn’t to say I haven’t had great times and met great people but as a whole right from stepping from the airport I knew I was in a different place from Malaysia akin to a mix of Thailand and Laos. And Medan is a special sort of awful and I only experienced it in passing but knew right away I wanted nothing to do with it- nowhere like it. Enjoy your posts. Hoping to follow your guidance from your other post when I go to Ijen after tomorrow. Reply Kristin says 04/13/2016 at 250 pm Ugh Medan is definitely a special kind of awful!

Hitchhiking Adventures in the Back of a 10-Wheeler Truck 06/01/2016 by Kristin 9 Comments Never in my life did I think I’d be riding in the back of a roadworks truck down a bumpy road in Chile passing around a bottle of wine with perfect strangers. This was my third ride while I hitchhiked down the Carretera Austral in Chilean Patagonia so if you haven’t read the first post go back so that this all makes sense. I’ll be waiting here for you patiently. We good? Aiiiight. Let’s do this As the sun rose on day two of the hitchhiking adventure Steve and I figured that the early bird would get the worm so we readied ourselves to leave our ridiculously basic hospidaje the kind of accommodation that is really common along the Carretera Austral where building materials and really anything at all from civilization is hard to come by. I crouched under the dipping ceiling and stepped over the heads of the nails sticking up in the carpet and looked out the window. It was raining. Pouring in fact. It would either prove to be an advantage by discouraging other hitchhikers or one long wet and frustrating day. We walked out to the end of the town of La Junta where we’d made it to the previous day stacked the bags on each other with the rain covers on so that they’d be dry enough threw on our ski jackets we still had in our packs from Austria and stuck our thumbs up. Not many cars came by. Those that did were either full or disinterested in picking up soaking wet passengers. We entertained ourselves by playing games like I see something yellow.” Whenever a cyclist would bike by we’d cheer for him or her and they always smiled or even laughed happy to have the encouragement. The day trudged on and the rain never let up. We wondered if there was any possibility of catching a bus and took a stroll back into town for some lunch and to check the time tables. There wasn’t a bus going in our direction and there wouldn’t be until the next morning at 6am. We walked back to the curb and the wind and rain picked up. The previous day it had been Steve who had to talk me out of giving up and that day standing in the rain for the better part of six hours it was my turn to keep the spirits up. Just as we were discussing whether to give up or not a 10-wheeler truck drove by and given I didn’t see any room in the front and they never stop anyways I didn’t lift my arm. Then to my astonishment I saw the truck pull over to pick up a group of four girls 50 meters or so behind us. A pair of hands stuck out from the back of the truck and started pulling up their bags for them. For real this is happening?! Photo taken at the end after we got out Oh my god he’s picking them up!” I gasped to Steve. Then without another word I took off running hoping to whatever powers that be that I would make it there before the truck took off again. Now a rational person might think to themselves Hmm riding in the back of a dirty-ass dump truck does not sound ideal and I would normally agree but I was no longer rational at that point. The driver was out and standing next to the door when I arrived. Dos personas mas por favor?” I stammered in broken Spanish breathless. A middle-aged very relaxed-looking Chilean man jovially smiled and nodded in approval back at me as if to say well of course why didn’t you ask when I passed you the first time? I took off running back towards Steve who grabbed two of the bags and met me halfway then went back for the other two. The same pair of hands reached out from the top of the truck bed and pulled our bags in. Then Steve climbed up and I right after him. I couldn’t believe what I saw in there. There were a good dozen or so other young people sitting together in a circle all hitchhikers. They were mostly Chileans a couple of Colombians and a couple young Spaniards all of whom were wet and a little dirty from the asphalt still inside of the truck but smiling big and welcoming us with open arms. The crew We sat on our backpacks and once Steve was satisfied that nothing was crushing his drone pack settled in for the bumpy and hilarious ride. There was a white tarp on top of the truck bed to cover us from the rain and probably any authorities because as a guy in the truck who spoke English pretty well confirmed it was definitely not legal to carry passengers in the back of a truck in Chile. I looked to my right and one of the Colombians was cradling a jumbo bottle of wine like a baby in his jacket. He took out two coffee cups with lids and poured them full of wine then started passing them around. Next thing I knew someone took out a portable speaker and started playing Chilean reggae music. The crew after the ride I covered the driver’s face so he can’t get into trouble It was the absolute best afternoon ever. I mean honestly how often do you find yourself in the middle of Patagonia passing around wine with a bunch of people in a 10-wheeler truck? We bid our friends goodbye and strapped on the backpacks once more to search out accommodation and just as we did a couple of cyclists came by all smiles Hey you were the ones who cheered for us! Glad to see you made it.” Upon seeing the town we’d arrived in Puyuhuapi I was very glad too. It was absolutely gorgeous and surrounded by national parks we’d explore over the next few days. But that’s a story for another time. Share Tweet Pin 1shares « Dear Millennials You Already Have the Answer Is This Real Life? Patagonia’s Most Incredible Hanging Glacier » Hello There!

Rain pitter-pattered outside as I read – it was a particularly rainy winter after all. I can still remember where I was sitting on the couch while I imagined the adventure proposed. Want to come backpacking in Alaska?” Um yes! Eight months later I boarded a plane to Anchorage to hike for 8 days in the backcountry with two near-perfect strangers. Though hiking is a favorite pastime of mine I’d never done so without any kind of trail and without the prospect of seeing any other people. Bears moose and wolverines would grace my presence several times though. Hi bear! You guys this was the hike of a lifetime. I never realized prior to this how profoundly life-changing it can be to not only disassociate from the world of news the internet and whatever drama plays out but to be in a place so remote that you can’t hope to drive there can’t get a GPS signal and completely let go of typical human life amenities. I’ve never felt so connected even though I was totally disconnected. I’ve never felt my humanness more. I’ve never been so present in my life. When you’re out in the Alaskan backcountry you’re truly in the palm of mother nature’s hand. And it can change your life. Real adventure is defined best as a journey from which you may not come back alive and certainly not as the same person – Yvon Chouinard The adventure took place in Wrangell St. Elias National Park in the southeast corner of Alaska right on the border with Canada. I’d never heard of this park before but it’s actually the largest in the United States – large enough to encapsulate six Yellowstones. It’s also home to the majority of the tallest mountain peaks in the US. And yet there was almost nobody there especially on the portion from Iceberg Lake to Bremner. Over the course of eight days we saw one other hiking group in the distance barely close enough to wave and be acknowledged and that was it. Taken from the flight to the start of the hike For all intents and purposes I was completely at nature’s mercy searching for moose trails and passing several sets of grizzly tracks. I wonder how many bears watched me as I hiked on by. I thought about all of this as I stared at the glaciers before me stretching around every mountain in sight with joining lobes of glacier pouring out of valleys and topping peaks. Everyone said that Alaska is vast and enchanting and those words are simply too weak to fully describe it. I’m not sure that any words can. Frolicking in my version of paradise. There were a few planes here and there taking scenic flights but otherwise it was ours. I kept wondering how something so beautiful could be so empty but in truth it’s not that hard to figure out. A random discovery just over a rock pile from where I slept one night. You have to fly in and the hike is tough. You have to hike over this kind of terrain. It’s a lot of steep ups and downs on rocks traversing glaciers with crampons bush whacking for hours and walking through terrain that sinks below your feet – it is exhausting. This is marshy. My feet were often wet. It’s also the best hike I’ve ever done because it was impressive sight after mind blowing sight and I just could not get over the feeling of having nobody else around am I perseverating yet?. No selfie sticks no bus loads no noise no ambient lighting. Stop it Alaska. Just clean air some of the clearest water on the planet mist rainbows moose did I mention moose? I love moose sun mist snow and bucketloads of wild blueberries. Moose! Honestly how does one find such unspoiled beauty otherwise? I’ve tasted it in Kyrgyzstan and saw some of it on the toughest hike of my life in Patagonia but this! This was even more remote vast and untouched. This view though. Plus it turned out that taking a hike with these particular two near-perfect strangers was a fantastic idea. My guide Pete the sender of the email invite. Master of the compass. Because it so happens that we share the same inner 13-year-old sense of humor. And when you’re hiking for 8 days with someone you hope to dear God almighty whatever you understand him/it to be that y’all get along. Did I really just use ‘y’all’? Though I do love solo traveling this is not something to attempt alone so it was awesome to be with such laid-back fun-loving people. Pete was all You’ll scare the bears away wearing that” and I was all Nope I’ll blend in.” Who was right? Now I’m left with a desire not only to seek out hikes where I might not see other signs of human life because something about returning to the root of humankind is cathartic but to explore a whole lot more of Alaska. Exploring ice caves And I want everyone to know what this feels like. Want to have the same experience in the Alaskan wilderness? Let us help you plan the most epic adventure to Alaska!

Keep it up! Also I’ve learnt a new word – perseverate. Thanks! Reply Kristin says 09/18/2017 at 1000 pm That’s awesome! Thanks for letting me know! I loved seeing the O’Higgins glacier. So much more under the radar than the other more famous ones in Patagonia. Reply Ioanna says 09/19/2017 at 334 am Stop killing me with all those photos! Alaska is so beautiful and I really hope I can visit it one day… but as much as I love hiking alone I think I would only go with a well-experienced guide – I am too scared of bears and getting lost 🙂 Great idea with the trips too! Happy travels Ioanna A Woman Afoot Reply Rahul says 09/20/2017 at 725 pm This looks beautiful Kristin! I ended up doing the Huemul Circuit last year after first finding out about it through your blog post. Now I’m certain I’ll find myself in Alaska at some point after reading this. If one wanted to do the same hike you did how would one do it? I see you listed the name of the park and where to fly into and some of the landmarks in the park. Do you know if it’s possible to find a guide or someone to go with who knows the area well for your particular route? I imagine this requires a fair bit of navigational and outdoors experience as well. Reply Kristin says 09/21/2017 at 125 am Yeah you should go with Pete! He’s an expert navigator and he’s done this route several times – he’s the one who I went with and who I’ll be partnering with to lead tours myself Sparkexpeditions.com Reply Anja says 10/02/2017 at 202 pm Wow what a great adventure! Reply Jillian Michelle says 10/11/2017 at 350 pm I feel a little embarrassed that I’d never even heard of Wrangell St. Elias National Park until now but — freaking wow — it’s definitely going on my bucket list now. Your photos are amazing! Absolutely breathtaking! I’m a tad bit afraid of getting eaten by a grizzly bear lolololol but I’m determined to do this hike one day for sure!! <3 <3 Reply Carla says 10/30/2018 at 305 am Are you planning to do this trip again in 2019? Reply Kristin says 11/04/2018 at 1240 pm Iceland hiking instead! Perhaps another time though if enough people are interested!

A playful grinning white face looked back up at me her head cocked to the side as only Belugas and Narwhals can do. We checked each other out she whistling and me squealing in delight equally curious about the other creature we were seeing. Oh hi! I went to Churchill in the far north of Manitoba in Canada with the express purpose of seeing Beluga whales. Each summer between June and August 60000 of them swim into the brackish water of the Hudson Bay where the temperature is slightly warmer and more hospitable for their calfs. They reminded me of the bottlenose dolphins I grew up seeing off the coast of California playful curious and not the least bit shy. I always felt a kindred tie to them being as much of a fish myself as a person can be. In Churchill there are several ways to interact with them both dry and wet. First we took a zodiac boat out and watching as they get closer and closer swimming under and around the boat. Things got even more exciting when we climbed into kayaks that afternoon paddling in the calm bay while slowly but surely they came over and started bubbling up around us and even getting close enough to bump my boat. I kept giggling and squealing which you already know if you watched in my Instagram story from the day. They got so close! We also snorkeled with them donning dry suits and floating in the frigid water. I know it was cold but to be honest I hardly even noticed because I was so engaged with what I was seeing below listening to the whistles of the belugas and almost crying with delight while they floated under me looking up and smiling. The belugas from up above Few animal activities have allowed me to get this close to the wildlife. There was the standout experience of seeing a Manta ray glide right over my head in Komodo Indonesia and the magic of standing just a few feet away from Gorillas in Uganda and now this rounds out my top three wildlife experiences. The zodiac boat That’s not even all there is up in Churchill though. It’s a triple threat with possible polar bear and northern lights sightings as well. SO CUTE and deadly I visited with Lazy Bear Expeditions which also took us out on a boat up north to see if we could find some bears as well. Though they’re much more common in the autumn months unfortunately the belugas are already gone by then and they were my main draw. By heading up in late July I got to have both. A mother and baby beluga you know the song! As far as I know Lazy Bear is the only outfit in town with a boat of this size that takes you out to see the bears in the summer. Otherwise in the fall it’s all about the arctic crawlers in the tundra so this is a unique experience. We got pretty close I was able to snap this This too The trip also includes other extras like exploration around town to this downed aircraft. You can climb in and around it which I absolutely loved as did the kids on the trip. SO RAD You can also kindly ask for a wake up call if the aurora activity is high enough and the skies are clear. Since Churchill has the possibility of seeing the northern lights 330 days of the year you just might see them even in the summer. Sadly due to a combo of low activity and clouds I didn’t see them this time but that’s okay I did in Iceland and Finland and I will again one day I’m sure of that. Some caribou on the shore Before visiting Manitoba I had no idea how many cool things there are to see there. I was shocked that so few of my travel blogging peers had made it up to Churchill considering how incredibly cool it is to see Belugas and how close I was able to get to them. Manitoba is so underrated. Go for the animals and stay for the provincial parks and 100000 lakes. Do it yourself Getting there After a flood wiped out a section of tracks this year now the only way to get up to Churchill is to fly. Lazy Bear offers a chartered flight as part of their package. Costs The base rate for the trips with Lazy Bear start at $4000 CAD roughly $3100 USD at the time of this writing which includes the flight accommodation most meals and most activities with a few add-ons. For solo travelers This isn’t a trip that’s easy to do independently. You need someone around who has a gun just to scare off the bears if needed and to be in a group for safety reasons. The kayaks and the trips are all tied to various lodges so book ahead before traveling to Churchill. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Lazy Bear Expeditions.

We baulked at heading to Churchill during our recent trip to Canada as our budget was getting tight but this post has renewed our interest. If it’s anywhere near as incredible as mantas and gorillas then we’d be crazy not to put it right at the top of our bucket list. Better start saving . . . . thanks for the inspiration! Reply GG says 08/20/2017 at 857 am The video and description of your encounter with the belugas was nothing short of unbelievably cool! Your videos get better each time. My only experience with belugas are in the aquarium and I worry about them because even if it is the biggest tank in the world it isn’t nearly enough space! To swim with them would be worth the trip to Churchill alone! What a big pull for me. I am into marine life. Hope to experience a loggerhead nesting swim with manatees and let’s add belugas to the list! Did not realize Churchill had so much to offer with the museum art work rivaling any big city in the U.S. with the limited resources too! polar bears and beluga experiences in the same week in addition to scientific research which is what I am into the bay itself the interesting history other wildlife etc.! I am most familiar with Churchill more from the meteorological side with it being a favorite place to mention in weather forecasts about arctic chills coming down to the United States. Little do they know it can reach 99F 37C well it is the record high in addition to sub -40F and C in the winter. The big deal up there I think is reaching freezing in January. It has never happened in recorded history in Churchill. The record high is 30F and they have kept records for a long time. I remember they forecasted freezing a few years back and everyone was worrying about climate change but it hit 30F. If that ever happens it will be a really big deal there. Something like thunderstorms in Barrow Alaska several years back which is super rare. It is great how you support these small communities and less known jewels by your site. It is a great side effect of your work! Hope they get that train back up and running feel bad it is an American company that is sitting on their heels maybe the locals can buy it and fix it! As a point of discussion for all Let’s not let climate change be an excuse to abandon these northern communities in favor of another area. Sometimes a real big problem can be exploited politically to push another agenda. You really can be exactly sure what will happen. Sure the frozen road might last shorter and there might be higher water levels but you can adapt and who knows what will happen exactly there versus elsewhere e.g. the Yukon! Some things are obvious like coastal city management and adaptation but assuming stronger monsoons in SW U.S. or SE Asia versus weaker and stronger versus weaker hurricanes/typhoons in the Gulf coast/SE Asia is not so clear! I might revisit this with the next post you made if that is okay with everyone! Reply GG says 08/20/2017 at 859 am Ugh meant really can’t be sure!” in the last paragraph! Reply Kristin says 08/21/2017 at 101 am Thanks as always for your insightful comments! I am also hoping that there is a way that the railroad can get fixed and also feel bad it’s a private American company causing the issue. Reply Izy Berry says 08/20/2017 at 916 am Baby beluga!! Is the water warm is your mama home. Lol Reply Stay Connected Home About Contact Me Archives Privacy Policy and Disclaimer © 2020 · Be My Travel Muse. All Rights Reserved 227shares,Promotion

Offbeat Travel Getting a Sak Yant Tattoo From a Monk 01/02/2013 by Kristin 141 Comments Day 80 It was just after the Lantern Festival had culminated on a warm night in Chiang Mai. I had met up with my friend Yvonne and admired her back tattoo as we walked to a local bar to bond over Changs. We got on the topic of tattoos and I admitted to her that I had twice made an appointment to get some ink and twice backed out deciding that what I thought I wanted ultimately lacked enough meaning to carry on my person forever. This was when I heard about the magical monk tattoo and finally felt I might have found the perfect tattoo for me – something that had a deeper meaning than any other tattoo could possibly possess. Magic Sak Yant tattoo The Sak Yant tattoo at Wat Bang Phra 55km outside of Bangkok is performed by a monk in exchange for a small donation of flowers cigarettes and incense that is then recycled and sold again in order to keep the wat afloat. In exchange the monk considers which of the 80-something Sak Yant symbols would best suit your needs and where on the body it belongs. Without any prior discussion he then gets to work. Click here for deals on the best Bangkok hotels His tools are a long bamboo pole and ink made from snake’s venom Chinese charcoal ink and palm oil. We made plans to meet again in a few weeks in Bangkok and get the tattoo done by Luang Pi Nunn who we later realized is considered the most famous monk in Bangkok to perform this art. His predecessor Flash forward several weeks I awoke at the ripe hour of 430am to meet up with Yvonne to get our tattoos done. Oh who am I kidding? I was too excited/scared to sleep at all. Aware of just how popular Wat Bang Phra is amongst locals to get their Sak Yant tattoos we knew we had to catch the 6am bus that leaves from the Victory Monument in Bangkok in order to be first in line. We got to the temple seamlessly after alighting the bus and catching a delightful moto-taxi ride through rice paddies as the red sun was rising. Hello Wat Bang Phra We arrived at the wat a little unsure what to do next. A little Thai man roused from his slumber and helped us purchase our offerings for 65 baht then handed us pink envelopes to put additional offerings into. In all I donated 120 baht USD$4 –not bad for a tattoo!. The offering I somehow ended up at the front of the queue. There were about 15 of us in the room – locals Yvonne and myself. I had wanted Yvonne to go first given she already has tattoos and therefore would naturally be less anxious than I would be right?. However I was beckoned by the monk and there was no turning back. I crawled into position bent over a pyramid pillow and dug my nails into my arm so that I would be able to focus my pain on another area. Two men on either side of me held my skin taut while the monk a piece of paper separating his hand from my skin as he can’t touch female flesh dipped his long bamboo needle into ink. My new friends who held me in place for the monk to apply the tattoo The tapping began. We had not selected a precise location – he just went for it. I knew from the beginning that I had to put faith in his design choice and placement based on his interpretation of my aura – based on his opinion of what blessing I needed most. I knew that I would have no say in what tattoo I got or where. Ten minutes and roughly 3000 strikes later I had a new tattoo. I had expected the pain to be out of this world but in reality it has nothing on recovering from a shoulder surgery. I’d give it a 7/10 on the pain scale. It was therapeutic in a way and only lasted for ten or so minutes. The back of a local and fellow patron that day As he finished he blew on the tattoo to breathe power into it as he chanted a blessing. He then moved on to Yvonne unto whom he bestowed the same tattoo. Though we were not allowed to take pictures in the room where the process takes place I snuck one of Yvonne quickly with my iPhone. When hers was finished we left the room and excitedly took pictures of each other’s tattoos so that we could see our fresh ink for the first time. Both looked amazing. He had given us the Hah Taew. Photo courtesy of Yvonne Though I will need to get the exact wording translated as each monk has his own version of the Hah Taew it generally bestows a blessing of loving kindness lifelong success charm good luck and protection against bad luck and evil spirits. This was easily one of the most magical and enduring parts of my journey so far. I will forever remember the beauty of the day and the uplifting feeling of the blessing. After all how can I forget? I’ll carry this reminder on my shoulder forever. Have you had a spiritual experience while traveling? Comment below! 2015 UPDATE I’ve recently been informed that the main monk who gives tattoos has switched to a gun rather than a bamboo needle. His poor wrists have gotten too tired. Therefore if you want a bamboo tattoo I’d highly recommend meeting with an ajarn — a monk in training — which takes place in a much cleaner environment gives you an opportunity to discuss which tattoo you’ll receive and still ends with a blessing. The experience sounds absolutely amazing and is probably how I’ll get any future Sak Yant tattoos. Click here to book an ajarn tattoo session in Bangkok or in Chiang Mai. Pin me! 2013 UPDATE I’ve had all kinds of emails from readers so I just want to answer some commonly asked questions No you do not make an appointment you just have to show up. No it’s not a new needle. No you do not communicate with the monk. It will not be a new needle and you do not get to choose the tattoo you’ll be given! Would I take the risk again? No I would not. I have had blood work done long since getting the tattoo and have come out fine but I have to say I was sweating that one a bit and realize now that despite how amazing the experience was it’s not worth catching a disease. Most importantly please remember this is not just a souvenir it’s something that has deep spiritual meaning. Please read this post carefully and understand the customs before you go. Happy traveling!

Reply Kristin Addis says 01/09/2013 at 443 am Everyone is shocked he did it so quickly! I guess most people with this tattoo suffered an hour plus. Reply Abby says 01/03/2013 at 336 am I just got a tattoo while traveling through Japan I’ve also gotten one in South Korea but I have to say that yours is very lovely and the story makes it even more special.

Reply Kristin Addis says 01/09/2013 at 443 am I could kind of tell by the stamp he put on my back and the location that he was going to give me the ha thaew I had about a split second to recognize it before he got started but it was the one I had wanted after all.

Coool.. Do you ever been to India or Kerala? Reply Kristin Addis says 01/09/2013 at 356 pm I have not but it’s definitely on my list! Reply 123seminarsonly.com says 01/09/2013 at 651 pm 🙂 You are most welcome to Kerala… I am sure you will like Kerala.. 🙂 Lauren says 01/04/2013 at 755 am Wow! Love it! How safe is it though in terms of the spike they use… is hasn’t been in anyone else’s skin has it? Reply Kristin Addis says 01/09/2013 at 441 am Honestly he does use the same one on everyone and cleans it in-between. This is why I was really happy to go first – before anyone else had been tattooed. Ian Ord’s blog which I linked above goes into the safety a lot more. He did a lot of research before getting his done a few months ago and decided that it was safe enough to get done after speaking to some medical professionals. Still a risk though. Reply Lauren says 01/09/2013 at 514 am Thanks so much looks like an incredible experience. Reply JustChuckinIt says 01/05/2013 at 640 pm Welcome to the club darling!!! So happy you finally got inked and I don’t think there is any better way than to do that. What a beautiful blessing and so fitting of your personality. I’m definitely going to be getting a bamboo tattoo when I am in SE Asia. Reply Kristin Addis says 01/09/2013 at 437 am Thanks much dude 🙂 Reply Cale says 02/25/2017 at 422 am How do you book an appointment for a Sak yant tattoo ? Reply Kristin says 02/25/2017 at 1030 pm If you want to visit an ajarn you can follow the link on the page. If you to go the wat you can’t book an appointment. Reply Trudy says 01/16/2013 at 452 pm Wow this is a gorgeous story. I love the end tattoo and would love to get one. Maybe one day… haha still a bit nerve wracking for me I think! Reply Kristin Addis says 01/20/2013 at 429 am It was for me too. I didn’t sleep at all the night before because I was so nervous and excited! Reply Julie Kesti says 01/23/2013 at 744 am so cool! i’ve read about these magic tattoos but never a detailed story of someone getting one. fascinating. were the other people there mostly men or do women typically get them as well? thanks for sharing your story! Reply Kristin Addis says 01/23/2013 at 631 pm It’s mostly men who get them though there were some other women there as well. It’s actually somewhat common for women to get an invisible” tattoo with just oil instead of ink because it’s not always desirable for Thai women to have visible tattoos. We were sure to specify that we wanted ink! Reply Jack Denial says 01/28/2013 at 1001 pm Love your tattoo Reply Kristin Addis says 02/11/2013 at 747 pm Thank you 🙂 Reply Sarah Henry says 03/01/2013 at 1124 am I’m going to Thailand and thinking of getting a Sak Yant Tattoo as well. I love the meaning behind it. How do you know what to do ritually approaching the monk and the offering etc.? Reply Kristin Addis says 03/02/2013 at 935 pm The other people in the room motioned to me when it was time to bow etc. They were very sweet and understanding. Reply Rojin says 04/02/2013 at 1017 am Hey Kristin I’m in chiang mai and want to get a sak yant as I have for years. Is there NO possibility that you can choose what yantra and placement? Hmmm Reply admin says 04/02/2013 at 806 pm Chances are good it will be placed somewhere on your upper back. They don’t do below the waist. You can try showing the monk a photo of the one you want and hope he’ll comply. I just decided that I liked all of them and would be happy no matter what. Another thing you can do is visit a tattoo artist if you want total control however you lost the meaning in that case. I’m sure whatever you or the monk chooses you’ll be happy with the final product 🙂 Reply Danielle says 04/02/2013 at 237 pm loved your post! I am hoping to be returning to Thailand Was there Nov/Dec 2012 April/May 2014! Getting a Sak Yant is on my to do list as I just love the story/history behind it all! I know it is common for women to get the Sak Yant in oil as opposed to ink- were you able to let them know you wanted ink prior or was it determined by the monk? Thank-you! Reply admin says 04/02/2013 at 810 pm It is common for women to get the sak yant with oil as you mentioned. The monk seemed to know that since we were foreigners we were probably seeking one with ink and he squirted ink into the cup he used to dip the needle in. You could always point to ink if it looks to you like he’s going for oil. Reply Sean says 04/12/2013 at 232 pm Cool ink and story. I’m an American martial artist going there for the first time in June and want to he ink done also. I want mine in a certain place did the monk when u were there comply with such request? Also what about the needles/ink sterilization? Thanks for any info Reply admin says 04/15/2013 at 539 am I didn’t ask him for a specific place but you can always try. I don’t want to say he’ll do it because I am really not sure if he will or not! As for sterilization he cleans the bamboo needle between each person but not use a new needle. Needless to say I was glad to have gone first. Reply dede says 06/07/2013 at 744 pm so glad that i’ve found your blog wanna get a sak yant at bang phra too but confuse whether woman can get one or not by the ajarn some says cant but other say yes you can. so  on my next trip to bkk definetly will go to bang phra ! Reply Lindsey says 06/28/2013 at 1138 am This is awesome! I’m into tattoos especially religious tattoos and I’m going to study abroad in Chiang Mai for 4 months this fall. Were there certain days that the monk would tattoo that I should be aware of? Also how was your healing? Thanks for any info! Lindsey P Reply Kristin says 07/06/2013 at 939 pm I think he tattoos every day. Healing was pretty easy given it’s a bamboo tattoo. Within three or so days you’re good to swim and within ten you should be almost completely healed. It feels like a bad sunburn at first but that subsides with time. Reply Camille says 07/05/2013 at 237 am Hello! I love reading your stories! i found your blog when i was looking on the internet about yantra tattoos! I really want to get one the way you did but obviously people told me it was very dangerous you could get any kind of disease! did you have any trouble? also did you put any cream on it after? Thank you for your answers! i’ll be in BKK in august i can’t wait! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 07/27/2013 at 1254 am Hey Camille It’s a risk for sure but I’ve been fine. I put benpanthen on after. Reply Bell | Wanderlust Marriage says 07/06/2013 at 237 am Wow what an amazing experience thank you for sharing. I’d be anxious about it but it really does sound like such a special experience. Thank you for sharing. Reply Kristin says 07/27/2013 at 1254 am was very special 🙂 Reply Liron says 07/21/2013 at 128 am i like ur tattoo. Based on ur experience for women to go for such tattoo what is best for her wear? As i know the men will remove their shirt. is there any translator when you went to temple? Reply Kristin says 07/22/2013 at 111 am I wore a button-down shirt backwards and undid the top few buttons when it was my turn. There is no translator. There are no words exchanged anyways. He just does what he feels like doing! Reply Vince says 07/27/2013 at 1250 am Hi is there any full address ? or just tell the taxi driver will do & they know where to bring us? the monk do there everyday? Reply Kristin says 07/27/2013 at 1252 am Hey Vince If there is a fixed address I’m honestly not aware of it. The motorbike taxi I described should know exactly where wat bang phra” is. To my knowledge the monk is there daily yes. I’m thinking on religious holidays it’s not open but I’m really not sure. Reply Vince says 07/27/2013 at 1256 am tks. was thinking wheather can book a taxi from bbk to & flow. Reply Kristin says 07/27/2013 at 912 pm I”m sure you can Reply Chris says 08/13/2013 at 615 pm Hi there sounds amazing! Going tiget this done myself in a few weeks just a quick one how easy is it get back from he temple to bangkok when your done? Thanks Reply Kristin says 08/13/2013 at 640 pm Really easy. Just hop on the bus that’s right outside of the wat. It starts running later in the day. Reply Hemant says 10/05/2013 at 1101 pm I got a tattoo the day I turned 18. I love tattoos because they can help you express yourself. I plan on getting lots of other tattoos in the future. Hopefully I can get my second one soon. Reply Reema says 10/15/2013 at 918 pm Hi I am headed to Thailand in april for two to three weeks just wondering how long between getting the design of the tattoo and getting it done did you wait? Is two weeks enough time? Loved this post inspired me to get one seems so peaceful and beautiful. Reply Kristin says 10/16/2013 at 303 am The answers to your questions are all in the post. It all happened within 15 minutes as I wrote and the designs are standard designs that have been around for centuries. Reply Dean says 10/26/2013 at 404 am Kristin absolutely fantastic. Staying in Bangkok for 2 more days but going to go tomorrow and hopefully get done. glad i found your web gunna bookmark you thanks Reply Alana says 11/03/2013 at 1151 pm Great story – a friend and I are going to get it this weekend. Not sure if you answered above but are there photos displayed to find out what it means? Thanks! Reply Anonymous says 11/09/2013 at 943 am Love the tattoo. I’m headed this this winter and plan to do this also. Do you know if these tattoos fade more than the typical” tattoos? I read that there are no confirmed cases of HIV from these tatoos. i hope this is true! *crossing fingers* Reply Renee says 11/09/2013 at 944 am Love the tattoo! Heading there this winter and planning to do this. Do you know if these tatoos fade more than usual ones? Reply Ari Chatz says 11/13/2013 at 509 am Cool tattoo idea. Always a good idea to choose something unique. It will serve as a permanent reminder of your trip. Reply Richard says 11/28/2013 at 349 pm There must be other Wats where the tattoos are done with disposable needles…the risk of HIV transmission is just too high…I had a Thai friend covered with tattoos who suddenly became a skeleton with AIDS… I am staying in Bangkok do you know of another Wat where the needles are each time new? Reply Kristin says 12/01/2013 at 752 am That’s how the wats operate but if you want a tattoo with a new needle just visit a tattoo artist. You lose the authenticity but it’s a trade off. I’m not sure if we should point to the tattoos as the reason for the AIDS but it’s always a risk. Reply Liz Fischer says 12/02/2013 at 238 am I read women must have transparent ink?? Is this true?? Reply Kristin says 12/02/2013 at 801 pm Haha well if you just look at the photos in this post it will answer your question. Some Thai women just want the blessing and not the ink so they ask to have it done in oil instead. When foreigners go the monks know they want ink so they do it in ink. Reply Nancy Nguyen says 01/07/2014 at 328 pm Hi I’m taking a trip to Thailand this summer and wanted to get a Sak Yant tattoo at the same place. I was wondering if I could specify where I want my tattoo because I’m trying to do a cover up of an old tattoo so hopefully they’ll be able to do it where I want it done? What hotel did you stay at? I’m trying to find a hotel close to the place Reply Kristin says 01/13/2014 at 552 am No you can’t specify where. I don’t think the monk would cover an existing tattoo. There aren’t really hotels nearby you have to head 55km outside of bangkok to get there. I honestly think you might prefer a tattoo artist since you want to be specific Reply Mark says 01/14/2014 at 910 am Nice tattoo but too bad you had to disrespect them by sneaking” a picture. Well it is all about you. Reply Kristin says 01/14/2014 at 754 pm Lots of people have taken pictures and even video of the process. I have the utmost of respect for them. Reply Nicole says 01/22/2014 at 325 pm Hello. You mentioned something about a stamp? So the monk has a stencil type thing he uses before he starts? And did you notice most people esp females getting the same tattoo as you? Thanks 🙂 Reply Kristin says 01/25/2014 at 857 am Yes and yes. Lots of people have this tattoo and that sometimes bothers me. Reply 5arx says 03/19/2014 at 229 am Though we were not allowed to take pictures in the room where the process takes place I snuck one of Yvonne quickly with my iPhone.” Good to see you displayed the proper respect for the monks’ customs while getting your bargain $4 tattoo. Reply Kristin says 03/19/2014 at 254 am They request that you don’t but if you look at just about every post on the subject full videos have been made. I have the utmost of respect for the monks and what they do. Reply johny says 04/18/2014 at 112 am Wow these tattoos looks amazing These tattoos are from Buddhism culture & today i also checked some Hindu Culture tattoos They was also awesome Reply Katia says 07/30/2014 at 1201 am Hi i’m katia and i’ll go to thailand on the next november i would like to make a tattoo in Wat Bang Phra. I would like to know if they make tattoo all day long or if they make them up to a precise time. I think to go on my last day in Thailand but i’ll not be there before 11.30 a.m and i don’t know if i can do it. Do you have more informations about this the closing time. thanks a lot katia. Reply Kristin says 07/30/2014 at 741 am I don’t know what time it closes but if you don’t get there until 1130 you risk not getting a tattoo because the queue will be hours long by then. Reply Katia says 07/30/2014 at 749 am Thanks for you reply … i really hope to be there in time. have a nice day thank you Reply Anonymous says 08/07/2014 at 1037 pm I want to do this tattoo so bad but im so scared of getting a disease since they dont used new tools. Reply Kristin says 08/08/2014 at 228 am I’d suggest visiting an ajarn – a monk in training. Reply Veronicka says 08/18/2014 at 655 pm well i’ve been really interested in sak yant and i’ve read alot of different stories of different peoples experiences and i wanted to know how do you deal with the rules” that go with your sak yant and i heard that every year you have to get it reblessed or something like that do you do something like that or no? Thank you and lovely post by the way! Reply Kristin says 08/20/2014 at 518 am That is one of the many rules. There’s a big ceremony each March at the temple where people do this. It’s up to you of course how strict you’ll be with it depending on if it’s aesthetic for you or deeply spiritual and religious. Reply Jessica says 08/24/2014 at 235 pm $4 I couldn’t stop thinking bout that and ya kinda lost me do u think u could spare it! Reply Rich - RichyFeet says 08/25/2014 at 643 pm Wow what a special experience this sounds like. I’ve visited Thai temples and they are amazing spiritual places so can only imagine how this day must have felt. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/02/2014 at 1054 pm It was so spiritual and calming yet exhilarating. Reply Marah Howles says 10/10/2014 at 131 am Nice tattoo dear.. but I was more impressed in the man’s tattoo all over his body. For me I can’t dare to try even a single hit of the tattoo pin in my body.. LOL Reply Karen says 10/16/2014 at 754 am Hi Kristin This was a great article! This has been on my bucket list for quite a long time. I will be in Bankok in a few weeks and would like to have the same experience. However heeding all of your warnings I’m curious about the äftereffects of the tattoo. Did you have any unusual side effects? I have heard that these can sometimes cause trancelike state or reaction to chemicals used in the ink. Reply Kristin says 10/16/2014 at 801 am That didn’t happen with me. I can definitely help you find an ajarn who uses synthetic ink and a clean needle if you’d like though. Feel free to email me addis.kristin@gmail.com Reply Paul Renwick says 10/25/2014 at 212 am You should be ashamed of yourself for donating so little money to the temple for receiving so much in return. Reply Kristin says 10/26/2014 at 444 am Paul they only ask for a 120 baht donation. That’s what everyone pays. They aren’t in it to make money they want to bless people. Did you ever think it might be an insult to put a huge amount of money forth when they’re only asking for a small amount? Why should I pay more than the locals? Because I’m a foreigner? I don’t support that notion. It’s a communal pot and everyone is watching. I think it’s important to better understand the concept before making such remarks. I’ll also point out I was part of a blogger effort that donated thousands of dollars to elephant conservation in Thailand earlier this year. I do help out and give back and certainly realize Thailand has given me very much in return. Reply Kaitlyn says 12/30/2014 at 1156 pm On the Wat Bang Phra temple wikipedia page it says Upon entering the Wat one of the first things a person sees on the wall is a very large banner of tattoos available. Unless there is a specific choice requested the monk will begin with a simple tattoo at the top of the back.” Are you sure you weren’t able to choose your design? I want to get a tattoo here but I want a choice. I wouldn’t think the information on wiki to be incorrect.. Reply Kristin says 12/31/2014 at 1248 pm Am I sure I didn’t choose my design? Yes I’m sure. I don’t lie on my blog. There would be no point in that. I suppose if you can speak Thai you can make a request but everyone I know who has gone had the same experience that I did – the monk chose and there was no discussion. I did see the banner but he doesn’t ask you first if you have something picked out. My friend Ian did show him a photo of a design he wanted and ended up walking out with that tattoo. Of course you lose some of the novelty of the monk choosing for you which I thought was cool. If you want to be able to speak English and choose a design I’d suggest an ajarn. Reply Kaitlyn says 12/31/2014 at 128 pm I wasn’t implying you lied. I asked if you were sure you weren’t able to choose” I wasn’t questioning that you didn’t choose. There was a banner posted on the wiki page so I’m sure some can choose if they are aware they can. Many do allow the monk to choose because that is part of the experience however they have many tattoos to do and I find myself thinking they may choose the smaller designs to get through people quicker. However I haven’t been yet and this may not be the case with all monks. I think I will go with an Ajarn in Chiang Mai. The link you posted for the Ajarn in Bangkok is quite expensive paying $600 USD for a tattoo done by an Ajarn is quite expensive compared to the $3-$5 tattoo done by the monks. Reply Kristin says 01/01/2015 at 1153 am True but I would’t bargain hunt for something that’s on my body forever and I do mention that it’s not a new needle if you go to the monk. I honestly don’t know how easy it is to choose the design. There wasn’t any indication it was a possibility when I was there. It’s also common to go in a sort of order. Best of luck whatever you end up doing. Reply Nicole says 02/03/2015 at 631 am Hi Kristin. I went to Wat Bang Phra January 30th 2015 with my daughter and her friend. My daughter’s friend got a Sak Yant. I don’t know which monk performed it but when it was her turn she did not get to choose the placement or the tattoo she received. Just in case anyone was questioning this. Her Sak Yant was placed on her upper right arm. She gave a donation of 200 baht flowers cigarettes and incense. Reply Kristin says 02/03/2015 at 1021 am Yep I noted that as well in the post. You don’t get to choose. Reply Laurie says 02/11/2015 at 414 am Hello The link you posted to join The disciple is only a PayPal link no adress ! So i would Like to know  before spending 250$ if you might know the place where we can find the monk ? Reply Kristin says 02/11/2015 at 503 am Nope it’s a link to my friend Ian’s website which discusses the session what you can expect and how to book. It’s near Bangkok and he’s the one who knows where the location is. The ajarn is moving towards only accepting bookings through Ian since he has had some people show up who weren’t respectful. Similar problems have arisen at this wat and I feel partially responsible. Due to this I won’t be giving out the address. Reply Hadley says 02/15/2015 at 821 pm Hi Kristin. I saw your 2015 update that the head monk at Wat Bang Phra has switched to a gun but I was wondering if whoever sent you that information gave any indication as to whether or not there are still traditional bamboo needles being done at the temple just by different artists. Thanks! Yours looks incredible. Reply Kristin says 02/16/2015 at 1245 am When I was there he was the only one giving the tattoos. This was someone who visited the wat and reported back that only a gun tattoo was available. You could still check it out for the experience just to see but that,Promotion

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Klagenfurt - A Charming Town on the Wörthersee Klagenfurt - A Charming Town on the Wörthersee Since we had visited Zagreb during Christmas time one year ago this time we decided to pay a visit to Klagenfurt located on the Wörthersee. We went on a two-day trip so we could experience the town gleaming in the evening light and shine in the morning sun. We spent the night at the Youth Hostel Klagenfurt Jugendgästehaus Klagenfurt. 441 steps to a wonderful view Our first stop was the Pyramidenkogel observation tower located on top of the Pyramidenkogel mountain. We followed the street arrows and arrived at a full parking lot it was Saturday so we headed back to the valley and parallel parked by the road. There’s a café a public bathroom and a ticket office at the ground floor of the tower. We bought the tickets and walked up the steel spiral staircase 70 metres high. We could already see the beautiful surroundings on our way up but the panoramic view from the top was really magnificent. From there you can see Slovenian hills the nearby town of Villach and the entire lake Wörthersee. We wanted to go down the slide but unfortunately it was closed because of the cold. For an additional price of 4 euros visitors can slide down a spiral tunnel on a sledge. The slide shoots down 120 metres. A great adventure full of adrenaline. But no matter we were thrilled by the tower and the view. The next night when we were driving back to Slovenia we could see the tower above the forest illuminated in different colours in our rear-view mirror. As beautiful as a rainbow! Exploring the town Wörthersee Mandl and the coats-of-arms We went to a hostel with an excellent location because of its proximity to the popular Minimundus and the town centre which is located just 3 km away. The staff kindly took care of us. You can find more information at Hostel Klagenfurt. Afterwards it was time to explore the town. Because it was Saturday we didn’t have any trouble finding a parking spot since parking charges in the blue parking zones only apply during the weekdays. We parked and went for a walk. Narrow streets cobblestone paths terraced houses and colourful facades are the reasons why we grew fond of the town so fast. We were greeted by a dragon in the town centre Neuer Platz. It is actually a fountain with bronze statues of a dragon and Hercules Lindwurmbrunnen that tells the legend of the town’s origin. Right around the corner in the neighbouring street where multiple paths converge we were impressed by the coats-of-arms in the ground representing the twin towns of Klagenfurt. Then we quickly caught the sight Mandl a legendary figure who is believed to have created the lake Wörthersee if local imagination is to be believed. The inauguration – an important historical heritage Afterwards we went to see the Prince’s Stone. Yes the same one that was used for the ducal inauguration in the Middle Ages and on which the duke swore an oath in German and assumed power. The Prince’s Stone is on display at the Landhaus situated between Alter Platz and Heiligengeistplatz. It’s not difficult to find the building since it stands out among the other buildings with its two onion-shaped domes and arcaded courtyard. This is undoubtedly the most visited building in this part of Austria thanks to the original Prince’s Stone relocated from the Wörthersee that is stored in a hall with baroque ceiling paintings and walls that exhibit 665 coats-of-arms. The coats-of-arms were custom painted by a baroque painter from Carinthia at the request of various princes and royal families. It was getting dark so we decided to go out for dinner and ordered hot punch and chocolate-covered fruit in one of the cafés. Yummy! It’s something one can’t do without during winter. Coffee served with sunshine at the Wörthersee After the breakfast we continued exploring the town centre. We carried our luggage to the car and drove to the town again where we parked and let the streets guide us. We quickly found our way around town as it is quick and easy to navigate despite being a big town. We like walking among the colourful facades admiring them having long conversations and guessing what the flats look like on the other side as well as being impressed by display windows. Sweets tempted us to visit a café. We spent the afternoon at the Wörthersee. The azure lake was breathtaking and if it hadn’t been winter we would have definitely jumped into the water. Instead we treated ourselves to some coffee served with sunshine on a restaurant terrace and decided to visit Klagenfurt in the summer as well. Wörthersee is the largest lake in the Austrian state of Carinthia. The lake’s surface area is 19.39 km² and the lake reaches a maximum depth of 82.5 m. Klagenfurt is a charming town and its town centre easily navigatable. There isn’t any need to use public transport. You can walk the enchanting streets on foot and admire the beautiful buildings. The town is charming all year round and is suitable for tourists families with small children and seniors. On warm days the town offers a pleasant cycling or walking experience around the lake. If you are visiting the town with children paying a visit to the miniature world the Minimundus is definitely the greatest experience. A must-see for castle enthusiasts is the Hochosterwitz Castle with a mystic path leading to it which runs through 14 gates”. Maybe a less known destination but still interesting enough to add to your list of places to visit is the birth house of Josef Stefan.

5ee0b8692daea00f6d45bcaa,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/gulhane-park,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapCyclingEventsBlogGallery MENU Gülhane Park Gardens Of Topkapı Palace HomeDestinationsGülhane Park Gülhane means the House of Roses and is located in the gardens of Topkapı Palace. Once only accessible to the royal court is now open to the public. It is the oldest and one of the largest public parks in Istanbul. The Sur-i Sultani within the Royal Walls includes not only the buildings that have stood witness to important episodes in world history but also beautiful landscaped gardens. The first of those gardens is Gülhane Rosehouse Park. Today the tulip is a flower mainly associated with other countries. Perhaps in your mind too tulips are identified with other countries. However you should know that the first tulip bulbs were sent abroad from İstanbul in the Ottoman Period. The tulip has even lent its name to the most controversial era of Ottoman history. If you visit İstanbul in season you will find tulips in bloom in Gülhane Park – a wonderful haven for those trying to escape from summer heat a place where you can enjoy sea breezes under the cool shade of centuries-old trees. The park also has a panoramic view of the Sea of Marmara the Golden Horn and the İstanbul Strait as it is situated on the tip of the historical peninsula. The park is also associated with the Tanzimat reorganisation of the state reforms since the Rescript of Gülhane was proclaimed here. The Tanzimat Museum which exhibits documents and photographs relating to that important period of the Ottoman Empire is situated in Gülhane Park. The Has Ahırlar Royal Stables is a part of Gülhane Park and at present they house the Islamic Science and Technology Museum. The museum exhibits replicas built according to written records of various devices and tools invented and developed by Islamic scientists between the 8th and 16th centuries. Among them are the world map designed by 70 geographers and astronomers in a thirty-year period in 9th century and the oldest clock of the world that works in accordance with the time system which is still in use. We recommend a visit to the museum for an insight into the contribution of scientists from the Islamic world to the world history of science.

This is a town which is rich in history and art set in the agricultural landscape of Siena the ideal place to relax but also to live in contact with nature surrounded by gentle hills covered with olive groves vineyards and forests of pine and chestnut trees. Its History Montepulciano with its ancient Etruscan and Roman origins - according to legend it was founded by king Porsena -  was long disputed between Florence and Siena. From the fifteenth to the sixteenth century the town was the centre of a great cultural and artistic fervour which not only saw the presence of great humanists such as the poet Angelo Poliziano but also the building of splendid churches and mansions by great architects such as Antonio da Sangallo Jacopo Barozzi and Baldassare Peruzzi. Nowadays Montepulciano is very attractive to tourists thanks to its characteristic urban structure to the famous cultural events which it leads but also thanks to the magnificent vineyards that surround it and which yield the excellent Vino Nobile of Montepulciano DOCG controlled and warranted designation of origin. What to see A fortress looks down over the old town of Montepulciano where on the beautiful Piazza Grande you can admire the Town Hall built in the fourteenth century and the seventeenth-century cathedral also known as the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta. The recumbent statue of Bartolomeo Aragazzi by Michelozzo together with an Assumption by Taddeo di Bartolo may also be admired inside the three-nave cathedral. Palazzo Tarugi completely covered in travertine also overlooks the square. We would also like to point out Piazza delle Erbe the monumental and isolated church of San Biagio also known as the Temple and that of St. Augustine Palazzo Cervini designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and the Civic Museum which displays beautiful masterpieces of Sienese and Florentine art. Events which shouldn’t be missed Famous for its ancient traditions every year Montepulciano renews its folklore with spectacular events. Beginning with the Bravio delle botti The barrel contest a competition between districts which takes place in the streets of the city. Do not miss the spectacular Bruscello Poliziano popular Tuscan traditional theatrical shows which have been repeated every year in the Cathedral churchyard since 1939. The Nobile of Montepulciano wine Montepulciano and the hilly clay areas on the edge of the Valdichiana plain such as Valiano the Abbey of Montepulciano SantAlbino Argiano San Gavino Gracciano are the area of production of the Vino Nobile of Montepulciano. The grape that characterizes this aristocratic wine is the Prugnolo Gentile. The Consorzio of Vino Nobile and several major wineries are based here in Montepulciano including the Cantina del Redi directly connected to the roof terrace of Palazzo Ricci.

Comment /05/15/2020 Share To learn more about what I went through in Africa read part 1 part 2 and part 3. After a long journey through South Africa we have finally arrived at the last destination of my African trip 2014. Victoria Falls at Livingstone Zambia is the place I chose as my final entry to the Solo Travelers Journal for Africa. The reason I chose Africa was to see this mighty waterfall with my own 2 eyes and now from experiencing it first hand I can say it was worth the long hours flight from Bangkok. What is so special about this place? Everything. The sound roaring across the cliffs dividing Zimbabwe and Zambia the strong current that even avid adventurers will be scared to jump in the generally friendly people of Zambia and the opportunity to jump off a 110m high bridge overlooking the Victoria Falls. What more can you ask for a 4 days getaway in Africa? Still not convinced? Scroll down and see for yourself. Note Before you enter Zambia you need to be Yellow-Fever vaccinated and you will be required to prove this at the airport with the yellow booklet the doctor gave you. They will ask for it. Check out the previous post of this Africa seriesVisiting Blyde River Canyon South Africa Table of Contents Africa Travel Video Where to Stay in Livingstone Zambia 1. Witness the Lunar Rainbow 2. Visit the Victoria Falls on the Zambian Side 3. Hike Down to The Boiling Pot at Victoria Falls 4. Bungee Jump off the Victoria Falls Bridge 5. Cruise Along the Zambezi River Africa Travel Video Where to Stay in Livingstone Zambia As I arrived at the airport I was picked up by a driver from the hostel I stayed the Jollyboy Backpacker Lodge. This place is one of the best hostels Ive stayed so far. The photo above shows a very cozy common area where people come and socialize and of course use wifi. This is the place where I met Bonnie a British lady who suggested me to take a night trip to the falls right away and experience the lunar rainbow a natural phenomenon that only happens during the full moon. I met up with Wade a South African friend I tagged along with to go see the Lunar rainbow. 1. Witness the Lunar Rainbow Me and Wade grab a taxi at 7 pm and there we went to the Fall. We walked around in the dark trying to get the best spot of the falls and the lunar rainbow. After waiting for a couple of minutes for the clouds to go away and let the full moon shined at the Fall the rainbow started to appear. That was my first glance at the fall an impressive one for sure. That night I met up with a couple of guys and girls at the Jollyboys bar. They were having a couple of beers grilling braais African barbecue and were about to head out to a local bar called Fez. And off I went with them ended up competing in a couple of beer pong tournament and returned to the hostel at 2 AM. Slept like a baby. 2. Visit the Victoria Falls on the Zambian Side As most of my friend went camping at one of the park under a gigantic baobab tree in the very early morning I decided to dedicate this day to the Victoria Falls. I went out at 10 AM and arranged my taxi to pick me up at 5 PM. The Victoria Falls during the day are even more impressive! I found a pretty isolated spot at the top of the fall where I sat and watch the violent current of the Zambezi river. It was April and the water level was at all-time high. Surprisingly I found solitude in the chaos of the current watching each stream hit one another while the falls roared like thunders. Because of the height of the falls and the level of the water during that time the contact between the falls and the river down below caused a shower as high as the fall itself and even higher. Same spot as the night before but during the day. Stunning to matter the time. In my hand was a raincoat I prepared for the shower. Turned out it was not enough to withstand the raw power of nature. There was a bridge that goes right under the shower and I was completely soaked by the time I was halfway on the bridge. I quickly grab my camera and took this picture just to show you how powerful it was. This is the amount of water during April. It was crazy and awesome at the same time. This is the bridge that crossed between the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. This is also the place where people casually jump off to test their bravery and soon tested mine as well. 3. Hike Down to The Boiling Pot at Victoria Falls Before jumping I decided to survey the area and went to the bottom of the falls. It was a couple of minutes walk down the falls and I was able to put the height of the fall into perspective as I watched people almost plunged to their death as the bungee cord saved them right before they are crushed against the crazy current of the Zambezi river. I started to feel something in my stomach at this point. Even as I walked further away from the fall I can still see the shower blowing outward. It was mind boggling. I decided to sit at the bottom of the fall to dry myself before doing the bungee jump. It was a breathtaking view. Someone just jumped off the bridge and in a few moments that would be me! On the far left was the bridge I mentioned earlier. I barely saw the fall up to this point and yet I still felt the power of it. It was really crazy to think that such amount of water flow like this all day all night. As I walked back to the entrance the same way I came in to go out to the bungee jump bridge I took another shot at the falls this time to capture the full height of it. The little orange dot at the bottom was where I was a minute ago. As I walked to the bridge my heart sunk as I saw this. The bungee jumping seems like a bad idea at this point. Damn.. maybe I should just watch.. 4. Bungee Jump off the Victoria Falls Bridge At the end of the day my excitement trumped my fear and so after I ask for bungee jump pass at the immigration I had lunch registered for the jump and went for it. The Zambezi river from the no mans land bridge. And there it was the platform where my body will free fall for 100 m straight down to the violent river of the falls. After the instructor strapped me with hooks and they filmed my jump I had to act like I didnt scare but to tell you the truth I was scared shitless. After they made sure everything are in place they directed me to the edge count down from 3 and there I went. This was the moment when my body started to reject my action. It felt that something was wrong so it tried to convince me not to do it but it was all too late. Everything happened so fast it was impossible to realize what was happening. The first fall was already scary but the second free fall after the first bounce was as scary as well. The feeling afterward was so awesome I got rainbows shooting out of my ass.  After the jump I simply sat and watch the sunset at the falls feeling all proud of the things Ive done. It was a moment of epiphany. 5. Cruise Along the Zambezi River On this last full day in Zambia I decided to give myself a break and learn more about the people I hung out with at the hostel. We chilled out at the common area the whole day talking and in the evening I Wade and a couple of guys went on a sunset booze cruise at the Zambezi river. We had braais for dinner as usual together with unlimited booze. We drank and we talked and drank some more. It was a great epilogue to my glorious African trip. Sunset and sunrise in Africa never disappoint. And this was the last sunset I experienced in Zambia.. for now. On the last day I packed everything ready to leave and as I was about to leave I decided to go for a little stroll with Bonnie had one final Mosi beer at the locals watering hole and flew back to JoBurg. I ended up sleeping at the nearest hotel at the airport and headed back to Bangkok. And thats the end of my 10 days first contact with Africa. The place and the people there left me impressed and I assure you this will not be my last time. I hope you enjoy this little photo essay and if you are planning a trip to South Africa and Zambia and you need help please do let me know in the comment below. Next up Ill be heading to Singapore for a few days to conclude my 10th country traveling alone in one year. Time flies isnt it? It felt like yesterday when I took the leap of faith and traveled to Cambodia alone.

The most celebrated myths of ancient Athens its greatest religious festivals earliest cults and several decisive events in the citys history are all connected to this sacred precinct. The monuments of the Acropolis stand in harmony with their natural setting. These unique masterpieces of ancient architecture combine different orders and styles of Classical art in a most innovative manner and have influenced art and culture for many centuries. The Acropolis of the fifth century BC is the most accurate reflection of the splendour power and wealth of Athens at its greatest peak the golden age of Perikles. Pottery sherds of the Neolithic period 4000/3500-3000 BC and from near the Erechtheion of the Early and Middle Bronze Age show that the hill was inhabited from a very early period. A fortification wall was built around it in the thirteenth century BC and the citadel became the centre of a Mycenaean kingdom. This early fortification is partially preserved among the later monuments and its history can be traced fairly accurately. The Acropolis became a sacred precinct in the eighth century BC with the establishment of the cult of Athena Polias whose temple stood at the northeast side of the hill. The sanctuary flourished under Peisistratos in the mid-sixth century BC when the Panathinaia the citys greatest religious festival was established and the first monumental buildings of the Acropolis erected among them the so-called Old temple” and the Hekatompedos the predecessor of the Parthenon both dedicated to Athena. The shrine of Artemis Brauronia and the first monumental propylon also date to this period. Numerous opulent votive offerings such as marble korai and horsemen bronze and terracotta statuettes were dedicated to the sanctuary. Several of these bear inscriptions that show the great importance of Athenas cult in the Archaic period. After the Athenians defeated the Persians at Marathon in 490 BC they began building a very large temple the so-called Pre-Parthenon. This temple was still unfinished when the Persians invaded Attica in 480 BC pillaged the Acropolis and set fire to its monuments. The Athenians buried the surviving sculptures and votive offerings inside natural cavities of the sacred rock thus forming artificial terraces and fortified the Acropolis with two new walls the wall of Themistokles along the northern side and that of Kimon on the south. Several architectural elements of the ruined temples were incorporated in the northern wall and are still visible today. In the mid-fifth century BC when the Acropolis became the seat of the Athenian League and Athens was the greatest cultural centre of its time Perikles initiated an ambitious building project which lasted the entire second half of the fifth century BC. Athenians and foreigners alike worked on this project receiving a salary of one drachma a day. The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today - that is the Parthenon the Propylaia the Erechtheion and the Τemple of Athena Nike were erected during this period under the supervision of the greatest architects sculptors and artists of their time. The temples on the north side of the Acropolis housed primarily the earlier Athenian cults and those of the Olympian gods while the southern part of the Acropolis was dedicated to the cult of Athena in her many qualities as Polias patron of the city Parthenos Pallas Promachos goddess of war Ergane goddess of manual labour and Nike Victory. After the end of the Peloponnesian war in 404 BC and until the first century BC no other important buildings were erected on the Acropolis. In 27 BC a small temple dedicated to Augustus and Rome was built east of the Parthenon. In Roman times although other Greek sanctuaries were pillaged and damaged the Acropolis retained its prestige and continued to attract the opulent votive offerings of the faithful. Αfter the invasion of the Herulians in the third century AD a new fortification wall was built with two gates on the west side. One of these the so-called Beulé Gate named after the nineteenth century French archaeologist who investigated it is preserved to this day. In subsequent centuries the monuments of the Acropolis suffered from both natural causes and human intervention. After the establishment of Christianity and especially in the sixth century AD the temples were converted into Christian churches. The Parthenon was dedicated to Parthenos Maria the Virgin Mary was later re-named Panagia Athiniotissa Virgin of Athens and served as the citys cathedral in the eleventh century. The Erechtheion was dedicated to the Sotiras Saviour or the Panagia the Temple of Athena Nike became a chapel and the Propylaia an episcopal residence. The Acropolis became the fortress of the medieval city. Under Frankish occupation 1204-1456 the Propylaia were converted into a residence for the Frankish ruler and in the Ottoman period 1456-1833 into the Turkish garrison headquarters. The Venetians under F. Morozini besieged the Acropolis in 1687 and on September 26th bombarded and destroyed the Parthenon which then served as a munitions store. Lord Elgin caused further serious damage in 1801-1802 by looting the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon the temple of Athena Nike and the Erechtheion. The Acropolis was handed over to the Greeks in 1822 during the Greek War of Independence and Odysseas Androutsos became its first Greek garrison commander. After the liberation of Greece the monuments of the Acropolis came under the care of the newly founded Greek state. Limited investigation took place in 1835 and 1837 while in 1885-1890 the site was systematically excavated under P. Kavvadias. In the early twentieth century N. Balanos headed the first large-scale restoration project. A Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments on the Acropolis was created in 1975 with the aim to plan and undertake large-scale conservation and restoration on the Acropolis. The project conducted by the Service of Restoration of the Monuments of the Acropolis in collaboration with the First Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities is still in progress. Description The naturally fortified site of the Acropolis is accessible only from the west. Both the Mycenaean fortress and ancient sanctuary were accessed from here just like the modern archaeological site is today. The hill was first fortified in the Mycenaean period and traces of this early wall are still visible particularly to the southeast of the Propylaia. The walls visible to this day were erected after the Persian Wars in the first half of the fifth century BC under Themistokles north wall and Kimon south wall. Alterations were made under Perikles and again in later times when the Acropolis became the stronghold of the city. The sacred rock is approached from the West through the Beulé gate one of the two gates built after the third century AD Herulian invasion or through a small door under the temple of Athena Nike. The visitor then approaches the Propylaia the monumental entrance to the sanctuary built in Classical times by architect Mnesikles. The temple of Athena Nike built c. 420 BC by Kallikrates dominates the bastion to the south of the Propylaia. Near the temple was the shrine of Aphrodite Pandemos of which only part of the epistyle is preserved. Opposite the north wing of the Propylaia is a tall rectangular pedestal known as the pedestal of Agrippas because it once supported an offering by the city of Athens to Marcus Agrippas son-in-law of Augustus. Through the Propylaia one enters the sanctuary proper with its great masterpieces of ancient Greek architecture built primarily in the fifth century under Perikles. The Parthenon the hallmark of ancient Greek civilization is indeed the most imposing of all. Dedicated to Athena Parthenos it was erected under Perikles replacing two earlier temples dedicated to the same goddess. Between the Parthenon and the Propylaia along the south wall carved on bedrock are the traces of two buildings of the fifth century BC the Brauronion a shrine dedicated to Artemis Brauronia and the Chalkotheke a building that once contained votive offerings of bronze. East of the Parthenon is a small circular temple of 27 BC dedicated to Augustus and Rome. At the highest point on the east side of the hill carved on bedrock are the traces of the shrine of Zeus Polieus while the current museum occupies the site of a shrine dedicated to the local hero Pandion. On the north side of the hill is the Erechtheion the Ionic temple of Athena and Poseidon-Erechtheus with its famous porch of the Karyatides. Along the south wall of the Erechtheion are the foundations of the Old Temple the sixth century Doric temple of Athena Polias destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC repaired and finally burnt down in 406 BC. Northwest of the Erechtheion along the north wall of the Acropolis is the Arrhephorion a small square building where the Arrhephoroi lived. These young women weaved the peplos of the goddess for the Panathenaic festival and took part in initiation rituals. The sacred rock was dedicated to the goddess Athena but its slopes were taken over by various other cults. A number of caves on the precipitous northern slope were used as shrines and were approached by a peripatos or path one kilometre long which surrounded the rocky crag all the way to the southern slope with its many shrines and other important monuments. connect and experience Download Banners Download Wallpapers Download Guides Download Brochures Download Maps Download Photos Sign up to our newsletter explore Greece by interest Culture Leisure Touring Gastronomy Activities Religious Meetings City Break useful info Sea Routes A.I.A.

It is spread on the last hills of the Pálava Mountains and surrounded with vineyards. This is the centre of the Mikulov vineyard sub-area and wine is everywhere – in the scenic historical streets and in the chateau. Come visit the beautiful Mikulov! Download guides and brochure Address Tourist Information Centre Mikulov Náměstí 1 692 01 Mikulov GPS 48.8073156833131 16.631240844726562 Phone +420 519 510 855 tic@mikulov.cz www.mikulov.cz More info www.rmm.cz Read More The historical town of Mikulov is in South Moravia only a few kilometres away from Brno near the border of the Czech Republic and Austria. And like all the towns and villages in South Moravia Mikulov is also surrounded by vineyards. It is the warmest area in the Czech Republic where vines are doing very well and where wine-growing has a centuries-long tradition. Mikulov was founded at the beginning of the 12th century upon the establishment of a market settlement which was promoted to a town in 1410. The Baroque chateau was built in the 17th century instead of the Romanesque and Gothic castle. Mikulov was owned by the Lichtenstein family from the end of the 13th century to the end of the 16th century and then by the Ditrichstein family until the 19th century. The Ditrichstein family owned the chateau and the local farm estate until 1945 when the chateau burned out. When you go on a tour of the chateau you will walk through history. For example the preliminary conditions of truce between France and Austria were negotiated there after the Battle of Slavkov on 2 December 1805. What not to miss The Baroque chateau is the dominant of Mikulov and is now also the seat of the Regional Museum of Mikulov where you can find the most extensive domestic exposition on wine-growing and wine-making including a unique giant wine barrel. The picture gallery will remind you of the Dichtristein family under whose reign the town flourished for several centuries. You should also visit the chateau library and the Romans and Germans in the Region under Pálava exposition which talks about the inhabitants of the region two thousand years ago. Mikulov legend Cardinal Ditrichstein is forever included in the history of Mikulov as according to legend he stopped the frisky fun that took place on a hill called Tanzberg in 1622. It was a year of the plague epidemic and the Cardinal had the Chapel of St. Sebastian built on the hill to express his gratitude. The hill has been called Svatý kopeček Holy Hill ever since and you can get there from the town along the early Baroque Stations of the Cross with chapels. The Ditrichstein tomb is in the former Church of St. Anna on the main square in Mikulov.

Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 34shares One of the most beautiful corners of British Columbia Vancouver offers a huge range of things to do and places to see. So after our first few months of living in Victoria and with some help from some blogger friends here are some of our favourite Vancouver Island places to visit. This post may contain compensated affiliate links. For more info please see our full disclosure here! Places to Visit on Vancouver Island Often overlooked in favour of its name-sake larger city over on the mainland we should perhaps point out first of all that Vancouver Island is not where you’ll find Vancouver. It’s also not a small island by any stretch of the imagination and has more than enough to keep any bucket list filled. With a population of under a million people which swells in summer Vancouver Island is for the most part sparsely populated and covers a huge 32000 square kilometre area. To put things into perspective the island runs parallel from south of Vancouver city on the mainland all the way along to northern British Columbia. Home to rich Indigenous / First Nations culture an abundance of forest and wildlife both on land and in the water Canada’s best surfing spot some of the region’s most beautiful smaller islands and not to mention the best high tea in Canada it’s not really about the reasons to visit Vancouver Island. The question is why haven’t you been here already?! Although we’ve only been living Island life for a few months we are constantly overwhelmed by the beauty of Vancouver Island and frequently reminded as to how grateful we should be to experience life here. The Best Time to Visit Vancouver Island Peak season for visiting Vancouver Island is during the summer months with the school holidays in July and August attracting most visitors from within Canada and beyond. If you can try to visit outside those weeks and you’ll find slightly lower prices and better availability for hotels/accommodation. May-June and September are great months to visit Vancouver Island too as the season winds down the weather is still hopefully sunny and the leaves start to change into their beautiful fall glory. For whale watching on Vancouver island the best time to visit is between May and October. Pods of Orca live in the warmish! waters south of Victoria and around the Gulf islands while various types of whale including grey whales Minke whales and dolphins pass through the waters around the island. The Salmon Run can be seen in late summer from Campbell River. Fall is a great time to see the colours and to enjoy storm watching off Tofino we were surprised to learn that storm-watching is a thing in the UK we just normally hide from the rain - and there are some good deals to be had at this time too. Getting to and Around Vancouver Island Victoria has a small international airport with flights to Calgary Vancouver and Seattle but if you’re flying in from overseas it will be much cheaper to land in Vancouver than in Victoria on the island. For an unforgettable experience Harbour Air runs seaplane/floatplane flights between Victoria inner harbour and Vancouver’s coal harbour as well as to Whistler and other towns on Vancouver Island. If you arrive in Vancouver you can continue by sea on the BC Ferries service from Vancouver to Victoria. Note that it runs from Tsawassanen which is about an hour south of Vancouver to Swartz Bay which is a similar distance from downtown Victoria. For travelling around Vancouver Island you will need a car. Victoria offers a basic bus service but it’s hard to get to many nearby attractions without your own wheels. You can rent a car on the mainland and bring it over on BC Ferries but make sure you reserve your ferry spots ahead of time in the summer or you can rent a car once you are on the island in Victoria. Vancouver Island Map The Best Places to Visit on Vancouver Island The Parliament Buildings Victoria Victoria Victoria is Vancouver Island’s main city and the administrative capital of British Columbia. Located on the far south of Vancouver Island the city is popular for its beautiful harbour British colonial architecture and governmental buildings it still serves as the provincial capital for BC. There’s plenty of reasons to stay in Victoria – its iconic hotels tasty bakeries and restaurants and for some downtime between museum hopping or heading out to watch wildlife. Victoria is one of the most popular spots for whale watching tours in spring and summer and we highly recommend heading out on a whale watching trip. Victoria is a popular destination in summer so book well ahead for the best deals. Where to Stay in Victoria The Empress Hotel High End – For those looking to experience an icon look no further than the Empress. This classic hotel run by Fairmont is one of Canada’s most iconic and has beautiful views out over Victoria’s harbour so you can watch the seaplanes take off and land from your room.

The Craigmyle Mid Range – Set away from Victoria’s harbour font in the beautiful residential area of Fairfield the Craigmyle is a chance to experience historic Victoria in a warm grand house turned hotel.

Tracy’s Travels in Time The Butchart Gardens Contributed by Tracy’s Travels in Time – read more about their trip to the Butchart Gardens here. One of our favourite places to visit on Vancouver Island is Butchart Gardens. Created over 100 years ago by Jennie Butchart in a former quarry the gardens are wonderful to visit. I highly recommend adding them into your itinerary. Spread over 55 acres the colourful displays of flowers attract over 1 million visitors every year. As well as the beautiful flowers there are numerous gardens to visit too. The sunken garden is the most iconic. Admire the views of the shrubs flowers lawns and trees before descending into the garden itself. During the months of June and August enjoy the hundreds of roses which bloom in the rose garden. Pose for a picture under the Rose Arch and enjoy the scent as you wander the paths. The Japanese garden and Italian and Mediterranean gardens are also not to be missed. If you are visiting during the summer months a firework display is held every Saturday night. This is a popular event so make sure to claim your seat on the firework lawn before the show begins. I recommend visiting the gardens before heading to the concert lawn for some live entertainment and refreshments and then moving over to the firework lawn before the show. Expect the show to start after dark which can be after 10 pm. Also take a blanket to sit on! Butchart Gardens has something to offer visitors whatever the season and was one of the highlights of our trip to Vancouver Island. Compare and book tours to Butchart Gardens from Victoria or Vancouver here! Tofino from above – Image c. The Coastal Campaign Tofino Contributed by the Coastal Campaign – read about their trip to the Tofino hot springs here. A visit to the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island is a must for any visitor. Tofino is one of the most beautiful towns in Canada and epitomises everything that is great about Vancouver Island. There are numerous stunning beaches dotted along the Tofino coastline and the water is usually full of enthusiastic surfers trying to catch some waves. If you don’t fancy jumping into the icy cold water then simply walk the long sandy beaches to take in the scenic landscapes and natural beauty of the area. Cox Bay is a local favourite and one of the most popular beaches in the area. As well as having the most consistent waves for the surfers there is also a cool hike at the South end of the beach that offers an aerial lookout of the surrounding beaches and islands. Once you have had your fill of the beaches head into the hippy inspired town where there is plenty of good food and drink on offer. Tofino Brewing Co brews amazing beer and you can visit the brewery and try all of the local beers on site. Then enjoy a meal on the patio of The Hatch pub which is a part of Tofino Resort and Marina. The patio is right on the water and has great views of Strawberry Island and the surrounding mountains. The best place to stay in Tofino is at Long Beach Lodge.

There are several operators offering wildlife tours including Ocean Outfitters and Clayoquot Wild Cathedral Grove Contributed by Holidays from Hels Cathedral Grove in MacMillan Provincial Park covers a small area but is famous for being big. It is home to some of the most magnificent specimens of Red Cedar and Douglas Fir in the world. Cathedral Grove derives its name from the way that the sun streams through the canopy above reminiscent of illuminated church windows. Stroll for about 30 minutes along a soft pine strewn path amongst the giants. The route is signposted and easy to follow.

From there it was pretty much non-descript highways. The big difference we observed driving during this trip is the great condition of all the roads and bridges. Everything looks new and all are free from litter. Our first stop today was Colmar France. The old town of Colmar is called Le Petite Venice. It was a gorgeous district crammed with camera ready buildings decked with flowers. The houses wander down the calm canal that wind through the area. We stopped for lunch at a small Brasserie which sold our favorite baquette sandwiches. Leaving Colmar we arrived at our destination Strasbourg mid afternoon and checked into the hotel. The front desk said they were upgrading our rooms and we were all thrilled at what we found. We were in the loft villa area in five star rooms. Not sure why we got them but it was great. We headed right out and purchased tickets for the Batorama a narrative cruise on the canals that weaved through Strasbourg. The cruise which was about an hour long gave a complete Leaving Interlaken history of the city and explained all of the different architecture we were seeing and the German influence on it. Strasbourg has much to offer with its many museums cathedral Notre Dame the les petite France neighborhood with its small twisting back streets lined with half-timber houses adorned with their flower boxes. Of course Diane and I had to venture into some of the shops to check out their goods. Dinner was at a small local restaurant recommended by the petite jeune fille  at the front desk. We all ordered the Coq-au-vin and some local wine then headed back to the hotel to ready ourselves for another big day tomorrow. PS.
