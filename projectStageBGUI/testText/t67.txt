The city which has a population of 5000 is one of the oldest on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and one of the countryâ€™s most popular seaside resorts.
The romantic atmosphere of the cityâ€™s beautiful old town attracts visitors from all over the world.
Archeological research indicates that the city has a 7000 years old cultural tradition.
The first settlement grew up on the Sozopol bay during the Neolithic Era some 6000 years BCE.
In 610 BCE the inhabitants of Milet a city in Asia Minor made the Sozopol peninsula their city-state and called it Apolloniya.
The city-state enjoyed rapid growth during the first centuries of its existence.
In the 5th century BCE massive fortress walls were constructed to protect its monumental public buildings.
Ancient writers describe The Temple of Apollo the Healer as colossal housing a 13-meter high statue of the god.
In 72 BCE Apollonia was conquered by Roman legions commanded by Marcus Lucullus who razed and plundered the city.
The legendary statue of Apollo was removed to Rome as spoils of war.
During the 1st century the city was rebuilt and when Thrace became a Roman province Sozopol continued to function as an administrative maritime center.
When Christianity was accepted as the official state religion Apolloniya was rechristened Sozopolis in keeping with the new Christian dogma.
In the 5th century the city was again fortified by new protective walls remnants of which remain to the present day and can be seen at the southeastern end of the peninsula.
The city was first incorporated into Bulgaria when the army of Han Krum occupied it in 812.
Sozopol became an important diocese with more than 20 Orthodox churches and 5 monasteries.
Remains of the Saint Ivan Saint John monastery complex dating from the X-XII century are still preserved as are the Medieval basilica in the city center and part of the Holy Apostles Monastery on Skamniy Rocky Point in the northeastern part of the Old Town.
Sozopolâ€™s Old Town was declared a museum-reserve by Ministerial Decree â„– 320 on September 7 1974.
The reserve includes more than 180 residences constructed from the middle of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century.
Houses in the Old Town are built of stone and wood and conform to the so-called Black Sea school of architecture.
The best known are The Marieta Stefanova House The Kreanoolu House The Todor Zagorov House The Kurtidi House and The Dimitri Laskaridis House among others.
Two of Sozopolâ€™s most attractive tourist destinations are the cityâ€™s archeological museum and art gallery.
In 2010 during archeological excavations of the nearby Saint Ivan Saint Johnâ€™s Island researchers unearthed holy relics of Saint John the Baptist.
Today these invaluable relics are in the care of authorities at The St.
Cyril and St.
Methodius Church and attract pilgrims from all over the world.
Old Sozopol and the relics of Saint John the Baptist were voted the most important of Bulgariaâ€™s Wondersâ€? in 2011.
