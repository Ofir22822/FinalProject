Kate arrived this morning after her overnight bus trip ready to go on our Montserrat Tapas & Wine Tasting tour.
This started in Plaza Catalunya where we met our guide for the day - Xavi and the rest of our group including Justin from Chigago! Then a bus ride to Monistrol about an hour north west from Barcelona with interesting commentary along the way we were told that we were on the 1/2 day tour 10 to 5.30 as opposed to the full day tour 10 to 7.30?? where we caught the cogwheel train up the mountain to Montserrat.
I chose a tour that included the train as a friend from work had told me how good it was - she failed to mention that the train goes up the side of a cliff!! Spectacular views on the 15 minute journey.
Xavi then gave us a guided tour of the Montserrat site including the Monastery famous for the Black Madonna and its surrounds.
Also includied was a tasting of the liqueur made on site by the nuns not the monks apparently.
There were 4 to taste - mixed herbs very ordinary but Kate & View from the train Can see the snow capped Pyrenees in the background Maurice liked it walnut I thought this one was nice hazelnut and cream the last one was a bit like Baileys and also nice.
Then some sweet bread like foccacia with sugar on top to soak up the alcohol! We passed the queue to touch the Black Madonna on the way into the abbey and then Xavi was keen to point out inside the abbey the chandelier that had been donated by FC Barcelona.
Then as Xavi was keen to point out we had a whole hour of free time.
Maurice and Kate chose to walk to the Cross of San Miguel which we had seen when we got off the train 20 mins each way.
I decided to check out the farmers market locally produced cheese mostly goat and honey.
Then made my way back to the abbey to hear the choir sing at 1pm Maurice & Kate made it in time as well.
The boys choir LEscolania - one of the oldest in Europe were very good.
Then the bus took us to Oller Del Mas an organic winery in Manresa north of Montserrat for a winery tour and tasting.
There was still small amounts of Cross Looking at the cross from outside the Abbey snow on the side of the road as we went down the mountain.
The winery is housed in a restored 10th century castle and we first had cheese and wine outside this was my favourite wine - made from Picapolls grapes - apparently a regional specialty.
Then through the winery up and down lots of stairs - always my favourite to our Tapas and Tasting.
Tapas were nice 4 savoury 1 sweet wine not so nice 1 white 2 red but a fun time with Xavi educating and amusing us the whole time.
Back in Barcelona by 5.30pm - because it was the 1/2 day tour we headed for Placa Reial for dinner but not till 8.30pm because apparently lunch in Spain is 2-5pm and dinner not till after 9pm.
Maurice had discovered this square with lots of restaurants and cafes on his morning search for coffee he discovered not much opens till 10am.
We chose an Italian restaurant so dinner was tapas paella and sangria - made perfect sense! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Lyn Ljeread Joined February 16th 2018 Trips 3 Last Login December 15th 2019 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 61 Guestbook 2 Photos 827 Forum Posts 0 blog=1012303 blogger=381121 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1012303 blogger=381121 Advertisement Trips Visiting Kate March 21st 2018 -» April 15th 2018 Canada/US June 6th 2018 -» June 28th 2018 Africa!!
