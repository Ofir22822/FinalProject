Saint John was tortured for a long time and his body then hurled from Charles Bridge in Prague into the River Vltava.
The legend tells that five stars appeared above his head at that moment.
Since that time stars and the number five have been regarded as symbols of this saint.
Discover the Santini code This legend was used ingeniously by the architect Santini who designed the whole church on the floor plan of a five-pointed star.
The symbol of the stars and number five appear in the building countless times.
In the area around the arcade are five gates and five chapels in the church are five altars and on the high altar are five central stars.
The whole complex is literally interwoven with mystical symbols and enigmas.
Experts are to this very day still looking for the entrance to a secret corridor which allegedly led from the church to the monastery in the nearby Å½Ä?Ã¡r Estate.
