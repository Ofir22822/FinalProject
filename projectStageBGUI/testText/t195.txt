Each has stacked-stone or wooden foundations and reconstructed rough-plank construction.
Its enchanting no doubt about it but can be exhausting if you hit a cruise-ship and bus-tour crush.

The archaeological excavations suggest that the quay was once 140m further inland than its present location.
In the early 14th century there were about 30 wooden buildings each usually shared by several stuer trading firms.
They rose two or three stories above the wharf and combined business premises with living quarters and warehouses.
Each building had a crane for loading and unloading ships as well as a schÃ¸tstue large assembly room where employees met and ate.
Do explore further than the frontages facing the harbour as the wooden alleyways inside Bryggen are the most charming a haven for artists and craftspeople there are bijou boutiques at every turn.
The atmosphere of an intimate waterfront community remains intact and losing yourself in Bryggen is one of Bergens greatest pleasures.
