Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Todays World Heritage site dates back to 1745 when Frederick the Great commissioned Sanssouci Palace to be built as his summer residence.
That makes Sanssouci the oldest feature of the palaces and parks of Potsdam and Berlin.
Back in 1989 the soon-to-be-defunct East German government had already applied for UNESCO World Heritage status for the area which also includes Babelsberg Palace and Park Glienicke hunting lodge Sacrow Park and Palace the New Gardens in northern Potsdam with the Marble Palace on the shores of Heiliger See lake and Cecilienhof House where the Potsdam Conference took place in 1945.
Since 1999 the grounds surrounding the Art Nouveau observatory in Babelsberg have also been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site which occupies over 2000 hectares.
Other places worth visiting among Potsdams historical districts include the Russian colony Alexandrowka which is also part of the World Heritage site the Dutch quarter with its red-brick houses the former Bohemian Weavers Quarter and the famous Babelsberg Film Studio.
Since 1911 when film-makers recognised the unique landscapes and buildings of Potsdam as an ideal location films from around the world have been made here.
Works such as The Blue Angel The Pianist Around the World in 80 Days and more recently Inglourious Basterds have all been shot here.
