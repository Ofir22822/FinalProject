Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the Bani Yas in the late 18th century which also assumed control of Dubai.
In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.
Into the mid-20th century the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of Al-Ain and Liwa and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city which was occupied mainly during the summer months.
Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were at this time constructed of palm fronds barasti with the wealthier families occupying mud huts.
The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the twentieth century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.
In 1939 Sheikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan granted petroleum concessions and oil was first found in 1958.
At first oil money had a marginal impact.
A few lowrise concrete buildings were erected and the first paved road was completed in 1961 but Sheikh Shakbut uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last took a cautious approach preferring to save the revenue rather than investing it in development.
His brother Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi.
The ruling Al Nahyan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country.
On August 6 1966 with the assistance of the British Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler.8 With the announcement by the UK in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf area by 1971 Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates.
After the Emirates gained independence in 1971 oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with banks boutiques and modern highrises.
At present Abu Dhabi boasts what is estimated to be the worlds highest absolute and per-capitacitation needed level of sovereign wealth funds calculated at USD 1000000 per a local national inhabitant The United Arab Emirates is located in the oil-rich and strategic Persian Gulf region.
It adjoins the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman.
Abu Dhabi is located in the far west and southwest part of the United Arab Emirates along the southern cost of the Persian Gulf between latitudes 22Â°40â€™ and around 25Â° north and longitudes 51Â° and around 56Â° east.9 The emirate borders the emirate of Dubai and Sharjah to its north.
The total area of the Emirate is 67340 square kilometres occupying about 87% of the total area of the UAE excluding islands.
The territorial waters of the Emirate embrace about 200 islands off its 700 kilometres coastline.
The topography of the Emirate is dominated by low-lying sandy terrain dotted with sand dunes exceeding 300 metres in height in some areas southwards.
The eastern part of the Emirate borders the western fringes of Al-Hajar Mountains.
Hafeet Mountain Abu Dhabiâ€™s highest elevation rising about 1300 metres is located south of Al Ain city.
Good Morning! I apologize for not writing sooner.
There was an immensely long plane ride and then I found tourist stuff to do and a lot of sleeping.
So we arrive in Dubai I got to see the Palm from the plane.
Its even on google maps.
the palm is a man made palm tree looking shaped beach here in Abu Dhabi.
http//www.lonelyplanet.com/united-arab-emirates/dubai/images/marina-dubai$26294-21#content My mother and I checked into the hotel around 1640 and walked around to find a grocery store.
They had mostly American food items and chips.
It was cool seeing Doritos and Cheez balls written in Arabic.
We had dinner at this little restaurant next to the hotel called Cocos which turned out to have the entire menu of TGIFridays.
Fried green beans and all.
* I must mention here the dangers of crossing the streets.
Everyone goes so flippin fast and even if you are at a crosswalk it is best to find one not near a round-a-bout.
There is just so much chaos it is better to walk further down the street and look for a clearing using the left/right/left tactic.
We went back to the hotel and crashed out.
In the morning Sebatian! I went down to the beach and there were so many people in speedos! I still dont know how I feel about that.
I think I still prefer men in swim trunks.
Beautiful beach and they had a sand-snow-man.
The next day we went on a Desert Safari- They picked us up at our hotel and we get into this van and I notice it has roll-bars installed.
My first thought is oh shit they do drive crazy in Saudi turns out that the roll-bars would come in handy when we reached the desert.
We were in a van with 4 other people and a driver and drove about 45 minutes away into the desert.
We pull off the side of the road and go through this hold in a fence and thats when the roll bars came in handy.
Im going to call it sanding but it is exactly like mudding just without the water.
The driver is going crazy going over all the sand dunes and spraying sand and getting sideways on these big hills of sand! Crazy ride for sure and it was amazing.
I took some video of it but I am not sure seby2 The thawb is commonly worn by men in the Arabian Peninsula Iraq and other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf.
It is normally made of cotton but heavier materials such as sheeps wool can also be used especially in colder climates in Iraq and Syria.
The style of the thawb varies slightly among the various regions within the Persian Gulf.
The sleeves and the collar can be stiffened to give a more formal appearance.
Other names may be used for this garment.
In Souraqia and Oman dishdasha is the most common word for the garment in the UAE the word kandura is used.
In Morocco the sleeves tend to be much shorter so that the thawb may seem more like a long T-shirt and is locally called gandora.
Also the neck tends to be more open than in its Saudi counterpart and is often embroidered as is the breast pocket.
Also it might lack buttons altogether.
The term thawb is also used to refer to similar womens garments.
The traditional Palestinian womans long tunic is called thawb.
Another example is a very long over-sized womans garment with a heavily embroidered front panel and billowing back also known as a Khaleeji dress which is most commonly seen in the West worn for performance of the Saudi womens social-style dances in which manipulation of the large thawb is a key component.
This garment is also known as Kanzu in Swahili and is commonly worn on the Swahili Coast by Swahili men.
how much you will be able to see because it is impossible to hold a camera still while you are flying down and around and over sand dunes while trying to hang on and stay in your seat.
The driver pulls up to what seems like empty desert area and about 100 or more cars pull in.
Here is where we meet Sebastian.
Sebastian is this beautiful falcon and he has my heart because the only time I have ever been able to lucid-dream I had a falcon named Sebastian.
I got to hold Sebastian and take photos and pet him.
You could extend your arm and he would fluff his wings out.
Definitely one of the coolest animals I have gotten to play with.
Where we were stopped you could see a bunch of camels in a fence.
The UAE keeps camels like we keep horses.
There are a lot of similarities I just dont understand how camels can carry as much as they do.
They have such tiny little legs.
Falcon Video   So after the falcon we get back into the jeep and take off down the sand dunes once more to My driver photobombing me drive to the highest dunes to watch the sunset.
It was very pretty but the sun did not set here like it does back home.
Back home the sun literally finds the horizon and starts to cut off.
First you have the full sun then slowly a straight line at the bottom the horizon works its way up to the top of the sun.
In the desert the sun just gets smaller and fades.
you can still see the entire circle- It is not disappearing it just ..
fades.
After the sunset we make our way back to where they had a camp for us.
We exit the sand dunes and approach a highway where we drive on the wrong side until there was a break in the barrier - then the driver cuts through the poles holding up the street lights on the highway and gets on the correct side of the road.
We go through a different gate and end up at the camels.
Camels are certainly a different ride than a ride on a horse.
I would have no clue how to steer these things.
Thank god for the guy on the ground leading us.
Jeep Sanding After the camel rides there was a camp that was just magical.
You walk in and there are from view left to right A tea and coffee area a sheesha/hooka area then a bar area then shops then the buffet tables then BBQ stalls then sand boarding out the back gate and up a huge sand dune then a henna lady then a place to dress in traditional garb restrooms then circling back to the entrance with a huge stage in the middle of the camp.
We walk in and grab some naan a type of bread and walk to the BBQ circle where I had the best Middle-eastern food ever.
I have no idea what I was eating but if I could only eat one thing for the rest of the trip it would be the BBQ sliced off the rotating fire pit with naan bread and some salad fixings with amazing sauce.
There was this amazing guy doing a dance with light up layers of clothing and when he would spin the entire suit would light up and he could manipulate the suit in crazy ways that any raver anywhere would be jealous.
Ill try to get Selfis in the dessert pictures of this Im pretty sure the camera died at that point.
There was also a belly dancer who had a sword on her head and did some crazy dancing.
We had dinner across from this family whos boys were 4 and 6 and she was from Singapore and he was from somewhere in the UK.
All four of them spoke English and the little 6 year old was fluent in Mandarin and English and would tell jokes.
Cute kid.
After dinner my mom and I snuck off to the little corner that had all the Hookas set up.
When the man came to give us coals he asked if we knew how to smoke.
Him Do you know how to smoke? Me Yes.
Him Are you sure? Me.
Yes.
I got this.
 I had previously worked at a hooka bar called Sultans in the US.
I can take those things apart like none other and I am perfectly capable of dealing with coals and whatnot And that is when my mom had her first hooka.
I have a feeling when I buy one she wont have to many issues with Desert sunset The city of Abu Dhabi is on the northeastern part of the Persian Gulf in the Arabian Peninsula.
It is on an island less than 250 metres 820 ft from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Mussafah Bridges.
A third Sheikh Zayed Bridge designed by Zaha Hadid opened in late 2010.
Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to Saadiyat Island by a five-lane motorway bridge.
Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to Reem Island and was completed in early 2011.
This is a multilayer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25000 automobiles to move per hour.
There are three major bridges of the project the largest has eight lanes four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.15 Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself but it has many suburbs on the mainland for example Khalifa City A B and C16 Al Raha Beach17 Al Bahia City A B and C Al Shahama Al Rahba Between Two Bridges Baniyas and Mussafah Residential.
The Emirate of Abu Dhabiâ€™s land surface measures 67340 square kilometres which is equivalent to about 87% of the UAEâ€™s total land area.18 Only 30% of the emirate is inhabited with the remaining vast expanses covered mainly by desert and arid land â€” constituting about 93% of the total land area.
Land cultivation and irrigation for agriculture and forestation over the past decade has increased the size of green areas in the emirate to about 5% of the total land area including parks and roadside plantations.
About 1.2% of the total land area is used for agriculture.
A small part of the land area is covered by mountains containing several caves.
The coastal area contains pockets of wetland and mangrove colonies.
Abu Dhabi also has dozens of islands mostly small and uninhabited some of which have been designated as sanctuaries for wildlife.19 Abu Dhabi has a hot desert climate KÃ¶ppen climate classification BWh.
Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year.
The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above 38 Â°C 100 Â°F.
During this time sandstorms occur intermittently in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.20 The cooler season is from November to March which ranges between moderately hot to warm.
This period also sees dense fog on some days.
On average January is the coolest month in the year while July and August are the hottest.
The oasis city of Al Ain about 150 km 93 mi away bordering Oman regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country however the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year-round humidity of the capital city it because she finally knows what it is.
Not to say I am going to buy one mom if you are reading this Im just saying youd be more open to it.
Exhaustion has set in and I do not know what we have planned today.
I know we are going to try to make it to the open markets or the souks but I am not entirely sure.
We have both started our Anti-Malaria pills but we have one more uninterrupted day here in Dubai! EDIT I forgot to tell you about day 2 in Dubai! We took the metro from Abu Dhabi to Dubai and went to the souks.
First we wandered around in the gold souk sadly there was nothing but this small camel that I fell in love with and then we went to the spice souks.
Im fairly sure there are some pictures on here of the souks but not of the metro.

The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary or one-humped camel C.
dromedarius which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa and the bactrian or two-humped camel C.
bactrianus which inhabits Central Asia.
Both species have been domesticated they provide milk meat hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.
The term camel is derived via Latin and Greek camelus and kamÄ“los respectively from Hebrew or Phoenician gÄ?mÄ?l which has later been transferred to a verb root meaning to bear or carry in Arabic jamala.45 The Hebrew meaning of the word gÄ?mÄ?l is derived from the verb root g.m.l meaning 1 stopping weaning going without or 2 repaying in kind.
This refers to its ability to go without food or water as well as the increased ability of service the animal provides when being properly cared for.
Camel is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae the two true camels the dromedary and bactrian and the four South American camelids the llama and alpaca are called New World camels while the guanaco and vicuÃ±a are called South American camels More camel rides Entrance to camp best food ever Sand Boarding Failed sand boarding Traditional wear I could pull off all black Mom traditional garb Henna Mom-henna Travel Blog Â» Middle East Â» United Arab Emirates Â» Abu Dhabi Â» Jebel Dhanna Â» Blogs Â» Dubai/Abu Dhabi UAE Tot 2.602s Tpl 0.029s cc 11 qc 47 dbt 0.0359s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.4mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.
