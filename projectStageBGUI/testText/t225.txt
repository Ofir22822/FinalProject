Going Alone to Mozambique 11/16/2015 by Kristin 27 Comments As this post goes live Iâ€™m sitting on a bus from Johannesburg bound for Maputo the capital of Mozambique.
If Iâ€™m honest Iâ€™m kind of terrified.
I keep telling myself it will be fine but honestly I have no idea what lies ahead of me.
I woke up to a strange message a week and a half ago I canâ€™t go with youâ€? it said A woman came floating outta nowhere and stole my heart.â€? It didnâ€™t come as a massive surprise.
J and I had always had one of those connections that you could just feel down to your very core.
He constantly referred to it as â€˜energyâ€™ and I couldnâ€™t argue â€“ thatâ€™s exactly what it felt like.
There was a magnetic pull that I resisted intently at first but eventually couldnâ€™t ignore.
I didnâ€™t want another impossible romance but thought maybe this time I can just enjoy the moment so thatâ€™s what I did.
I left swearing I would just let it be where it was beautiful and sweet but too short.
Except we were both very bad at leaving it where it was.
We kept in contact.
There were times I tried to pull away but he pulled me back in.
I told myself just to be casual about it.
To just see where it might lead whether that was somewhere or nowhere.
J always spoke of the amazingness of Mozambique â€“ the intensely blue water the gorgeous landscape and the laid back vibe.
Other South Africans I spoke with echoed his words.
They all took on the same tone of voice stars in their eyes and their words elongated when they spoke of its beauty.
Moooozambique!â€? They would say entranced.
After months of waffling back and forth I decided I owed it to myself to give it a try â€“ not J necessarily but the place and the adventure.
Whatever may or may not happen with us was just a bonus if not a big question mark.
He promised weâ€™d go together no-matter what.
It seemed perfect.
Except I started to feel a disconnect in the days before his message came through.
Itâ€™s like the wavelengths without any sign of weakening or gradually tapering off just stopped cold.
I was ready for the news to come I could feel it.
This is the story of my life after all.
How could I be mad at him? We hadnâ€™t seen each other in months and itâ€™s not like I loved the guy.
Between me and someone who is there standing in front of him itâ€™s no real contest.
I would have made the same choice.
He continued that heâ€™d wrestled with the guilt for the whole two weeks heâ€™d known her love? That soon? Hm OK and offered that the three of us could go together! Why not right? Three peas in a pod.
I didnâ€™t have to think about that one for too long.
I told him I wished him well but threeâ€™s a crowd and Iâ€™d be going this one alone.
Besides I wasnâ€™t going back to Africa for anyone but me.
After the disappointment subsided over the next ten hours surprised that was all it took an unwelcome feeling started to creep in and replace it dread.
J is a 6â€™4 South African guy who used to live in Mozambique.
I was happy to tag along.
I liked the idea of traveling with someone else for once especially someone with whom I got along so easily and who really knew the country well.
Weâ€™d had such awesome-sounding plans and I was pretty excited.
But those are gone with the wind now.
Now I have to start from square one.
This isnâ€™t a pity party.
There are worse things in life than having to travel somewhere beautiful alone I know.
Rather itâ€™s a confession I get nervous before I travel solo too.
In fact I get nervous almost every single time.
Southeast Asia wasnâ€™t uncharted territory and Europe is hardly intimidating.
I knew of plenty of women who had traveled to those places on their own.
I couldnâ€™t actually think of anywhere save for a couple of specific places Iâ€™d been to in the past that hadnâ€™t been traveled by someone I knew or at least knew of.
However Iâ€™m not going to shy away and cancel my plans.
Not because of some dude.
No way.
Iâ€™ve been saying lately in my newsletters that I havenâ€™t done anything that made me feel badass lately and maybe this is just what the doctor ordered.
Maybe itâ€™s exactly what I need to do to feel inspired and challenged again.
I havenâ€™t been able to find much of anything written by a solo female traveler who went to Mozambique.
So I guess itâ€™s time that someone went there and wrote something.
I guess that someone is me.
Wish me luck.

Comments Sarah says 11/16/2015 at 923 am Thank you for such an open and honest post.
I wish you all the luck in the world on your solo trip.
I can identify with the romance aspect you are sharing also alot of the time its just about the travel but love is something that is not easy when your dream is to travel.
Trust me I know.
Ive been a traveller and an expat for nearly 18 months now and it sure can be lonely you meet people that you feel a strong connection with and they touch your soul then leave.
Its hard.
But I would rather have that touch no matter how short because eventually that connection that touch will be so strong both parties will do what they have to do to make it work.
In the mean time I focus on my friends family and doing things I love â€“ especially travel xx Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1106 am True and thatâ€™s why I was so ready to just accept it for what it was then and there and just let it go when I got that message.
Itâ€™s the tough part that comes with this traveling lifestyle but you know itâ€™s still worth it.
I really agree.
Reply Nathan says 11/16/2015 at 108 pm Im sure youâ€™ll have just as brilliant a time on your own!

Reply Liz says 11/16/2015 at 629 pm Hey Kristen First I would just like to say thank you for being so open with your readers.
I can sort of relate to the feeling Iâ€™ve had something similar happen to me before.
But at the the same time there is huge excitement in knowing youâ€™re about to embark on a solo adventure and that when you finish you will have grown in ways you canâ€™t even predict.
I am sure you will have an amazing and unforgettable time in Mozambique canâ€™t wait to hear all about it.
Peace and love Liz ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1056 am Thanks for your kind comment! I definitely find being open makes me feel less alone and the support is always so encouraging so Iâ€™m glad that thereâ€™s still someone to share the journey with in a way ð?™‚ Reply shilpi says 11/16/2015 at 724 pm Best of Luck Kristinâ€¦.you are awesome.

Reply Nicole says 11/16/2015 at 1005 pm Iâ€™m sure you will have a brilliant time in Mozambique.
I was just there last month and had a great time.
Itâ€™s hard work getting around but Iâ€™m sure you will manage.
Visited Vilanculos Bazaruto Tofo and Maputo.
Early morning buses I have to say and didnâ€™t spend much time in Maputo.
Have fun! Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1053 am Thanks for the suggestions! Iâ€™m thinking I may hitchhike around rather than the busses.
Might be easiest.
Will see.

Youâ€™re right about the hospitality here and lovely people.
Iâ€™m enjoying it immensely so far.
Reply Preeti says 11/17/2015 at 1050 am Just read your post and by now you in Maputo or somewhere else enjoying the Mozambique culture and life.
I have travelled Maputo alone and I found ppl to be helpful and more and more mozambicians are learning English.
Just donâ€™t drive you bound to be pulled over for a bribe.
Have a wonderful journey.
Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1046 am Maputo was such a fun night for me and now Iâ€™m in Tofo and loving it.
Thanks for the advice! Itâ€™s similar to what Iâ€™ve heard.
Reply Helen says 11/17/2015 at 213 pm Youâ€™re gonna love it! ð?™‚ x Reply Marta says 11/17/2015 at 230 pm Ahhh that explains it! I just saw a photo on FB and was surprised that you did not mention Mozambique beforeâ€¦.
Anyways â€“ Kristin GOOD LUCk.
ALL WILL BE GOOD just keep your head on your shoulders as you always do.

Reply Anna says 11/18/2015 at 1246 am A beautifully honest post â€“ thereâ€™s something so freeing and inspiring for others about admitting that something scares you and doing it anyway.
Looking forward to reading more! Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1038 am Thank you.
I definitely still get nervous and now that Iâ€™m here I can see that itâ€™s not that hard and everything is going to be fine sometimes itâ€™s just a bit nerve-wracking because you donâ€™t know what you donâ€™t know.
Thatâ€™s why I had to go anyways! Reply Em says 11/21/2015 at 1144 am Hey we were staying in fatimas in Tofo Mozam but moved now to turtle cove in tofo.
We know J and the girl from coffee bay.
If you want to talk about it we can crack the code for you.
Emily and Emilie Reply Kristin says 11/27/2015 at 1152 pm The Emilys? Weâ€™ve met ð?˜‰ Also I donâ€™t really care what heâ€™s doing at this point.
Reply Saxon says 11/29/2015 at 242 pm Hi Kristin I am also a solo female traveller- been at it since 2013.
I just found your blog and Iâ€™m so glad I did.
Iâ€™m heading to South Africa in 5 days and Iâ€™m very excited.
I will be spending a couple of months up in Limpopo then visiting a friend in Zimbabwe after that exploring beautiful Mozambique in March.
I look forward to following you! Saxon Reply Kristin says 12/10/2015 at 632 am Youâ€™re going to have an amazing time! Just returned and have to say I love Africa more and more with every moment spent there.
Reply Kaleenas Kaleidoscope says 11/29/2015 at 433 pm Itâ€™s so awesome that you went anyway! I would have doneâ€“and feltâ€“the same thing.
Boyfriends on the road can be so tricky Iâ€™m learning the hard way with my travel relationship right now and it sucks when they donâ€™t work out and youâ€™re left up shit creek like that but something great is going to come of it thatâ€™s for sure.
Even if itâ€™s just getting your badassâ€? groove back.
ð?˜‰ Hope youâ€™re having the best time of it.
