Tower Bridge Bridging the gap between old and new majestic Tower Bridge offers some of the best views in London.

Spitalfields Located in bustling east London one of the cityâ€™s thriving arts and culture destinations Spitalfields is a hub of independent boutiques artisanal stores and pubs steeped in history.
The heart of the cityâ€™s silk-weaving industry in the 17th and 18th centuries a ride around the areaâ€™s hidden alleyways is like cycling back in time with cobbled delights such as Princelet Street revealing original townhouses dating back to Georgian times.
Nestled at the heart of this celebrated area lies Spitalfields Market.
Originally founded in 1638 and re-stablished by King Charles II in 1682 this former food market is now home to original fashion jewellery and arts and crafts and lined with delectable eateries fit for every taste and budget.

Rising from the ashes once again it was reborn as a covered market swiftly becoming one of the cityâ€™s best known.
