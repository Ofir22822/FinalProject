Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner When people think of Berlin the first thing that usually comes to mind is its most famous landmark â€“ the Brandenburg Gate.
For decades a symbol of division the monument has always been the beating heart of a major city bursting with ideas inspiration art culture and creativity.
Highlights in the western parts of Berlin include the KurfÃ¼rstendamm as elegant a shopping street as youll find anywhere the Kaufhaus des Westens department store better known as KaDeWe on-trend boutiques and exclusive galleries as well as beautiful residential streets and of course Berlins famous nightlife.
And speaking of nightlife no trip to Berlin would be complete without an evening at Friedrichstadt Palast Germanys leading variety theatre.
The cosmopolitan vibe also permeates the government district which spreads out to the east from Brandenburg Gate and from the neighbouring Reichstag.
Theres a sense of peace and freedom in the air here â€“ in stark contrast to the days when Berlin was responsible for unthinkable crimes.
The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe a work by New York architect Peter Eisenman located near the Brandenburg Gate serves as a reminder of those atrocities as does the Topography of Terror documentation centre at the former Gestapo headquarters.
Berlins prestigious Unter den Linden boulevard extends eastwards from Brandenburg Gate towards Alexanderplatz square passing the Museum Island World Heritage site as well as Berlin Cathedral the Neue Wache and the baroque Zeughaus armoury which today houses the German Historical Museum.

Nearby is Gendarmenmarkt widely lauded as Berlins most beautiful square.
The German Cathedral the French Cathedral and the Concert Hall form an ensemble of great majesty and grandeur here.

Berlin is the creative workshop of Germany a trendsetter and a capital of fashion design and music.
The progressive spirit of optimism that engulfed the reunified city was â€“ and still is â€“ astounding.
Hundreds of backyard art studios emerged from the shadows and art soon began to take over streets the walls of buildings and even entire districts.
Famously artists have also appropriated the remains of the Berlin Wall the section from Oberbaum bridge to Ostbahnhof station now going by the name of East Side Gallery has become an illustrated encyclopaedia of street art.
Today Kreuzberg Prenzlauer Berg NeukÃ¶lln and Wedding are the districts of choice for more than 20000 artists.
It is this creative force that lies behind the citys distinctive vibe â€“ a vibe that renders Berlin the capital for alternative and established art alike.
Immerse yourself in this creative cosmos.
Let yourself be inspired seduced and enchanted.
Get to know the people of Berlin.
Besides all the sightseeing the locals are arguably the best reason to discover this incredible city â€“ and the perfect excuse to come back and visit.
