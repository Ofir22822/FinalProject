DÃ¼sseldorf is after all the fashion capital of Germany.
More than 800 showrooms present the latest designer and couture creations and not just during trade show times.
KÃ¶nigsallee meanwhile is lined with exclusive boutiques where its all too easy to succumb to temptation in the name of fashion.
The enticing names of Marco Polo Hugo Boss Strellson and Calvin Klein are in good company alongside Armani Bulgari Gucci Jil Sander Prada Tiffany & Co.
and Versace forming a stronghold of refined taste.
KÃ¶nigsallee is one of only a handful of internationally regarded streets that can justifiably call themselves a boulevard.
Known affectionately as KÃ¶ this street is the beating heart of the fashion city a veritable catwalk lined by beautiful old chestnut trees.
Here its about seeing and being seen and putting your best foot forward.
But the KÃ¶ is not the only place to get your fill of fashion and shopping if you have a taste for the finer things in life youll love every bit of DÃ¼sseldorf.
Theres Schadowstrasse for example or Carlstadt an idyllic quarter of antique shops galleries and art dealers.
And of course the old town whose laid-back vibe has attracted unconventional fashion boutiques and numerous alternative stores.
The old town also has an abundance of pubs bars and clubs that gives it the nickname of the longest bar in the world and offers ample opportunity to relax and unwind after hitting the shops.
Or simply to model your latest purchases.
The city centres many shopping arcades mean that wet weather neednt stand in the way of a shopping spree.
Schadow Arkaden Sevens KÃ¶ Galerie and stilwerk offer a winning combination of quality and variety as well as plenty of space.

Even if youre looking for something with a smaller price tag youll still be spoilt for choice in DÃ¼sseldorf.
For example there are the DÃ¼sseldorf arcades around Lorettostrasse or the hip Flingern quarter with its trendy offbeat offerings.
But it would be doing a disservice to DÃ¼sseldorf to describe it only as a fashion and shopping mecca.
The city has so much more to offer.
Culturally minded travellers are particularly well catered for with events such as the Old Town Autumn attracting tens of thousands of visitors.
DÃ¼sseldorf also prides itself on its theatres concert halls art galleries and places of historical interest as well as its magnificent parks and gardens.

DÃ¼sseldorf is home to Europes third-largest Japanese community after London and Paris.
The vibrant Japanese quarter is centred around Hotel Nikko on Immermannstrasse where you can find Japanese supermarkets bookshops restaurants and much more besides.
And if all that fashion shopping and culture leaves you feeling worn out you can head to Burgplatz to unwind in style.
One of Germanys most beautiful squares this is the ultimate weekend and evening hangout for the people of DÃ¼sseldorf.
So sit back with a glass of altbier look out to the Rhine and just enjoy the moment.
And if you happen to notice that the passers-by are exceptionally well dressed then you can probably guess where theyve done their shopping.
