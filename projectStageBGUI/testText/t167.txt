Reaching seemingly endlessly up into the sky Ulm Minsters tower has watched over the city for centuries.
After the Second World War during which much of the city was destroyed Ulm took the right approach to reconstruction.
The city planners achieved a successful compromise that resulted in a unique cityscape of lovingly restored buildings on the one hand and breathtaking modernity on the other.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Ulm Minster the finger of God with the highest church tower in the world is the citys predominant building.
And the square on which it stands is an endlessly fascinating place that offers a great mix of historical and modern architecture.
But there is definitely more to Ulm than the Minster and MÃ¼nsterplatz square and at a stones throw away the beautiful town hall is one of the reasons why.
The oldest part of the present building was erected in 1370 and served as a trading house.
It was first mentioned as a town hall in 1419 and the ornate astronomical clock was added in around 1520.
In the buildings stairwell you can look up and see a replica of the flying machine built by Albrecht Ludwig Berblinger the legendary tailor of Ulm.
Unfortunately his attempts at flying more than 200 years ago were not crowned with success.
On the crucial day there was no favourable wind and his flight ended in the gushing Danube.
Nevertheless he is still esteemed today as an able man and the locals penchant for striking out in new directions â€“ at least in spirit â€“ is a reminder of another famous son of Ulm Albert Einstein.
A new direction at least in terms of urban development was taken with the design of Ulms Neue Mitte new centre between MÃ¼nsterplatz and the town hall.
Here old and new buildings form an ensemble of striking contrasts.
The first of these is the Stadthaus by New York architect Richard Meier.
This internationally acclaimed milestone in modern architecture is an open house for encounters with art culture and people â€“ and with a remarkable city.
Its basement contains a fascinating permanent exhibition on the archaeology and history of MÃ¼nsterplatz square providing a clear contrast to the architecture of the building itself.
The House of Senses which features an opticians with a cafÃ© on the third floor and affords fantastic views of the minster the Sparkasse building Wolfram WÃ¶hrs Weishaupt art gallery the glass pyramid municipal library by Gottfried BÃ¶hm and the Obere Stube with its moving facade stand out against the nearby historical minster and town hall with their modern mode of expression â€“ which was welcomed wholeheartedly by experts but divided opinion among Ulm residents.
Further ahead via the Weinhof â€“ an important trading house for almost 500 years â€“ are the ancient Steinhaus stone house the Romanesque Chapel of St.
Nicholas dating from around 1220 and the 17th-century SchwÃ¶rhaus oath house.
Every year on SchwÃ¶rmontag a public holiday in Ulm the towns mayor stands on the SchwÃ¶rhaus balcony and repeats the historic oath of 1397 to uphold the constitution.
A walk through Ulm Museum is also fascinating.
The archaeological collection boasts the LÃ¶wenmensch lion man the oldest animal/human sculpture in the world dating back approximately 30000 years and features alongside a collection of major European and American artworks from 1945 onwards.
A distinctive feature of Ulms townscape are two towers that form part of the old town fortifications the GÃ¤nseturm goose tower and the Metzgerturm butchers tower built in 1345 and better known as the Leaning Tower of Ulm.
The story behind the tower is typical of Ulm.
Legend has it the tower got its name from the butchers who added sawdust to their sausage mix.
When the townspeople realised this they locked the culprits in the tower.
And as the corpulent butchers huddled together in fear in a corner upon the angry mayors entrance the tower is supposed to have tilted.
In actual fact the tower is leaning because it stands on a former swamp.
However you should try to stay upright when you visit the quaint fishermens quarter which dates from the Middle Ages or one of the many beer gardens in Ulm and Neu-Ulm â€“ Ulms sister town in Bavaria on the other side of the Danube.
But that is of course up to you.
The main thing is that you visit Ulm.

Â» Highlights close Reaching for the skies Ulm Minster The Gothic Minster has been a dominant feature in the centre of Ulm for centuries and is the towns most famous landmark.
It is also known far and wide for having the tallest church tower in the world the Finger of God stretches up to the skies reaching a height of almost 162 metres.
This stunning piece of architecture is complemented by a number of exquisite art treasures inside the church.
The minster is also famous for its 15th century choir stalls by JÃ¶rg Syrlin.
The carved busts in particular are considered masterpieces of art history.
Where Ulm has its roots the fishermens and tanners quarter Set in an idyllic location at the confluence of the Blau and Danube rivers is the fishermens quarter.
Resided in predominantly by craftsmen in the Middle Ages it is the main historical ensemble in the heart of Ulms old quarter.
This is the site of the Franconian royal court established in around 800 and of Ulms royal palace which was first documented in 854.
Its ancient lanes winding passageways half-timbered houses bridges and jetties give a real impression of what medieval life must have been like.
The tributary of the river Blau is lined with an array of historical buildings from the towns past.
