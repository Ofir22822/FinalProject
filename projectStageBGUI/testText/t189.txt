The Kladruby Stud Farm is also one of the oldest stud farms in the world.
In 1579 Emperor Rudolf II promoted the farm to an stud farm for the imperial court and it has been the home of the Kladruber horses ever since.
Kladruber horses are currently bred both in Kladruby which is particularly well known for its white variety and in SlatiÅˆany known for its black variety.
The main horse herd is housed in Kladruby nad Labem â€“ there are about 500 pedigree studs mares and foals.
What Is the Kladruber Like? The white Kladruber was originally used for ceremonial purposes in royal and imperial courts around Europe and the black Kladruber for the coaches of church dignitaries.
Today the white Kladruber is still used for its original purpose by the Swedish and Danish royal courts.
At present the Kladrubers represent the farm in draft horse show competitions but you can also see them in standard dressage demonstrations by the High School of Spanish Riding and as part of mounted police forces.
Kladrubers are also used in hippotherapy and leisure riding thanks to their calm nature.
