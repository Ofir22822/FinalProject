Forgotten password? Everything about travel Travelogues Austria A town in midst of Alps A town in midst of Alps A visit to Tyrol Iâ€™ve visited Innsbruck several times but since I liked it so much Iâ€™ve decided to return there once more and present it to you.
Well I did have other reasons too.
I love cycling but cycling really really fast and the air of Ljubljana started bothering my lungs so I wanted to go to the other side of the Alps to where the air is clean! After some 500 kilometers and seven hours of train rides Iâ€™ve arrived at Telf just a stoneâ€™s throw away from Innsbruck the regional economic administrative and cultural center of Tyrol.
If youâ€™ll drive through the region on Austrian highways youâ€™ll see a flashing sign for 100km/h warning you to slow down â€“ but not because the road would get dangerous but to reduce pollution.
Itâ€™s a preventive action to preserve the environment â€“ but the fines for speeding are no lower as they shouldnâ€™t be.
Innsbruck is the biggest city in Tyrol and fifth biggest in Austria after Vienna Graz Linz and Salzburg with its 120.000 people.
Itâ€™s in the middle of a long but narrow valley with tall mountains on the sides even higher than 2500m.
A place to feel good...
Unlike the air in my native Ljubljana this air is cleaner and lung friendlier for thereâ€™s basically no smog here maybe only for a few days in a year.
Hopefully it will stay that way for the number of population keeps growing mostly due to Turkish and Chinese immigration in search for a better future.
Traditionally theyâ€™re preserving the environment separating waste to the most detailed subgroups.
And not only thatâ€™s itâ€™s beautiful almost everybody speaks English â€“ for tourism plays a vital role in the economy.
If you wish to stay active thereâ€™s even a 24 hour fitness studio so if you canâ€™t sleepâ€¦ But if youâ€™re a martial arts buff better go across the border to Germany.
But if you simply enjoy contact sports you might try boxing in Innsbruck â€“ as a sport in the ring naturally.
A University city Innsbruck is an ideal place for somebody who wants to get a university degree in many a branch.
You pay for tuition but the studies are for free.
Illogical? Well every student getâ€™s a scholarship but sets aside a part of it to pay for tuition so thereâ€™s enough left to live.
Yes itâ€™s true.
Itâ€™s not all as it seems at the first glance.
Youâ€™ll not be missing a classical burek if you study here for theyâ€™ve spread across Europe just like Balcan beats which play in Innsbruck discos at night.
Unfortunately not every study is available so for machine engineers you have to go to Graz or Vienna.
There is a manager school here though like it was in Kumrovec in our Yugoslavian days where you gain political skills.
An Olympic city The city hosted winter Olympics twice in 1964 and 1976 making it the only city to host the game twice within a dozen years apart the ancient Greek games at mount Olympus.
In 1999 they hosted the biggest snow boarding spectacle of the world Â»Air & Style ContestÂ« and were one of the places for the 2008 UEFA European championship in football.
Thereâ€™s a whole lot of goings-on in the fields of sports and culture either high ranking events or simply just a lively local scene at the stations or squares.
Austrians spend a lot of money on culture which is obvious from the numerous theatres in the city.
Thereâ€™s the State theatre the City theatre the Kellertheater Knight games the Western-Rail theatre the Melon...
And there are also many museums the castle Ambras State museum of Tyrol National arts museum City museum the Royal hunting museum the museum of anatomyâ€¦ and many parks like Alpenzoo Hofgarten Rapoldi Schlosspark Abras Pechegarten Wilten and Beselepark.
Â»Hallo GrÃ¼Ã? Gott â€¦Â« The local transport runs like clockwork.
Apart from the bus they also have the tram system all also well connected to the main railroad station and the airport.
So walking or cycling around town there might be airplanes just a few feet above your head.
Itâ€™s a very friendly environment for tourists both biologically as socially.
The nature is beautiful the air is clean â€“ especially in neighboring mountains.
Thereâ€™s a lot of sunshine and if not itâ€™s only rainclouds above.
The people are open and welcoming even the girls greet back on the street although they donâ€™t know you.
Itâ€™s even more obvious in smaller places where everybody greets everybody else.
The city center is beautiful with many pedestrian zones many fountains and benches to relax and enjoy the view.
Itâ€™s a beautiful city with a big center.
So if you want a healthy place with Alps around with no traffic jams and friendly peopleâ€¦ then Tyrol is the choice you should consider as a holiday destination or maybe even permanent settlement in either Innsbruck or one of the small neighboring places.
But if not in the city you might have to take the bus train or even a bike to the center.
Oh and btw who makes the best mountain bikes in the world? KTM Austria.
