We came with a open mind as the island didnt seem to get glowing reports from a few people we spoke to but we needed to be fairly near to bangkok to keep travelling time down? Very very pleasantly surprised its lovely! Either the people we spoke to are picky or we have very low standards?.......whichever its all gravy........
After a few weeks of moving on every 2 to 3 ish days we have settled here to stop and smell the flowers.
Got ourselves another moped and loving scooting around the island.
In a beautiful bungalow on a resort which quite honestly is way too posh for us but hey it was cheap as its low season and what the heck weve bloody earnt it! We arrived full on clampet style all dishevelled creased and stinky! ATTRACTIVE..........
Spent the last couple of days either in the pool or scooting around the island looking for adventure......and adventure we did find! Spent a lovely morning at the most amazing elephant sanctuary DSCN2448 in the heart of the jungle here.
This place had excellent morals and ethics on how their elephants live their lives.
Yes they are ridden but they need that to keep a balanced mind a bored elephant is a naughty one...the ride is through the jungle in its most natural habitat.
After the ride we swam and bathed a couple of them which they LOVED! All that fuss and playtime in the water helps maintain their happiness then its feedtime.
The elephants did not live in a confined place instead the lived in the jungle with their mahouts which is how they have lived for centuries! Such a great place and each elephant was very happy.
Sat out on the porch of our bungalow with yet another leo beer......hic!.....and a stray dog sat at my feet.
She is a little love and made herself very at home with us.
That is one thing i was dreading about this trip seeing dogs/cats in sorry ole states.
Throughout thailand laos and cambodia we have seen very little animal sadness and no sign of rabies.
Think its fair to say the majority of south east asians genuinely care for their animals DSCN2449 even the street dogs seem to be a healthy weight.
The monks do an awful lot for the animals too which goes a long way.
We have seen far worse in europe! Peace and love xx « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 21 Displayed 21 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Mel Godwin melly and adam Travel really is the best education....
