Along with the Roland statue the citys very own statue of liberty it still stands as a reminder of the pride that the locals have for their city their freedom and their sovereignty.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Once inside the town hall you simply must take a look in the Upper Hall.
In this exquisite room the lovingly crafted model ships dating from the 16th to the 18th century reflect the importance of shipping for the city.
Other special attractions include the adjoining Golden Chamber with its art nouveau features.
A gem of a different kind can be found below ground the historical Ratskeller â€“ Germanys oldest wine cellar.
Writers such as Wilhelm Hauff and Heinrich Heine used to come here for inspiration and todays visitors can still sample from the largest collection of German wines in the country.
Back on the market square you can stand eye to eye with Sir Roland â€“ or rather eye to knee.
Because at five and a half metres in height 10.21 metres including the base and baldachin this is the tallest free-standing sculpture of the German Middle Ages.
It represents Hanseatic freedom and also served a much more practical purpose as the distance between the knees is exactly one Bremen elle a historical unit of measurement it is thought that the pragmatic Bremen merchants used it to measure out their material.
Today it is customary to touch Rolands pointed knees before setting off on a stroll through the lanes of Bremen old town.
