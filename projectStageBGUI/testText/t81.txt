Amsterdamâ€™s beer culture It is no exaggeration to say that Holland is a nation of beer drinkers.
Walk along an Amsterdam canal on a summerâ€™s evening and youâ€™ll pass countless little cafÃ©s and bars where people are thoroughly enjoying their vaasje â€“ a quarter-liter or roughly half-pint glass of lager.
Brewing beer has a very long tradition in Holland beginning with monks in the middle ages and leading to famous brands such as Heineken Amstel and Grolsch.
The Dutch even have their own version of craft beer.
Speciaalbier or simply â€˜special beerâ€™ is often served from bottles and is usually much stronger â€“ both in flavor and in alcohol content â€“ than the standard lager.
More Anglo-American styles of craft beer such as American Pale Ale are also widely available.
Visit famous breweries in Amsterdam The most famous beer from Holland is undoubtedly Heineken and the Heineken Experience pulls out all the stops to cater to international visitors.
Located in the first Heineken brewery to be built in Amsterdamâ€™s De Pijp neighborhood this museum experience offers a self-guided interactive tour where visitors can learn about the history of the brand and the brewing process and of course enjoy a taster.
Those who prefer their experience a bit smaller scale should opt for a visit to Brouwerij â€™t IJ just east of the city center.
The brewery produces various beers that are much revered throughout Holland and best of all itâ€™s located in a towering windmill.
Brouwerij â€™t IJ offers tours but you can also just go and sample their wares in the cozy bar or on the spacious terrace.
Independent craft breweries The global craft beer revolution hasnâ€™t bypassed Amsterdam and noteworthy proponents that can be visited include Oedipus Brewing an arty industrial space north of the River IJ that offers live music to go alongside your beer sampling while Butcherâ€™s Tears is a hip but dedicated craft beer brewery in the south of the city.
Another great brewery to visit is De Prael an inclusive social enterprise serving delicious organic craft beer in laid-back cozy surroundings â€“ plus they also host tours and tastings.
And at the two locations of the popular Brouwerij Troost you can also indulge in some hearty food such as burgers.
Please note that brewery tours typically only admit over-18s.
Amsterdam boasts countless small breweries that produce specialty beers with dedication and expert craftsmanship.
For an overview please go to the I Amsterdam breweries blog.

Dutch bar snacks are often deep-fried and always delicious.
And later you could do worse than trying some traditional Dutch food for dinner.
