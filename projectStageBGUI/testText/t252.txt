Tomorrow we board the cruise on Spectrum of the Seas.
Theresa has been affected the last couple of days by the amount of sand in the air.
To try to stop this progressing into something worse she went looking for something to help it this morning.
She could not locate a chemist but found the supermarket and got some throat lozenges.
That should help.
Whilst she was there she also stocked up on some extra supplies that we shall need whilst we are on the cruise.
We have a booking at the Salt and Pepper restaurant in the local Al Bandar Rotana & Arjaan by Rotana Hotel for Friday brunch.
Not been here before so have no idea what to expect.
This is another buy one get one free from The Entertainer.
We had a lazy morning in the hotel then walked about a mile to the hotel.
We had left plenty of time as we were not 100% sure where it was but found it really easily.
We like to get into these brunches early to get pictures before the food is touched but we were 20190503_115012 an hour early so had a coffee in their coffee shop to occupy ourselves.
The food on offer at this brunch was split down by countries.
So you had sweet and savouries from each countries all grouped together.
A very unique way of displaying the food as normally all sweet items are together.
We tried to sample from many different areas and all food we had was really excellent.
We do not normally take a lot of notice of the food left at these brunches but the couple at the table next to us caught our attention.
They were constantly bringing back plates heaped with different foods and most of it was being taken away uneaten by the servers.
The amount of food that they wasted was more than the two of us actually ate.
This disgusts us.
The walk back to our hotel was nice as it gave us a chance to walk off some of the food.
We shall be leaving the hotel and joining the Spectrum of the Seas for it´s voyage to Singapore tomorrow so this afternoon we had to pack up all our belongings.
We had one entertainer voucher 20190503_143437 left for an ice cream at Baskin Robbins so had a wander over to the mall for one last visit.
A great way to finish a great day and a great visit to Dubai.
Thanks Dubai.
Our third visit.
It has been a blast again.

We took early retirement at the end of 2010 and intended to spend an extended time travelling.
First we visited our favourite location of Tenerife where we intended on staying for three or four months and possibly buying a property ready for our finally settling down.
We have enjoyed our time here in Tenerife so much we have bought a property and have decided to change our travelling plans.
We still plan to travel the world but will now be doing so over a longer period of time with regular stays in Tenerife in between.
We are keeping this blog as simpl...
