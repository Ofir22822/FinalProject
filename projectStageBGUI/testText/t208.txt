Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 234shares Sustainable travel is a lot easier with a little help from eco friendly travel products! Here are our tried and tested favourite eco friendly travel products and ultimate packing list for eco friendly travel â€“ Staying sustainable on the road has never been easier!

Please find our disclosure at the end of this post or read our policy here.
Our Packing Guide + Favourite Eco Friendly Travel Products This packing list is full of the best eco friendly travel products to help minimise the impact of your trip as much as possible.
Weâ€™ve put in all of the products we use love and recommend from our trips as well as new ideas weâ€™ve received from friends and fellow conscious travellers along the way.
When it comes to travelling with minimal impact we know that travel can never be 100% sustainable we find that fore-warned is fore-armed.
Many of our go to places on our travels street food public transport anyone are ironically the situations where you might get most stuck.
Longing for some fresh coconut water but the vendor only has plastic straws? On a long train journey and running out of water? We know from personal experience the plastic water bottles for sale start to look tempting.
A few simple accessoriesâ€? can go a long way to avoid the need of ever having to buy single-use plastic products.
If it seems like an investment to buy so many products ahead of travel itâ€™s worth remembering how much many of these products save in the long run â€“ both environmentally and economically.
An investment into a water filter bottle will quickly pay itself back with money saved on buying bottled water.
Last but not least we want to spell out that itâ€™s not about being perfectâ€?.
We know weâ€™ve certainly had moments where weâ€™ve had to resort to buying something in plastic because we were really hungry forgot our metal straws etc.
Those moments are bound to happen.
The point is that with a little preparation we will be able to avoid 90%+ waste that can often be incurred with travel â€“ which is a huge! ð?™‚ The Best Eco Friendly Travel Products To help make this packing list as easy to use as possible weâ€™ve divided it into several categories.
Happy packing! The Essentials Eating and Drinking Toiletries Travel Accessories Luggage & Travel Bags Clothing Should you offset your carbon? Sustainable Travel Essentials In a hurry or only want to take a few things with you? In our humble opinions the following sustainable travel products are game changers and should be part of anyoneâ€™s sustainable travel kit! Water to Go water filter bottle if travelling to a country where tap water is not safe to drink plus extra filters Refillable Klean Kanteen bottle if travelling to a country where tap water is safe to drink Bamboo or Stainless Steel drinking straws Bamboo cutlery Your pick from our toiletries recommendations below Reef-safe and natural Sunscreen Eco Friendly Travel Products for Eating & Drinking Much of the single use plastic we use on our travels comes in the form of plastic straws shopping bags and take-out drinks containers / plastic cutlery.
By taking re-usable products with us and keeping them in our day bag we cut out the need to consume these completely! Refillable Water Bottles Water purification bottle such as a Water to Go or Grayl if youâ€™re likely to travel to places where tap water is unsafe.
Read our full guide to water filter bottles here.
A Stojo or thermos mug for hot drinks Compact tiffinâ€? lunchbox set for food on the go Re-usable Cutlery Produce bags for grocery shopping Bamboo straws or Stainless Steel Straws Skip the plastic packaging with bars vs bottles of soap Eco Friendly Toiletries There are so many wonderful eco-friendly cosmetic and toiletry brands to choose from these days it can be a little overwhelming! Our suggestion for travel in general is to opt for solid products vs liquid ones where possible e.g.
shampoo bars soaps instead of body wash stick deodorant etc.
Choosing these means a lighter load you wonâ€™t be carrying around 90% water and you can take more with you â€“ great if youâ€™re going on a longer trip! We suggest sharing products between couples / family members if you can! We specifically donâ€™t recommend LUSH products here.
Weâ€™ve seen them recommended on many an eco-friendly travel blog and weâ€™ve even used them ourselves too but we have found that far from being eco-friendly they are actually full of harsh chemicals.
The shampoo bar made our scalps dry and itchy and LUSH has recently got into a lot of hot water with advertising standards for their products not being as natural as they may seemâ€¦ An eco friendly toiletry bag â€“ like this one! Organic Shampoo bar like this one Body soap bar like this one + this soap case to keep it nice.
If youâ€™re travelling longer term and prefer liquid soap we recommend Dr Bronners which comes in concentrated form and can be used for hair body and even clothes washing! Bamboo Toothbrushes Reef-safe and Natural Sun Screen/Block Natural Insect Repellant Plastic-free cotton buds Feminine Products I recommend either the Organicup menstrual cup or organic cotton period underwear like this set.
Non-Toxic Stick Deodorant Raw Coconut Oil we use this instead of taking after-sun and different moisturisers as Coconut Oil does the job perfectly!.
Make sure to buy raw rather than the processed stuff! Essential Oils â€“ if youâ€™re prone to dry skin mould in humid climates or other skin conditions find the best essential oil for you and take with you.
Tea Tree & Lavender are both great for skin irritation and fungal skin infections while peppermint is one of the best natural air fresheners around! Make sure to buy organic ones! Linen turkish towels / facecloths.
Lightweight absorbent natural and easily washable â€“ we like this one or check out House of Jude if youâ€™re in Canada.
Depending on where you live we have a few different favourite eco-friendly brands for toiletries.
If you live in the UK we love Guiltless Skin for their face oils and serums which have kept our skin hydrated on the road.
In Canada we love the Great Canadian Hemp Company.
Eco Friendly Travel Accessories Here are some of our favourite sustainable travel accessories from our trips We love Pala Eyewearâ€™s latest range of Bio and Recycled Acetate Sunglasses Ladiesâ€™ scarves â€“ always useful for travel! We love these ones made from Hemp.
Cotton tote bags useful for separating laundry shopping as a beach bag etc etc! Solar power bank / charger â€“ this one has two USB ports and lasts for 4 phone charges.
Compostable PELA Phone Case Solar Powered Lamp Eco Yoga mat made from natural jute Eco Friendly Luggage & Travel Bags Perhaps the most important part â€“ what we put all of our favourite eco travel products in! Luckily there are some great eco friendly bags on the market.
We love our Osprey backpacks â€“ weâ€™ve been using our Osprey Farpoint 40 for many a trip and itâ€™s still going strong.
For those who prefer their luggage with wheels we are fans of Samsoniteâ€™s new Eco Nu range â€“ an entire range of suitcases that are made out of recycled plastic bottles! Eco-Friendly Clothing for Travel Sustainable fashion is a topic in its own right but here are a few of our favourite ethical / sustainable accessories we like to take with us Basic bamboo vests & organic cotton t-shirts great for keeping cool! Leggings & Yoga wear made from recycled plastic by Teeki Sustainable Swimwear â€“ some of our favourite companies are Vitamin A Swim Londre and Summersalt Should you Offset your Carbon? We donâ€™t believe that carbon offsetting is a solution to making travel more sustainable â€“ rather the change in behaviour and creating less impact when we travel has to come from the tourism industry travel providers and us as travellers.
Paying someone else to offset our carbon is not enough.
That said we do encourage people to look into the option of offsetting in addition to travelling more consciously.

My main travel essential â€“ a water bottle with a built-in filter! I travel mainly around Asia and itâ€™s a lifesaver here since the tap water is not safe for drinking.
Though in many places now they have water coolers where you can refill your bottle.
Absolutely love this! But then my filter-bottle is perfect for travelling to rural areas.
I use the LifeStraw bottle when I go trekking and hikes or hiking.
I can easily take water from the river and drink it right away.
While others have to wait until we reach a guesthouse to buy water or they have to use purification tablets which make the water smell and taste like swimming pool.
