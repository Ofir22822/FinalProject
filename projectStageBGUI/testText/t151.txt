Forgotten password? Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Me alter-ego Vienna and Sex in the city Me alter-ego Vienna and Sex in the city My soul led me down the trail of music and songs.
I went to listen I went to watchâ€¦ I went and my other me wentâ€¦ I wanted to taste the tune of rockâ€™nâ€™roll.
I received much more.
Experiencing Vienna in my very own way You melt into the fabric of the magical city as soon as you align yourself to the flow of the subway train.
Smell of tracks smell of peopleâ€¦ everybody speaking their own language and with some imagination you see what they say what they think and what they feel.
You take on the form of their essence for now you heart beats with this city.
Suitcase small but comfortable Jeans black nail polish some jewellery and a lot of enthusiasm.
You make a fist raise it high and enjoy the sounds of string.
I know today to be my day! The scent of a guitar carries me into a hall full of people.
We all wait for one - Alter Bridge! No disappointment.
City laughs.
We all laugh.
I think we all blushed a little.
The stringâ€™s a lifeline connected directly to our hearts.
Full of adrenalin I return to the hostel.
Tired from the travel from tension from the concertâ€¦ but me and my alter-ego are too full of adrenalin! No bedtime yet! I flew on the wings arriving to the room.
I canâ€™t believe the body to be so tired when the soul is so awake.
Letâ€™s hit the hay.
Tomorrow is another day.
The roomie is not happy about my night wondering through the room.
Angry looks and a comment of utter dissatisfaction with my behaviour just bounced off this happy face of mine above any negativity.
Today Iâ€™m happy.
I thought how silly of a person to take a dormitory room without expecting a happy-go-lucky person like me prancing into the room at night lighting a light and letting out a sound.
Majestic Vienna in the morning Everybody is rushing to work.
The city is overcrowded with people.
I missed a heartbeat of connection with the city but got in synch with when I saw the first cafÃ© with a couple holding hands glazing at each other full of love.
A punker with red hair slowly approaches with his face full of piercings and an elegant lady with a fancy handbag and a strong perfume rushes by me on a micro scooter.
A micro scooter! People here love micro scooters and MP3 players.
Vienna charmed me anew Itâ€™s not my first time in Vienna.
Hence no interest in the buildings no interest in sights.
Iâ€™m interested in people.
I watch sip and learn.
I fill my soul with a few hour long walk through the art gallery where I realize how thin a line between being humane and being human is.
Everyone who sees the Egon Schiele exhibition and the other I might say of same conviction will reflect on themselves at least a bit for walking among these works of art you see how little it takes to fully reveal oneâ€™s self â€“ and how much talent egoism and difference it takes to show this to the world.
Recommended.
Night life â€“ yes or no? Yes.
Following the advice of the teens from the subway club Chelsea is the place to go.
Nothing special Iâ€™d say.
Maybe.
But its modesty and good music convinced me.
Itâ€™s clear this club had been through many a thing.
Cracks carry a burden on their shoulders.
Not just the fact itâ€™s under the railroadâ€¦ we canâ€™t imagine how many stories unfolded here.
Stories are written here with words that need to remain hidden and untouched.
Austrians are shy people.
Itâ€™s clear as soon as I show Iâ€™m different.
Iâ€™m foreign.
They eat me with their eyes and I feel they desire a pinch of my devilishness my spontaneity.
Dorm room shines in its true colours First the angry roomieâ€? takes my shower gel privileges away come on itâ€™s like taking somebodyâ€™s used socks then during the night I see something that surprises even an open minded person.
A girl from the dorm decided to bring her nightly treat into the room to give us a glimpse of Sex in the city â€“ or a little nightly digital TV programme â€“ free of charge.
And by a treat Iâ€™m not talking about a dildo but a piece of flesh.
Drunk to oblivion they were unable to reach a climax in 2-4 hours time is a very relative and touchy thing in the still of the night but they have tried really hard.
Moaning his nor hers didnâ€™t help.
I awake to the sounds of ecstasy.
It doesnâ€™t end.
We go for the toilet if thereâ€™s nothing to do at night you need to go pee toss and turn in beds and donâ€™t know what to do â€“ but they donâ€™t seem to notice.
Drunk as a skunk When they during a pause relieve themselves of a pint or two of consumed alcohol I realize how drunk the girl really is.
Leaving the toilet she found herself in front of the wardrobe closet and due to her dumbed down reflexes she could not avoid them.
The wardrobe hit her so hard he woke up the people in the other room too.
Oh yeah when thereâ€™s war itâ€™s war for everybody no sleeping tonight! Open invitation Next morning a Spaniard a really cool roommate told me I had a feeling it was an open invitation to join in!â€? I only laughed when he crossed himself in the which made me sure I was not the only one who thought how tasteless and idiotic this behaviour was.
Not understanding the angry and convicting looks from tired faces a friend of hers told the girl she was a bit too loud â€“ but she remembered nothing.
Sad isnâ€™t it? Alter ego Itâ€™s ok for people to escape from their daily routine and let go forget and enjoy the ride where it takes us.
Each in their own way.
Through smells sights sounds or sexâ€¦ itâ€™s just important not to forget our soul for regardless of the city Vienna or any else the adventures stories or experiences we get â€“ tomorrow is a new day when weâ€™ll have to live with today.
Travel meet live! Your alter ego should just be the last resort to open your eyes and give you courage to do one or two things more which you might not do otherwise â€¦ Good night Vienna!
