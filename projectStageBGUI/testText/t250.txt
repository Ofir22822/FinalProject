10 Ways Traveling Will Change You 10/20/2014 by Kristin 38 Comments I recently wrote a post about the 10 questions I had after two years of consecutive solo world traveling.
During this period of time I have rarely spent more than a few days in each place and never stayed anywhere for more than two months the longest was my most recent summer in Berlin.
I also rarely spent longer than a few days in any one individualâ€™s company with a few exceptions.
Pin me! Solo traveling is something Iâ€™ve advocated ever since I began traveling and while I still believe it has all kinds of positive benefits I acknowledge that any kind of radical life shift especially one maintained over a long period of time will also come with drawbacks.
While traveling has taught me more over the past two years about the world than I could ever have hoped to learn without that kind of exposure to other cultures and belief systems it has also taught me a lot about the world within.
Here are 10 ways that traveling has changed me and inevitably tends to change everyone in a similar situation 1 It breeds selfishness Solo traveling narrows down the direct impact of nearly every choice to one person â€“ you.
Decisions answering the smaller questions like what should I eat today?â€? to the larger ones like which country would I like to visit next?â€? all fall to you..
Unless youâ€™ve met a persons you want to remain with longer or are making a more major decision like whether or not to go home for an important holiday or life event the vast majority of what you do is governed and experienced by you and you alone.
This can make it pretty hard to commit to any kind of relationship because suddenly you have to start considering the desires of others and canâ€™t be as selfish anymore.
2 It removes filters and exposes you to your real self Traveling solo particularly in developing countries removes most external influences that caused us to make decisions in our lives back home jobs relationships rent costs image ads television etc.
When youâ€™re in places where nobody wears designer anything a $3 dorm room is perfectly normal and street food is a favorite staple even for those who also come from a corporate background the B.S.
is removed and people can be who they want to be.
People say that traveling makes them into a new person but I believe it just allows them to be who theyâ€™ve always been.
Maybe thatâ€™s someone who freely enjoys excess turns into a Buddhist devotes his/her life to helping others or a whole host of other lifestyles.
3 You realize you can actually do whatever you want All it takes sometimes! So many people say to me I wish I could do what you doâ€? or youâ€™re so braveâ€? but what they donâ€™t realize is they can do what Iâ€™m doing and Iâ€™m not that brave.
Anyone traveling solo also knows this to be true.
What seems so simple to me now but I didnâ€™t put enough emphasis on before is the fact that we get only one shot at life and pursuing major dreams is not just important itâ€™s a necessity.
Yet so many people donâ€™t end up trying the very thing they most wish they could in life for fear of failure.
The whole point is to realize itâ€™s never a failure but a series of steps forward and inevitably a few backwards.
4 Your profound realizations will make you sound like an a**hole Any time someone praises you for following your dreams youâ€™ll be forced to tell them they could do the same thing.
They too could simply do whatever the heck they want.
Theyâ€™ll stare back at you in disbelief and youâ€™ll feel like youâ€™re on a soap box.
Then youâ€™ll step down sheepishly.
5 Friends and family become much more precious My mom says that these days she sees me more than when I was living in California only 45 minutes away.
Now when I come home I stay with her and each year she has visited me for a week or two during my travels.
My best friends from back home also take time off of work and plan group trips when Iâ€™m home.
A couple of them have even visited me in Thailand during the coup dâ€™etat no less.
Iâ€™ve also seen friends Iâ€™ve met traveling over and over in different countries and continents.
We make effort to see each other because we made lasting friendships.
Youâ€™ll meet people from all over the world and while youâ€™ll say goodbye a lot youâ€™ll also have the opportunity to hang out with a friend in just about every city you visit.
This is an incredible gift.
6 People will rely on you less By juxtaposition the fact that youâ€™re always leaving always moving and never letting yourself stay in one place for long will make you less of a long-term prospect in many peopleâ€™s lives.
This is particularly true for romantic relationships.
Itâ€™s hard to take someone seriously who will always leave which results in a lot of heartbreak and goodbyes.
7 Thereâ€™s no cure-all no perfect lifestyle and no answer to all of your problems People think riches are the answer until they become rich think fame is the answer until they become famous and think traveling will be the perfect lifestyle change until they realize that no lifestyle is without its pitfalls.
It can be a bitter pill to swallow.
8 Home will be harder to find With so many options constantly presenting themselves and by returning to the place where you grew up with a new perspective it will be harder to feel at home in any one place.
This inevitable byproduct of traveling is a double-edged sword because youâ€™ll end up falling in love with many places while simultaneously wondering if you could ever really settle in one place.
9 If you canâ€™t be a chameleon it wonâ€™t be easy Master the art of blending in! Unless you can embrace the differences in each friend group culture and overall lifestyle where youâ€™re living it wonâ€™t be an easy road.
When Iâ€™m traveling I realize that things will not be as clean timetables will probably not exist and the people Iâ€™m around will more likely be from different cultures with very little in common with how I grew up.
Back home I realize that image matters more and I canâ€™t just walk around without makeup or western-style clothing on if I want to be treated with respect.
Traveling successfully means that in order to fit in and appreciate each place you have to change a little bit each time.
Some would say this means not being true to yourself but in reality itâ€™s just letting different parts of your personality show.
10 Youâ€™ll never be the same again Normalcy will be almost impossible to grasp.
Reverse culture shock will be real.
Assimilating to the world of non-travelers should you ever decide to become one again will be more difficult than you ever imagined.
In closing traveling opens a lot of doors promotes the opportunity to have amazing and eye-opening experiences in beautiful places and exposes you to all kinds of amazing people.
It also means a lot of changes to your lifestyle and sense of self.
Like anything it can be both good and bad.
All that said I wouldnâ€™t trade it for the world.

Another one I would add is that everything at home will seem the same- it will feel like youâ€™ve changed a ton but everyone back home is frozen in place.
At least for me.
Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 257 pm Definitely.
Somehow it all seems the same yet everything changes.
Reply Charlie says 10/20/2014 at 115 pm Hells yes.
Many of these ring true to me from years as an expat especially #5 #6 and #9.
Travelling or more living in different countries in my case has made me more confident stronger and know myself better but I expect and hope to find more of #2 and #3 within myself on my RTW trip in January.
Great post! Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 255 pm RTW trips are amazing.
Have a blast girl! Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 258 pm I really struggle with it too.
Finding Berlin has helped but I know Iâ€™m at the mercy of the people at the visa office so itâ€™s just not a 100% viable option.
Best of luck with you search ð?™‚ Reply Ashton says 10/20/2014 at 652 pm Hey Kristin always cool to see how travel affects others.
Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll cross paths somewhere in the world.
Best to you! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 802 am â€¦and to you! Reply Christie says 10/21/2014 at 215 am This is such a great list.
Although I am not travelling solo so many of these resonate with me.
Particularly #1 Iâ€™m learning that I can be really selfish when travelling with my partner and its totally something I need to work on! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 802 am I do as well! Reply Franca says 10/21/2014 at 503 am Itâ€™s so true that once you start travelling itâ€™s hard to think at a particular place as home at least it is for me.
Me and Dale have been on the road for more than 2 years with no intention to stop any time soon but we would like to have a base where we can return to the problem is where? Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 801 am I have a few places that could be a base at least I think so.
Testing my theory! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 800 am I love that about it too.
The way it presents challenges but also builds the kind of person who can overcome them.
Reply Megan says 10/21/2014 at 557 pm I was going to list the points that jumped out at me but then I realised that would be all ten! Although Iâ€™ve had some personal experience with #4 lately.
Opps.
I was about the send the link to a friend whoâ€™s in the should I travel or shouldnâ€™t Iâ€? boat so she knowâ€™s just whatâ€™s in store and how awesome it is but I think only people who have experienced this themselves really understand.
Reply Kristin says 10/24/2014 at 943 am She definitely should do it! Reply Nichelle says 10/23/2014 at 604 am Great post! There are really good changes and not so good ones about long-term travel.
But at the end of the day itâ€™s you who decide how you are gonna react with those changes.
Reply Kristin says 10/24/2014 at 937 am Definitely Reply Sand In My Suitcase says 10/23/2014 at 835 am So true about how friends and family become more and more important â€“ they ground us -.
We find that each time we return from a trip we examine our daily lives back home and try to make some personal changes that would make us happier e.g.
after Europe do we want to live right in the city where we can walk everywhere rather than someplace where we need a car? Reply Fabiana says 10/24/2014 at 545 pm Great post! I might do a similar one on my blog.
Reply Rose says 10/25/2014 at 423 pm Hello Kristin! Iâ€™ve been following your blog and itâ€™s been incredibly inspiring.
I have a question I noticed earlier on in your blogging career you used a pseudonym called Ava Apollo.
What was the reason behind this and why did you decide to go back to your real name? Thank you! Reply Renuka says 10/26/2014 at 317 am Nice read! Travel definitely brings a positive change in an individual.
In my case it has made me more tolerant of life.
I have learnt to value life more value people more.
I have learnt to be less emotional and more practical.
ð?™‚ Most of all I have become a better person.
Reply Kristin says 10/26/2014 at 432 am I really agree with that a lot.
I have more compassion and more easily tolerate others who might slightly annoy me without meaning to.
Reply Stephen & Jess says 10/26/2014 at 547 am Great post â€“ thanks for sharing you stories.
Do you ever find that sharing too many stories of travel with friends can lead to an almost â€˜boastingâ€™ feel? Even though you arenâ€™t purposely trying to boast and instead just wanting to share your stories.
Btw just talking generally â€“ not pointed at anyone in anyway  Reply Kristin says 10/26/2014 at 608 am I guess thatâ€™s why I kept this blog in the first place because those who want to know will come here to read it and those who donâ€™t arenâ€™t obliged to hear my stories.
I find that those who are genuinely curious will ask specific questions and those who arenâ€™t will just say things like how was your trip?â€? and all they really want to hear is it was good.â€? Reply Stephen & Jess says 10/27/2014 at 310 am Thatâ€™s so true totally agree with you and I think that is why we started our blog.
Never thought about the whole â€˜how was your tripâ€™ thing.
Reply Lily Lau says 10/29/2014 at 1229 pm Youâ€™re rightâ€¦ itâ€™s incredible how travelling changes you so much until making you a complete different person.
Even the loved ones change and you consider others your family.
Thatâ€™s sad for the ones who stay home and see how others could achieve in days what they had to work for years and years of friendship and patience.
Itâ€™s unfair but true.
Nice post.
Reply Kristin says 10/29/2014 at 239 pm I definitely grew a lot more this year and learned how to let go but there are probably also things where I took a step backwards since the nature of relationships changes when moving around so quickly.
Itâ€™s an interesting concept and I am learning more about myself all the time as a result.
Reply Oliver says 11/02/2014 at 433 am I really like your blog and especially this article motivates a lot! Someday Iâ€™ll give it a try for myself.
Keep it up! I just hope you dont turn into a loner ð?™‚ The pink suit guy Reply Kristin says 11/02/2014 at 437 am Itâ€™s impossible to be a loner when you have friends all over the world ð?™‚ Thanks for the kind words.
Reply Katie says 11/02/2014 at 645 pm It has definitely made me more confident and I noticed it when I went home for the 1st time.
Making all those decisions instead of letting others do it for me made me a lot more comfortable with the prospect of dealing with the outcomes which were not as scary as I had initially thought.
Reply Kristin says 11/03/2014 at 1254 am Thatâ€™s so true.
Knowing that youâ€™re in charge makes it less scary even though it seems like the opposite would be true.
Reply Ryan Biddulph says 11/04/2014 at 428 pm Hi Kristin I went from shy struggling largely not too happy guy to someone whoâ€™ll be speaking at NYU in a month.
I went from unknown blogger to a guy whose eBooks have been endorsed by a New York Times Best Selling Author.
Your post is spot on and I know first hand that traveling changes your life like you couldnâ€™t believe! Nobody knows how travel will change them but if youâ€™re open and willing to be uncomfortable youâ€™ll slowly free yourself.
Youâ€™ll become who you were born to be because youâ€™ll stop being the person your friends and fam want you to be and youâ€™ll be you.
At home in NJ I was Ryan the office worker then Ryan the pier guard who watches sports and hangs out on the weekends.
Traveling all over the world my ego view of self was shattered.
I became who my intuition told me to be which is why Iâ€™ll be speaking at NYU teaching folks how to live the digital nomad lifestyle and itâ€™s also why Iâ€™ve received the humbling endorsements from a world renowned author and biz coach.
LOVING each of your points Kristin.
Tweeting this from Bali ð?˜‰ Thanks for sharing! Ryan Reply Kristin says 11/05/2014 at 502 am Thatâ€™s awesome Ryan! I completely agree that without external influences from people who have always been in your life you suddenly shed the fear of being yourself which is wonderful and essential.
Enjoy Bali ð?™‚ Reply Dana Wanted Adventure says 11/24/2014 at 721 am I could relate to several of these but especially number 8! I always try to explain that I live in this limbo-life where no matter where I am Iâ€™m missing my otherâ€? home somewhere out there in the world and when Iâ€™m at one of those homes Iâ€™m at the way time missing not traveling around somewhere! lol Reply Kristin says 11/24/2014 at 745 am Totally! you leave pieces of yourself behind everywhere.
Itâ€™s the beauty of having home everywhere but the difficulty of not really feeling at home anywhere.
