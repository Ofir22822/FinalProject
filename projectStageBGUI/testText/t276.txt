We drove through some small villages and some nice vineyards.
We stopped at one Chateau but it was closed for the season.
We took a few photos and headed on our way.
On the north loop we found another Chateau to visit.
This one was quite different in that the owner had 80 jet fighters on display outside.
Inside he had a collection of Abarth race cars and at least 300 old motorcycles dating back to the very early 1900s.
He also had about 2000 airplane models and another 1000 motorcycle and car models on display.
There were also several furnished rooms to see.
While we were there 3 Ferraris and 3 Maseratis drove up and parked next to the Chateau.
They were from England and were on an escorted tour.
The most interesting car was a Ferrari F40.
Basically its a race car that has been made street legal.
It can do over 200mph easily.
It had to be 3 feet wider than our car.
I dont know how he got it down the narrow The roof of the car and us streets of the village.
The next morning we got packed and headed to Colmar.
Today is Stacys 67th birthday.
Happy Birthday Stacy! Colmar is a quaint village with a lot of old half timbered houses in it.
We parked the car in an underground parking lot and headed out to look around.
We visited the Dominican church and the Cathedral St.
Martin.
Then we walked over to the tanners quarter where they used to tan leather hides in the 17th and 18th century.
Then over to petite Venice a series of canals that were dug so that all of the towns people could have equal access to water.
We had lunch by the old market hall.
We stopped at the Unterlinden Museum for a look see.
We headed back to our parking garage to get the car.
We could not find it.
It was a huge garage and in our haste to go out and look around we forgot to see where we had parked it.
We thought that we went back in the same entrance that we came out of but the car wasnt where I thought it should be.
We walked halfway down each isle looking for The Chateau again it.
I thought that for a moment  maybe someone had stolen it.
But we finally looked all the way down the rows and there it was.
Thank goodness!! The entrance at each end looked identical.
We took off and drove toward our next stop which was Strasbourg.
We hit some very heavy traffic.
It was stop and go on the freeway for about 5 miles.
The GPS said it could save us a half hour if we took a different route so we did that.
Apparently everybody elses GPS told them the same thing.
We spent a good hour in bumper to bumper traffic until we got to our hotel.
It is a very nice room though the biggest room we have ever had in Europe.
Tomorrow we look around Strasbourg and on Sunday we head for Verdun.
