These boltholes either have no electricity no roads or theyâ€™re remote enough to render â€˜Do not disturbâ€™ signs pointless.
A cabin in a barley field East England View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sawdays Canopy & Stars @canopyandstars on Jul 22 2015 at 102pm PDT Thereâ€™s no electricity to power this wooden cabin hidden amid crops of sugar beets and barley near the magical north Norfolk coast in the east of England.
Candles and lanterns light up the cosy interior while moonlight stars and a fire pit illuminate the private deck.
The Woodcock scores extra romance points for the lovingly handcrafted wooden king-sized bed locally sewn curtains hanging from a locally forged curtain rail and mismatched crockery sourced from local antique shops.
Best of all is the huge bath warmed by a wood-fired heater.
Alternatively if youre feeling brave thereâ€™s always the outdoor shower...
A loch-side guesthouse Scottish Highlands View this post on Instagram A post shared by Skiary @skiary_scotland on Nov 14 2018 at 813am PST The all-inclusive Skiary Guesthouse is tucked away on the road-free shores of Loch Hourn.
To reach â€˜Scotlandâ€™s Wildest Guesthouseâ€™ you can walk for 35 minutes from the end of the road or organise a ride in the ownersâ€™ little motorboat.
Instead of electricity and mobile phones entertainment comes via board games home-cooked meals and good old-fashioned conversation.
And whisky naturally.
The whole place is lit by paraffin-fuelled lamps or candles and is warmed by a driftwood-burning stove.
While youâ€™re there drift across the loch in a rowing boat spot seals and red deer amble hand-in-hand along the loch-side paths or stretch your legs on a hill walk.
A cliff-top lighthouse Shetland Islands Scotland View this post on Instagram A post shared by Darwin on the rocks @darwinontherocks on Feb 25 2018 at 112pm PST As an automated lighthouse Eshaness needs electricity but as far as location is concerned this place is seriously off-grid.
It perches on the top of sheer cliffs on the western edge of the Shetland Islands the most northerly place in Britain at 962 miles north of London and 400 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
Inside the lighthouse is warm and cosy but itâ€™s the 360Â° views that make this place so romantic.
There are no visible neighbours and the only noises youâ€™ll hear are the powerful Atlantic waves pounding the cliffs below and the gannets and skuas soaring overhead.
If youâ€™re lucky you might spot whales breaching the endless sea.
Hope for an almighty storm for an excuse to cuddle up even closer.
An 18th-century retreat Wales View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ben @ben.forshaw on Jan 23 2016 at 808am PST Tune in to a simpler time in Bryn Eglur â€“ a cute-as-a-button traditional Welsh smallholderâ€™s cottage in a remote part of Wales.
Built in 1775 the tiny rooms have been carefully restored with just a few subtle modern conveniences added such as a roll-top bath and underfloor heating after all it would be considerably less romantic without! Mobile phone reception is patchy at best and thereâ€™s no internet access.
Instead you get Welsh wool blankets a grandfather clock and a wrought iron bedframe.
Cook on a solid-fuel Rayburn stove cuddle up in front of the inglenook fireplace and fill your days with romantic walks and your nights with stargazing.

An island escape Southwest England View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bruce Taylor @roolerworks on Feb 24 2018 at 422am PST Admittedly bunk beds arenâ€™t the most amorous of sleeping arrangements but this self-catering cottageâ€™s romance factor is amped up by its location.
Originally a signal-and-watch station for boats Tibbets occupies the second highest point on tiny Lundy Island just off the north coast of Devon.
Itâ€™s one of a few places to stay on Lundy but timber-floored and matchboard-lined Tibbets is the most remote and the only one without electricity.
Ramble the islandâ€™s rocky shores snorkel or scuba the clear waters of the Lundy Marine Conservation Zone spot puffins sika deer and Lundy ponies and try to count up to 14 lighthouses twinkling in the distance.
