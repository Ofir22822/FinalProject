We look at the different options for extending your travels upwards to the bonnie Highlands.
1.
By train Scotland is well-connected with London thanks to the UKâ€™s excellent extensive rail network.
For example the train journey from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh can take as little as 4 hours 20 minutes and cost as low as Â£40 one way if you book in advance.
Regular rail services also run to Glasgow 4hrs 30mins Dundee 5hrs 50mins Aberdeen 7hrs Inverness 8hrs with connections to regional stops too.
Useful websites for booking train tickets to Scotland Buy as far in advance as you can to get the best prices - use websites like The Trainline or direct with the rail operators for this route Virgin Trains and East Coast.
Rail passes A BritRail GB Pass offers unlimited rail travel on any train service in Britain.
A flexible version is also available.
2.
By sleeper train Yes thatâ€™s right â€“ there is a way to travel in the UK where in the evening hub-bub of London you can board a train wine and dine in a sedate lounge car that echoes of yesteryear before retiring to your cosy compartment for a restorative nightâ€™s sleep.
You wake up the next morning with a cup of tea brought by your steward then look out the window to see youâ€™re in the Highlands with deer running beside the track.
The Caledonian Sleeper train runs from London Euston to the heart of Scotland every night of the week apart from Saturdays and there are reclining seats for a cheaper alternative to the compartments.
A most civilised way to travel! The sleeper train takes 13 hours from London Euston to Fort William â€“ a great spot from which to explore the Highlands.
There are also services to Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and Aberdeen.
Useful websites for planning your snooze cruise See the Caledonian Sleeper website also read London to Scotland by sleeper by the Man in Seat 61.
You can also book tickets on the National Rail website and The Trainline as well as at any railway station in Britain.
3.
By car Maybe the more laborious option but youâ€™ll have the freedom to stop where you like and could break up the journey taking in some other amazing areas of the UK.
The Lake District serves as a perfect mid-way stopping point and will warm you up for the mountains of Scotland.
This could also work out as the cheaper of the options if you share the journey with others and split the cost of fuel.
The drive from central London to Glasgow takes around 7hrs to Edinburgh around 7hrs 30mins and to Inverness around 10hrs 30mins.
4.
By coach National Express runs from London Victoria Coach Station regularly throughout the day with journey times of 8hrs 15mins to Glasgow 9hrs to Edinburgh and 12hrs 35mins to Inverness.
