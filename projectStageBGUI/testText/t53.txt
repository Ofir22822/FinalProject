The Brecon Beacons National Park is a beautiful area to explore typically British rolling green hills and picturesque villages.
Donâ€™t miss a pint with the locals in a great traditional pub.
Be sure to stop by the characterful town of Hay-on-Wye which has a distinctly literary feel due to its famous annual book festival.
Books galore in Hay-on-Wye What else is near there? You could easily combine a trip to Wales with an exploration of West England that it borders.
