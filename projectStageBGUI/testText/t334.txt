We arrive in Paris at 6.40 am and take the airport shuttle to Gare de Nord railway station.
The railway station is large and there are soldiers armed with machine guns roaming the station.
Here we find the luggage storage area where we leave our bags in a locker before catching a train to Amiens.
One thing we notice is that there a lot of people with dogs boarding trains and are impressed that the french are pet firendly.
At Amiens we find out from the information booth outside the station how to get to Villers Bretonneux.
We have lunch while we are waiting for the train then head to Villiers.
In the First World War on 24 April 1918 the small town of Villers-Bretonneux was the site of the worlds first battle between two tank forces three British Mark IVs against three German A7Vs.
The Germans took the town but that night and the next day it was recaptured by 4th and 5th Division of the AIF at a cost of over twelve hundred Australian lives.
The people of Villers-Bretonneux remain indebted to Australia for this feat.
The towns mayor spoke of the Australian troops on 14 July 1919 when unveiling a memorial in their honour The Australian War Memorial in France is located in Villers-Bretonneux and in front of it lie the graves of over 770 Australian soldiers as well as those of other British Empire soldiers involved in the campaign.
The school in Villers-Bretonneux was rebuilt using donations from school children of Victoria Australia many of whom had relatives perish in the towns liberation and above every blackboard is the inscription Noublions jamais lAustralie Never forget Australia.
The annual ANZAC Day ceremony is held at this village on Anzac Day 25 April each year.
Traditionally Australian commemorations have focussed on Gallipoli.
We walked through the town to the Memorial at the local school.
After looking through the school we walked through the village to the top of the hill and could see the War Memorial in the dstance but decided it was too far to walk.
There were no taxis or buses so walking was the only option.
We had hoped to go to Bullecourte for the ANZAC Day service which was to be held at 3 pm but after asking the locals we discovered it was 70 klms away.
With no transport options we headed back to the railway station to find it abandoned and could not find anyone to tell us when the next train was.
We went back to the scholl and asked them to ring a taxi.
The nearest taxi was at Amiens about 50 klms away.
When we arrive in Amiens we walk to the Notre Dame Basillica which we could see earlier from the railway station.
The basillica is impressive and we are amazed that it withstood the war without any serious damage.
The Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens French CathÃ©drale Notre-Dame dAmiens or simply Amiens Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral and seat of the Bishop of Amiens currently Jean-Luc Bouilleret.
It is situated on a slight ridge overlooking the River Somme in the administrative capital of the Picardy region of France some 120 km north of Paris.
The cathedral is the tallest complete cathedral in France its stone-vaulted nave reaching a height of 42.30 m surpassed only by the incomplete Beauvais Cathedral.
It also has the greatest interior volume of any French cathedral estimated at 200000 mÂ³.
The cathedral was built between 1220 and c.1270 and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981.
Although it has lost most of its original stained glass Amiens Cathedral is renowned for the quality and quantity of early 13th century Gothic sculpture in the main west facade and the south transept portal and a large quantity of polychrome sculpture from later periods inside the building.
Amiens cathedral contains the largest medieval interior in Western Europe supported by 126 pillars.
Both the nave and the chancel are vast but extremely light with considerable amounts of stained glass surviving despite the depredations of war.
The ambulatory surrounding the choir is richly decorated with polychrome sculpture and flanked by numerous chapels.
One of the most sumptuous is the Drapers chapel.
The cloth industry was the most dynamic component of the medieval economy especially in northern France and the cloth merchants were keen to display their wealth and civic pride.
Another striking chapel is dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury a 13th century dedication that complements the cathedrals own very full list of martyrs.
The interior contains works of art and decoration from every period since the building of the cathedral.
We leave Amiens and head back to Paris where we collect our luggage from the storage area and find our way through winding tunnels and turnstiles to the train to Grenelle where our apartment is.
We arrive at the apartment early in the evening.
The apartment is surrounded by shops and restaurants so we go down to a local restaurant for tea.
