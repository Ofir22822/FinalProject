In the 2nd century BC Pomorie was named Anchialus.
In 45 Anchialus became part of the Roman Empire.
The town expanded during the 2nd century when it was moved to a new place in Paleocastro Area.
The period during which Anchialus was part of the Roman Empire was marked by powerful progress.
The economic and political development of the town was proven by the fact that it started to mint coins.
The nymph cult was extremely widespread during this period.
According to local people the so-called Anchialic nymphs were three girls who inhabited the mountains the forests and the rivers.
They were regarded as goddesses â€“ protectors of springs.
This cult was related to the nearby Aqua Kalide mineral springs â€“ the modern-day Burgas mineral baths which were called Anchialus baths.
The town was visited personally by the rulers of the Roman Empire as great celebrations were held on 28 October 294 in honour of the visit of Emperor Diocletian.
The town retained its strategic position in the Middle Ages.
Oftentimes its region became a scene of violent battles between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines and the control over the town switched many times from one camp to the other.
In 1453 Anchialus was conquered by the Ottomans.
During the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century the coastal town functioned as an administrative centre.
The town was liberated from the Ottoman rule on 7 February 1878.
Anchialus continued to develop after the Liberation â€“ the local people engaged in vine-growing wine production fishing salt production etc.
