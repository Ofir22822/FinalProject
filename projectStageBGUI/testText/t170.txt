This UNESCO World Natural Heritage site covers an area of around 11000 square kilometres and includes the three Wadden Sea National Parks of Schleswig-Holstein Lower Saxony Hamburg and Denmark plus the Wadden Sea conservation area in the Netherlands.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Mussel beds dense sea grass meadows and soft mudflats provide food for many animals.
Flowering salt marshes in the transitional zone along the dykes and on the islands and Hallig islets give way to white sandy beaches and dunes.
For millions of migratory birds the Wadden Sea is an essential stopover or resting place.
Geologically it is a very young area only 10000 years old and is constantly being re-shaped by the winds and tides.
High and low tide alternate every six hours transforming the landscape as if by magic.
You can witness this at any time of year! The changing water levels make it possible to walk right out onto the mudflats and across to the islands that lie just off the coast.
On a walk through the mudflats ideally with an experienced guide you can feel the interaction of wind water and waves and watch huge flocks of birds demonstrating their aerial prowess.
In the distance you can sometimes even watch seals sunning themselves on a sandbank.
