Sunday is a slow and lazy day in Barcelona.
People tend to sleep in late.
The streets were quiet taxis and uber were hard to find.
Finally after a half an hour of wait we were able to get a taxi and headed to the port and boarded our cruise ship.
Symphony of the Sea a big awesome ship.
We were excited to get on board once inside it felt like you were in another city.
This ship is magnificent we felt like okay if we want to get lost this is the place to be! People were up and about restaurants everywhere elevators going up and down nonstop then you start to wonder and hope that there are enough of them to take care of all us.
Whats the first thing you do after youve checked into your room? Thats right hit the buffet! Loads of food to satisfy your craving.
Let me leave _DSC0639-Edit the food part out for a while I will fill you in on the culinary part of the cruise when we disembark.
If you havent been to Central Park well this is your chance to see it or at least a little portion of it.
All the specialty restaurant are located in the park.
They have this awesome guitar player to entertain you while youre hanging in the area or waiting around for dinner reservation.
Then theres the pool area in 15th floor.
Soooo many pools to hold 5500 passengers Theres kids jacuzzis adult jacuzzis waterslides dont even know what the other gadgets are called but they are all here! Did I mention you can do rock climbing here too? Do you want to learn to scuba dive.
Come on over they have that for you too! 5th Floor the Royal Promonade The shopping mecca aboard the ship also has a Starbucks bars pizzaria cafe and pastries BTW did I tell you they have their own boardwalk in here with a carousel hotdog stand arcade and lots more.
