Following the great call for projects in the name of Reinventing the Seine ideas abound and projects flourish in Paris to show off the banks of the Seine.
The major issues of this large-scale project are the protection of biodiversity and new uses for the river banks.
These five projects rely on innovation and will make us change our view of the Seine! With the Reinventing the Seine project nearly 35 sites in the cities of Le Havre Paris and Rouen have come together to undertake a major renovation of the entire Seine Valley.
Following concepts of sustainablity the river thus becomes the coherent link of a new metropolis that is part of the transformation of Greater Paris.
The challenge is to give the Seine the vitality it deserves with more accessible banks making it a real space to live share and exchange.
