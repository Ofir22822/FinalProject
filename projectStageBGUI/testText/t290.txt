In fact we had just about given up hope of seeing a familiar face when we pulled into the car park of the Peterborough Visitors Centre and nearly ran Dave over.
We had morning tea with Dave Clare Michael and Tim and spent a nice couple of hours in Peterborough.
It has the largest hall in inland South Australia no less.
It also has quite a bit of interesting railway history but we couldnâ€™t linger so we left all that for another day.
Broken Hill on the decline from its halcyon days as the site of the richest silver-lead-zinc lode in the world is quite a nice place with a real mixture Broken Hill - Flying Doctor of things to see.
We looked in on the School of the Air mainly because Sharonâ€™s sister Jeanette used to be principal there.
We sat in on a kindergarten lesson which for us novices was quite a hoot.
We also spoke to one of the staff members who remembered Jeanette most fondly.
The Royal Flying Doctor Service has a base in Broken Hill.
The tour was interesting enough and the short film is a real tear-jerker.
Apart that is from the dental patient.
A pleasant friendly old bushie he seems quite ok until he opens his mouth to reveal the most revolting set of crooked stained bleeding and decayed stumps you will ever see.
The mining connection we covered firstly with a trip out to the Daydream Mine and an underground tour.
Interestingly the pioneer miners didnâ€™t need to have room to lie down in their sleeping quarters â€“ they were generally so riddled with lung disease that they could only sleep sitting up anyway.
The second part of our mine experience was a visit to the Minersâ€™ Memorial perched on the top of the giant mullock heap that has replaced the Barrier Range in the Broken Hill - Miners Memorial middle of town.
The memorial lists all the employees who have died on the job at the mines â€“ from the first cases of lead poisoning to a veritable epidemic of heart attacks in the 1960â€™s to the odd crushed by machineâ€? or electrocutedâ€? these days.
It was certainly a hard way to earn a living from the time of the Daydream Mine right through to the present day.
To cover the absolute cornucopia of attractions on offer we also had a malted at Bellâ€™s Milk Bar stuck in the 60â€™s and with an interesting milk bar museum attached looked in at the Palace Hotel made famous in Priscilla Queen of the Desertâ€? and drove out to the Sculptures in the Desert and the old town of Silverton.
From there it was an easy drive to Nyngan for a night then Armidale then home.
We covered 9700 kilometres in just over 5 weeks and were really surprised at how easy the trip was.
The old commodore did it with ease and an ever-increasing number of rattles.
The drinking water and engine oil we carried as a precaution remained untouched.
While we didnâ€™t venture far away from Broken Hill - Bells Milk Bar civilization we did get a good taste of a unique part of the country â€“ a part that every city-dweller should visit.
And do it soon as there are a lot of visitors.
Some of the rest stops especially those that donâ€™t have a toilet are starting to show the effect of too many overnight camps.
Perhaps people will be needed soon to direct the hoards of grey nomads and yes we are not far from that category ourselves around the country perhaps with some sort of one-way system.
Our next instalment will be in a few weeks â€“ somewhere overseas but weâ€™re not sure exactly where.
Weâ€™ll keep you posted.

Thanks for more great pics! And no I havent forgotten how to read so I DID read the text.
Sounds like youre having a ball during the gap-year.
Do you reckon youll ever go back to work and pay taxes again? Somebodys got to keep Australia running right? Can you let me know how to find the comments etc that other folks and you make? I cant seem to find them any more.
Continue to have fun! Jack.
30th September 2011 Jack non-member comment Nguzu-nguzu I had to look at this twice to check that I was seeing right.
This looks remarkably like a Nguzu-nguzu.
Throughout the Solomon Islands - all provinces- there are representations usually carved in wood of Nguzu-nguzu the shark god who theoretically protects people.
I dont think it works.
i had been swimming in a particular area and asked if there were sharks.
Nope.
No sharks and Nguzu-nguzu will protect you anyway.
Following week a small ferry with 96 people went down in the same area and all of them were eaten by Nguzu-nguzus.
Yep....
that one worked!
