Normandy is home to one of the wonders of the Western world.
A jewel of French heritage set on its own rocky island in an enormous bay Mont-Saint-Michel.
Normandy is a world of picturesque villages with cobbled streets and Gothic churches all of which were sources of inspiration for Impressionist painter Claude Monet.
But Normandy also has its eye on the future in hi-tech cities like Le Havre.
Come on letâ€™s go...
Not to miss sights in Normandy Â© Dan Wilding / Unsplash â€” Mont-Saint-Michel a must-see during your stay in Normandy.
â€¢ Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay Originally in 709 this rock was occupied by a simple little church.
Over the centuries an abbey convent buildings surrounding walls and a village were erected to make Mont Saint-Michel a spiritual and intellectual home in addition to a place of pilgrimage.
Witnessing the island monastary emerge from the bay between sea and sky is breathtaking in its majestic beauty.
â€¢ The planks of Deauville This storied wood walk is mythical dating from 1923 and bordering the Art Deco style bath cabins along the beach.
How many stars have walked on these 643 meters 2010 feet? JosÃ©phine Baker Buster Keaton Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk AimÃ©e in A Man and a Woman not to mention the stars of the American Film Festival.
Today its still the place to see and be seen.
â€¢ The landing beaches On June 6 1944 the beaches of Normandy were the historical theater of the great military operation which mobilized an armada of boats and planes to free France from the German occupation.
Museums and cemeteries line this coast from Sword Beach to Ouistreham Juno Beach to Courseulles-sur-Mer Gold Beach to Arromanches Omaha Beach to Colleville-sur-Mer Utah Beach to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and to the Pointe du Hoc in Cricqueville-en Bessin.
â€¢ The Caen Memorial This memorial retraces the period before and after 1945 reviving D-Day the Battle of Normandy World War and the Cold War.
This is a touching dive into the heart of the 20th century.
â€¢ The cliffs of Ã‰tretat They stand out from the Alabaster Coast like three vertical limestone soldiers marching into the sea.
The Manneporte Courtine and Aiguille which have inspired so many painters are visible from the shoreline from a boat or from a path overlooking the Channel.
â€¢ Le Havre and its post World War II architecture About 80% destroyed during the Second World War the city was rebuilt by the architect Auguste Perret specialist in reinforced concrete.
It is necessary to see his achievements in brick and morter calibrated and harmonious like the town hall St Josephs Church and its tower of 110 meters 360 feet and the Peret appartments typical of the 1950s.
Altogether they are all listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
â€¢ Notre-Dame Cathedral in Evreux Built between the 10th and 13th centuries the imposing cathedral retains both a Romanesque and Gothic style.
Its 70 stained glass windows some of which are made with the famous Yellow Evreux silver salt dazzle every visitor without fail.
â€¢ Gros Horloge and Rouen Cathedral The Gros Horloge is a beautiful Renaissance pavilion spanning the street and sporting a clock face.
From the platform of the belfry those brave enough to climb it are rewarded with a panoramic view of the roofs of old Rouen.
Look up a bit further to spy the Gothic towers of the superb cathedral which house the namesake organ of Richard the Lionheart.
â€¢ The small port of Dieppe Strolling on the port of Dieppe one is plunged back into the luminous landscapes of Turner Pissaro or Gauguin all subjugated by the colors of the houses which are reflected in the water and by the animation of the quays between two fishing rafts.
â€¢ The pretty village of Veules-les-Roses Plan a stop in this seaside resort of the Pays de Caux brimming with old-fashioned charm which nestled along the Veules the smallest river in France at 1149 meters 3770 feet long! Between the sea and the countryside the village and its mills ensared Victor Hugo Paul Meurice and the painter Camille Marchand.

â€¢ Discover Monets impressions at Giverny Resettling 1883 in a house in Giverny on the right bank of the Seine the painter Claude Monet was inspired by his gardens to paint his finest works such as the series of 250 NymphÃ©as.
Today the village retains its impressionist touch thanks to the many artists who live there.
â€¢ Get lost at night in the Mont-Saint-Michel abbey In the summer when night falls follow the abbeys trail of mysteries...did you really see that peregrine falcon nestling in the spire or did your imagination play tricks on you? Regardless the night route allows you to discover the architecture and magic of the monastary under the velvet blanket of darkness.
â€¢ In Ã‰tretat golf cart and golf clubs are waiting for you The Etretat golf course is perched at the top of the cliffs overlooking the bay.
For 110 years the course has been demanding and the view impregnable especially on hole number 10! Check out what you need to know about golf in Normandy here.
â€¢ Put on your best hat to attend a horse race Normandy is a breeding ground for horses and stud farms.
Come and cheer on the champions in full gallop at the racetracks of Deauville or Cabourg.
Connoisseurs from around the world come to admire the finest thoroughbreds and the best jockeys.
Place your bets! â€¢ Drooling for Honfleur mussels and fries In Honfleur enjoy strolling around the Vieux Bassin lined with tall narrow houses crowned with slate roofs or criss-cross the alleys of the medieval district of LEnclos.
Of course you have to visit the Sainte Catherine church hewn totally in wood and the MusÃ©e EugÃ¨ne Boudin who hails from this part of France.
Not to mention the mussels and friesâ€”its the taste of Honfleur! â€¢ Feel growing in front of the Cherbourg harbor Imagine almost 4 kilometers 2.5 miles of pier in open sea facing the city an artificial harbor created to defend the city against the English.
Begun under Louis XVI and finished under Napoleon III as with several military forts today this technical feat effectively protects the port from sea erosion.
â€¢ Visit the Bayeux Military Cemetery The largest British cemetery in France is a place of memory which contains more than 4600 graves of soldiers of 11 different nationalities killed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944.
â€¢ Tour the Grand Dukes in Deauville Deauville has always been a festive resort and it lives up to its reputation today! To start the evening head for an iconic bistro serving seafood or a vintage-style brewery or splurge on a grand hotel bar.
Then head to the casino where you can try your luck at roulette poker and the 300 slot machines.
Finally shake it off at one of Deauvilles clubs beloved by the stars of yesterday.
â€¢ Immerse yourself in the incredible collection of MUMA in Le Havre In a concrete and glass building inaugurated in 1961 the AndrÃ© Malraux Museum of Modern Art exhibits one of the largest collections of Impressionist paintings thanks to the donation of HÃ©lÃ¨ne Senn-Foulds.
The museum is a playground of light setting off the subtle hues of Renoir Sisley Pissaro and Degas.
