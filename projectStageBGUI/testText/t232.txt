We went by car to the restaurant we ate before and had a good meal.
Lucky this time we went by car for the place was closed.
What now Back to the Hotel where we found out the only place to get something to eat was at Mc Donalds just over the road.
We parked the car and walked up there.
Now we had not been to Mac Donalds for ages so things had changed.
Not to forget menus are in are in the French language.
They are on a big screen where you point at the things you want.
Well we were at an absolute lost.
A girl that service gave us a few hints what to do but even with that help we were lost several times but in the end we did get a hambutger and chips.
No idea how we got it but were very happy..
After a good breakfast we decided to take the ski lift to the top of the mountain to enjoy the views that must be there.
To far top walk we took the car.
Easy parking there looks we were the 20190724_050904 only ones that go up.
We bought two tickets that will take you up in two stages and we wanted to go to the top.
We were told there are places there you can buy coffee.
All good.
Advise was given it could be cool up there.
so we took our rain jackets.
That was a waist of time for it was not cool at all when we arrived at the top.On stepping out the ski lift we saw no coffee shop anywhere.
Second fib.
Walking around there I could see a red roof and a few chairs but they were miles away and to get there you had to climb.
We started on it but after a while we thought we gave that a miss and enjoy the beautiful views that were around.
We finished up walking around and the seeing the views for they were absolutely beautiful.
the trip down was also spectacular which gave us an amount of video and pictures we could later enjoy.
Later that day going to the restaurant for our meal we had another miss.
It was closed again this time for it was Monday.
Ah well we heard there was a cafeteria 20190725_194820 Alphonse beer that was very good We gave that a try but they were not set up for tourists at all.
We had when we arrived make a choice out of a menu all in the French language.
We had no idea what it was and we asked the person that served who became very angry that we did not make a choice so we told him that we could not read it result of that was the walked of.
Lucky there was a person there that although in very little English offered the excuses for the behaviour of his boss and helped making a choice.
The meal was so sobut that happens.
This was the end of our visit to Briancone.Next day we left earlier as normal the trip to Colmar was 600 kilometers long and not driving toll toads we would need the time A wonderful trip it was.
We went over all sorts of roads and took the time to have a few stops.
Managed to get to Colmar in 9 hours was very good going driving country roads special the beginning going over the Alps.
Hard to pass as well the road was full with caravan and motor 20190724_203836 homes who were all there for the Tour de France that would come through there the next day.
We easy found the hotel in Colmar and arrived at 7 p.m.
We saw that Colmar was a real tourist place and very busy.
We had problems finding a place to eat for people had booked but a nice lad working in this place called  George place gave us a cosy corner where we enjoyed the nicest Entrecote we ever had.
We certainly will come back for some more in the next couple of days we are there.
Following day we saw why Colmar had so many tourist.
It is a lovely place with picture painting houses and streets who are never straight and covered with cobble stones.
Certainly a place to make beautiful pictures and video which we did.
A small stream runs through the city and for that reason it also is called little Venice.
We have to leave you here more about our trip next delivery.
Liz & Alphonse.
