The Durankulak Lake lies to the southeast of the village.
It is one of the most important and best- preserved ecosystems in Bulgaria with international importance for the protection of multiple rare and endangered plant and animal species.
The lake is located on the migration route Via Pontica and it provides a suitable place for nesting and wintering of multiple species of migratory birds.
The lake is detached from the sea by a thin sand line and two islands are located in its western part.
Exceptionally rich and interesting archaeological finds have been made on the western shore of the lake and the Large Island.
During archaeological excavations at the settlement mound of the Large Island in the Durankulak Lake a unique archaeological site had been found containing evidences of human presence dating back to the late Neolith the second half of the 6th millennium BC â€“ a settlement dating back to the late stone and copper age the late bronze and the beginning of the early iron age.
After a particular termination during the second half of the 9th century a Bulgarian settlement was established on the Large Island.
This is the largest archaeological site in Dobrudzha in which almost without any interruption the entire prehistory and a large part of the ancient and early medieval history of this part of Bulgaria is presented.
