Abu Dhabi! Next Entry Â» Advertisement Middle East Â» United Arab Emirates Â» Abu Dhabi Â» Jebel Dhanna November 10th 2011 Published November 13th 2011Edit Blog Post Aoife and Vinny Chillin by the pool! So after a lot of sad goodbyes myself and Vinny headed off on our travels First stop...
Abu Dhabi! We arrived at 7am to 30 degree weather and a lot of taxi touts! Ended up throwing our bags and then ourselves into a moving taxi that was pulling up illegally and so paid a little bit less to get to our hotel than a standard taxi!! We are backpackers now so every penny counts! We checked into five star luxury hotel the Sheraton I know I know we are supposed to be backpacking but got a really good deal through a friend! for some R n R and it was savage! After massive breakfast we headed to the pool where we slept for hours under a palm tree! Dinner in the hotel and an early night.
Day 2 involved more dozing by the pool so this blog entry will be short and sweet! Headed to a well-reviewed restaurant called the Lebanese Flower for some gorgeous chicken schawarmas and walked around Abu Dhabi trying to find somewhere that sold wine.
No such luck! Oh well the only downside so far to the Emirates! So far Abu Dhabi is not as impressive as Vinny having a cocktail! Dubai.
The entire city is under construction so much so that in many places there are no actual footpaths so you have to look out for cars and run! Our last day here involved more of the same lying out in the sun! We then headed to the bus station to get a bus to the airport! There is a muslim holiday tomorrow so the station was packed! Made it to the airport and onto a nice flight to Beijing! Oh and the chair in the airport that vinny was sitting in actually broke under his weight cos he was leaning in it akwardly!! So funny he was bit embarrassed and said shoddy workmanshipâ€? for about 5 mins but no one understood him!! Next stopâ€¦ Beijing! x Next Entry Â» Additional photos below Photos 11 Displayed 11 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Aoife and Vinny Aoife and Vinny So we have quit our jobs packed our bags and are heading off on our travels! First stop China then Vietnam Cambodia Thailand Malaysia Singapore Indonesia New Zealand and finally Australia! In the words of Mark Twain Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do.
So throw off the bowlines.
Sail away from the safe harbor.
Catch the trade winds in your sails.
Explore.
Dream.
