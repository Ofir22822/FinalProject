1.
Homemade afternoon tea A staple of British tradition afternoon tea is a quaint way to spend some much-needed alone time with your other half - but depending on where you go even the pot of tea itself can be expensive.

Long beach walks Britain is blessed with some of the worldâ€™s most picturesque coastlines meaning you neednâ€™t cross oceans to enjoy a barefoot stroll along a sandy beach.
From the elusive coves of Cornwall to Northumberlandâ€™s unspoilt coastal stretch youâ€™ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to a seaside timeout for two.

Whether itâ€™s the first date or the fifth culture and romance go hand-in-hand - as well as offering a perfect opportunity for you to get to know each other a little better.
4.
Picnics by sunset The warmer weather might still be a while off but with the sun setting earlier in the colder months itâ€™s the perfect excuse to wrap up warm and head outdoors.
Whether youâ€™re finishing an evening stroll with a coffee in the park or watching as the sun sets over the city make the most of your evenings by spending more time outside.
For some time away from the hustle and bustle of modern life nothing says romance like your very own private sunset viewing.
5.
