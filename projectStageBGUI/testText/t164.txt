It is a miniature city in itself a collection of warehouses built on thousands of oak piles between 1885 and 1927 in the neo-Gothic brick style.
Narrow streets bridges and canals link together the worlds largest warehouse complex which once provided over 300000 square metres of storage space for all manner of goods at the heart of Hamburgs port.
Reminders of a golden age Merchants didnt just need storage space however they also needed offices.
And so they built the KontorhÃ¤user the first purely administrative buildings in Europe right next to the Speicherstadt.
To this day the KontorhÃ¤user bear witness to the prosperity of the former trading dynasties.
The most famous of them is the Chilehaus which was built using an incredible 4.8 million hand-layered bricks.
Henry B.
Sloman who had made his fortune trading saltpetre from Chile commissioned the architect Fritz HÃ¶ger to design a spectacularly tall building with angled facades to resemble the bow of a ship.
