For more info please see our full disclosure here! Why Stay in a Cabin in Sweden? Sweden is well known for its great outdoors and beautiful nature.
And although forestry is important to Sweden as an industry it is one of the only countries in the world to buck the trend of de-forestation and actually plant more trees every year than it cuts down.
Forests cover 57% of Sweden making getting out into the woods and enjoying them an essential part of any visit to Sweden and how better than by staying in a cabin or house in the middle of nature for some forest bathing or chilling out.
We teamed up with our friends at Nature.house known as Natuurhuisje in their home country of the Netherlands to find out their tips for staying in a cabin and how choosing to stay in a sustainable house in the middle of nature can help the environment too! There are many cabins along Swedenâ€™s beautiful lakes Image c.

Nature.house Why is this concept so important for our life on Earth? Much of the wildlife on Earth is endangered the biodiversity is severely threatened and the at risk numbers are constantly increasing.
If you look at research on the topic of sustainability youâ€™ll discover that planting trees is one of the most effective and efficient ways to stop climate change and is a key part of any solution to protecting the planet.
Nature.house are now working hard to reach their goal of planting 1 million trees by 2021.
The countries where trees are planted are chosen carefully looking at where the new trees have the greatest impact on the ecosystem and climate change.
These are all African countries namely Tanzania Burkina Faso and the 4th biggest island on Earth â€“ Madagascar.
These places where the flora and fauna is threatened will benefit the most because planting trees will ensure the biodiversity is kept alive and even enriched.
This is also where the new trees will have the greatest impact on CO2 reduction.
Another positive outcome is that the initiative supports the local economy by creating jobs for the local population.
This way people can send their children back to school.
The last project of Nature.house is especially connected to protecting the living environments of the birds that migrate to the African continent to find shelter and food.
Why the migrating birds? The founders of Nature.house â€“ Tim & Luuk are two brothers who share a passion for bird watching.
In 2009 Tim & Luuk decided to go to Extremadura Spain for bird watching but they couldnâ€™t find a suitable accommodation outside the packed holiday parks.
In the end they decided to find a way to fill the missing peace in the market and this is how Nature.house was born.
