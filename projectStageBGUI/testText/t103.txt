Latest information on COVID-19 and travel to the UK Experience a real medieval banquet! Tuesday 10 April 2018 Courtiers court jesters and a whole lot of good cheer.
We spent the night at a historic hotel just over 30 minutes south of Birmingham which was once an abbey and then childhood home to â€˜The Winter Queenâ€™ â€“ Elizabeth Stuart of Bohemia â€“ to experience a dinner party 16th-century styleâ€¦ â€˜Huzzah!â€™ We all jeer knocking back our first beaker of mead.
Itâ€™s super sweet much as you might expect alcoholic honey to taste.
My boyfriend Tom and I are at Coombe Abbey a short drive north from both Warwick Castle and Shakespeares birthplace Stratford-upon-Avon for one of their much-lauded medieval banquets which have been running for 40 years.
As a history-geek at heart Iâ€™ve wanted to go to one for ages â€“ itâ€™s a chance to play time traveller.
Iâ€™m not sure what our Tudor ancestors would have made of my costume though.
Iâ€™m dressed as â€˜Knight Lindaâ€™ â€“ in an indigo tunic emblazoned with a red velvet lion and thick black tights wielding a plastic sword.
To top it all off Iâ€™ve got a silver-sequinned handbag a cursory nod to real chainmail.
Tomâ€™s opted for a sinister-looking brown monkâ€™s robe complete with oversized hood and wooden cross.
In the Court of Coombe I notice authenticity is taken to varying degrees of seriousness.
I spot one couple in full Tudor finery a robust Henry VIII in white hose with presumably one of his 6 wives who is gliding around in a bejewelled crimson gown.
Then thereâ€™s a big group of guys in dodgy wigs - one looking ludicrous on a childâ€™s hobby horse.
Another man has got the wrong era entirely and is jovially sporting a Viking horned helmet.
Weâ€™re seated on long benches illuminated by flickering candlelight as they would have been at the abbey back in 1539 when and this eveningâ€™s folly begins.
The Abbot has invited the local peasants â€“ us â€“ for a feast.
Weâ€™re a lively crowd fuelled by a couple of ales in the Hairy Monk Tavern beforehand but we calm down quickly in anticipation of feeding detecting the comforting aroma of a hearty broth wafting in from the kitchen.
The procession of servers cast shadows with their hooded cloaks as they enter the dining hall Gregorian chants echoing in their wake.
Heads down they pour out small bowls of steaming leek and potato pottage which are passed down the rows and eagerly drunk.
Weâ€™re soon introduced to the de Clapper family who announce the year is 1595 and following the dissolution of the monastery they have taken up residence at Coombe Abbey.
Sir Robin delights in informing us weâ€™ve had a status upgrade â€“ we are now his noble guests.
True to the era weâ€™re not given forks for the feast â€“ theyâ€™ve not been invented yet.
So weâ€™re left to tuck in with our hands with just a knife to cut food into manageable chunks.
Itâ€™s intimidating at first but when the pork ribs arrive delivered by a coterie of buxom wenches we find we need no encouragement to get stuck in.
To clean up we just wipe our sticky fingers on the white towelling bibs that have been tied around our necks.
By the time the main course is wheeled out â€“ a quarter roasted fowl â€“ the revelry is well under way.
We link arms with those next to us for a bawdy ballad or 2 led by Sir Robin.
â€˜Huzzah!â€™ Then suddenly the banquet comes to a halt.
â€˜The PLAGUE has come!â€™ cries our host from on stage.
Fortunately a cup-bearer is on hand with more wine to help soften the blow.
Until that is weâ€™re swiftly dealt another blowâ€¦ â€˜We are now at WAR!â€™ declares Sir Robin.
Even his cap woven from cloth of gold is visibly shaken.
He rallies the troops and aided by his brother the drunken Sir Nicholas his mother the dowager Lady Ethel and his niece the flirtatious Frances...
Somehow amid much hi-jinks they manage to save the day.
Eventually partied out we stumble back to our bedchamber.
Our regal-looking room with a sumptuous bed on a raised platform is in the oldest part of the building and overlooks the moat.
Outside snow has begun to fall dusting a certain magic on the scene.
We stick our heads out of the window to admire it.
Ancient trees line the driveway which cuts through the abbeyâ€™s acres of parkland its resident deer cloaked in darkness.
For a moment I can almost picture Sir Robin and his merry band of men on horseback disappearing into the nightâ€¦ Latest Blogs Foodie map of Britain Foodie map of Britain Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Take on Britains best cycling routes Take on Britains best cycling routes Exploring Brent â€“ Londons next Borough of Culture Exploring Brent â€“ Londons next Borough of Culture 48 hours in Leeds 48 hours in Leeds Stay up to date Email Subscribe Find us on Facebook Twitter Instagram OUR WEBSITE Terms of use Sitemap Cookies Privacy Policy General Competition Terms and Conditions Accessibility statement User Generated Content Terms of Use Our other sites CorporateTradeBusiness EventsSelect languageMedia Â© 2020 VisitBritain.
