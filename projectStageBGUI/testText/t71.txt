Along with the ships they buried many items for the afterlife food drink jewellery furniture carriages weapons and even a few dogs for companionship.
Discovered in Oslofjord in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the ships and their wares are beautifully restored offering an evocative emotive insight into Viking life.

The most ostentatious and intimidating of the three is the Oseberg.
The burial chamber beneath it held the largest collection of Viking-age artefacts ever uncovered in Scandinavia though it had been looted of its jewellery.
As daunting as the ship appears it was probably only ever intended as a royal pleasure craft.
The sturdier 24m-long Gokstad built around 890 is the finest remaining example of a Viking longship but when it was unearthed its corresponding burial chamber had also been looted and few artefacts were uncovered.
There is also the third smaller boat the Tune which is fragmentary but what remains is incredibly well preserved.
