The vines run to the foot of the houses built in typical local style and snuggled against each other.
A pretty cocoon from which to admire two towers ruins of the old chateau.
The first at the entrance to the village beside the beautiful Baroque church is topped with a nest.
The storks have good taste because the view is stunning.
Zellenberg External link Mittelbergheim the taste of tradition Â© Laura/Adobe Stock â€” In the streets of Mittelbergheim on the Alsace Wine Route On a hillside near Obernai and Mont Saint Odile Mittelbergheim contrasts sharply with its neighbours.
Here there is no half-timbering but elegant Renaissance houses in pink stone alongside a carefully maintained heritage.
The oil mill and presses tell of a vivid wine tradition as does the â€˜Weinschlagbuhâ€™ a registered manuscript which has chronicled the vineyards and price of wine since 1456.

like all the villages along the Alsace Wine Route Eguisheim a few kilometres from Colmar is bedecked in floral decoration.

And there are wine cellars so welcoming that youâ€™ll willingly stick around.

It tells the story of the holy washerwoman Huna who poured fountain wine at a time when the grapes were failing.
