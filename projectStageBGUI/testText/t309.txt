It’s looked like this every morning of the trip.
I still can’t believe there was only one day of rain the first Sunday here.
This morning looks like each previous morning this trip beautiful sunrise and already getting warm.
At the very empty breakfast buffet for the last bacon and omelette breakfast for awhile.
It will be back to the normal cookies in the car on the drive to work.
Couldn’t online check-in for the flight even though booked through Delta the originating flight from here is on Korean Air.
I’ll need to make sure I leave for the airport a little earlier.
Kind of mixed emotions right now.
I’m anxious to get to the last training and give it everything I have but I’m also ready to get back to the US.
although I’m not exactly excited about the length of the flying.
I won’t be surprised if I sleep the entire 6 hour flight from here to Seoul.
I think that flight leaves at about 10 pm.
Arrival into Savannah is Saturday afternoon.
Can’t wait to get back to the cool temperatures of Georgia! 94 and heat index of 105 sure felt hotter than that this morning.
Got to the gym and once again it was just me and the trainers.
I started the laps today looking forward to finishing the last So true....
Yeah it was hard work and at the moment I can’t even imagine training any harder.
Traveling for 26 hours may affect that opinion.
11 in the Thailand heat.
I was going a little slower trying to notice everything along the path.
The new construction the people doing laundry on the street the taxis and scooters moving people back and forth and the smell of incense along the way.
The heat was hard to ignore and the liniment burn even left after one lap.
After 7 laps the sweat was splashing off me like a sprinkler.
I did my best to avoid people along the way.
I was talkI got to one other guy duding a lap and apparently lost count of mine because at the end Ajahn asked me if I did 12 today.
Makes sense sick the Fitbit 10000 step alarm went off for the first time during the run.
I immediately parked myself near the ice water and under cups of that cold water before I could face the 10 minute jumprope.
Another cool down needed after jumprope and then it was into the ring.
The heat was really tough today but after a shadow boxing warmup we hit the pads.
I hope the video comes out well.
At least the first two rounds were pretty strong.
The heat started taking Jomhod after training From yesterday afternoon Jomhod was doing light training.
This morning he had his weigh-in for the fight on Sunday.
I believe he’s also got a Muay Thai fight scheduled for sometime in November.
its toll along with Ajahns pace in the third and forth round.
We did the normal punches kicks knees and multiple kicks to finish the rounds.
Even Ajahn was sweating today.
It was so hot they even moved a fan over near the ring first time I’d seen that.
Now that I’ve made it back to the hotel and taken a nice long cool shower I need to start packing.
I’ll probably head out for a light lunch and probably a last quick shopping trip I have a couple hours until I head to the airport.
So another trip in the books and back to reality! « Previous Entry Additional photos below Photos 5 Displayed 5 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message pvd78256 pauld78256 Joined October 12th 2017 Trips 2 Last Login November 13th 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 28 Guestbook 13 Photos 78 Forum Posts 0 blog=1043441 blogger=376934 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1043441 blogger=376934 Advertisement Trips Bangkok #6 - Half Dozen !!!

He kept telling me everyday better and better.
I’ve got the bruises and sore everything to prove it.
Sam Sam was one of the other trainers here every day.
I missed seeing Santee and Fahlep this morning.
Sam has been training the couple of other Americans who showed up the last couple of days.
