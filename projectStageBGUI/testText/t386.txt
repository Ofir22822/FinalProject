TEMPLE BOATRUN AND TEMPLE IN THE TREE.
Â« Previous Entry Next Entry Â» Thailand Master Chef Thai Culinary School Advertisement Asia Â» Thailand Â» Central Thailand Â» Ampawa June 22nd 2014 Published June 24th 2014Edit Blog Post Xeaman Temple boat run in Amphawa-36 Young musician After I had some fruit I had a bit of energy to do a boat ride.
There were different prices for the sight seeing boat rides.
50 THB for a regular sight seeing.
It was 500 THB for 5 temples and 900THB for 9 temples.
I didnâ€™t feel like doing any temples at all.
I just wanted to see the temple in the three.
But I could â€˜t ask anyone in English.
I understood you have to go to the more expensive rides to see the temple in the tree.
I wasnâ€™t motivated enough and I decided to go for the basic sightseeing tour.
I took the 50 THB one.
I was surprised to find out that it stops at temples too.
I stepped of the boat at the first 2 but after that I was burned under the sun and stayed on the boat.
Im glad I did because when the boats drop people off they pull off the floating docks and I got some great action watching from there.
I was fascinated watching people order bowls of noodles off a lady on a wooden boat.
This short video is a bit far away but It gives you a Temple boat run in Amphawa-21 mini zoo by the temple in the tree bit of perspective.
I snapped it quickly while I was trying to photograph kids waiting for their food!! To see the video pls click here But I started to think what If I am missing the temple in the tree.
I showed the kids on my boat a photo of the temple on the tree and they said Next stop! Cool so I was going to get to see it after all.
Itâ€™s hard to find and I was lucky the kids took me.
It is crazy busy and difficult to take photos but I did my best.
The highlights were an awl on the three and kids playing traditional instruments.
That was awesome.
I went to leave them money and I noticed that my bills had disappeared.
It wasnâ€™t much 200 THB.
I donâ€™t know how.
I keep my backpack with the zipper towards my body.
But all I had left was change.
I felt bad I couldnâ€™t deposit money in the jar of the young musicians.
They were incredible and I was so burnt by the sun I didnâ€™t think of recording the music.
Bummer.
The boat ride was longer than I expected.
We had Temple boat run in Amphawa-13 Carefully seasoning the noodle soup 15 minutes in each stop at least 4 stops and 40 minutes at the tree with the temple.
There was also minizoo at the stop of the temple in the tree.
There were kids feeding the animals and pretty quickly I forgot about the temple.
I saw the cutest little girl trying to pet the rabbits through the wire net.
After that I was done for the day.
I went back to my papaya salad place and then up to the station where the van towards Bangkok stops.
Once there it started pooring rain.
I got my poncho out.
Im so glad I keep it with me.
It has saved my camera a few times already.
The van from Amphawa to Bangkokg was 80 THB.
I boarded at 330 and arrived at Lumphini MTR at 7pm.
I took 3hrs and 30 minutes to get back.
I was soaked.
My walking shoes were disgusting.
I stoped at the vendors in the corner and order chicken noodle soup that wasnâ€™t that great but it was enogh to warm me up and a beer.
I took a shower and now Im catching up with my typing while Temple boat run in Amphawa-20 Boat captain ...very camera friendly   I download nearly 1000 shots taken over the weekend.

They reach high speeds for them to race each other throwing a huge wake and they are rigged with colorful neon lights! Unreal! Travel Blog Â» Asia Â» Thailand Â» Central Thailand Â» Ampawa Â» Blogs Â» TEMPLE BOATRUN AND TEMPLE IN THE TREE.
