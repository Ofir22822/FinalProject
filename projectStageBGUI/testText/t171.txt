Energy for the mine was supplied by the Upper Harz water management system the worlds foremost pre-industrial water management system for the mining industry.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Producing almost 30 million tonnes of ore the Rammelsberg mines shaped the history and development of the town of Goslar in the Harz region they also led Emperor Heinrich II to establish an imperial palace here.
The first imperial assembly in Goslar took place in 1009 and the town remained a royal seat for German kings and emperors until 1253.
In 1988 after more than 1000 years of virtually non-stop mining the ore extraction was stopped.
Today it lives on in a museum of impressive scale and authenticity.
Not quite so big but just as authentic is Goslars old town whose enchanting skyline is dominated by the mighty Romanesque palace and the towers of no fewer than 47 churches and chapels.
The preserved townscape is dominated by elegant guildhalls reflecting the wealth of the citizens by the historical town hall and by timber-framed houses with ornamental carvings.
In 2010 the World Heritage site was expanded to include Walkenried Abbey the historical Grube Samson mine in St.
Andreasberg and the Upper Harz water management system.
The latter considered a masterpiece of early mining and engineering artistry consists of 107 historical ponds 310 kilometres of ditches and 31 kilometres of waterways.
It is one of the largest pre-industrial power supply facilities in the world.
This part of the World Heritage site can be explored on foot along a network of waterside trails which highlight not only the technological innovations but also the beauty of the landscape.
