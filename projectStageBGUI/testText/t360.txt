Shannons Uncle Bob passed away which was a pretty sad time for everyone.
Even thought we couldnt make it back to say our final goodbyes we were thinking of everyone at this sad sad time.
So love ya Uncle Bob xx Losing Uncle Bob reassured us we are doing the right thing as you never know whats around the corner & you really have to things now not wait for the right time as that right time may never come...or one day itll be to late.
So our first day we were pretty excited waking up to make hot cuppas as the temp was about 1 or maybe minus...well the whole cuppa thing didnt work out to well as all our water taps hoses etc were frozen!!! We rugged up & hired some toboggans & Shan & Maddi hired snow boards.
We were excited as soon as we seen a few snow capped mountains.
We had a great day toboganning building snowmen etc.
The temp was about 7degrees that day.
019 Tobbogan time Maddi did a mad triple flip the first go The next day the boys & I hung out at the van while Maddi & Shan went for a snowboard lesson & a day of snowboarding...which they loved & were extremely good at...but the snow was starting to melt ð?˜? The one thing we really wanted while we were there is for it to snow.
So the next 2 days we did some school work went to the park & rode around just some general quiet time.
The locals were daying yeah snow over the weekend so fingers were crossed they were right.
I woke up early Sunday morning it was cold & sooo windy I think the wind was about 50km/h which when your in a van feels pretty dam windy.
Anyway the caravan park owner came knocking later on & said it was snowing up at Selwynthe snowfields we were heading to YAY we were excited..then we check the local weather on the net and holy crap a Blizzard was forecast....we werent quite sure if this was bad or ok.
SO we got our snow gear on and went for a drive.
The snow started not long after we left WOW it juts got thicker & was the 134 most beautiful thing ive ever seen.
Driving through was scary at times...the snow ploughs hooned around pushing all the snow to the side of the road.
But it was awesome...lakes were frozen trees & hills for as far as you can see white..its was just unreal.
We got out just catching snow & they really fall like the pictures..proper little snow flakes! The boys were eating it off the ground...Deac reckons it was the best day of his life & I reckon he might be right!! Someone did run into a snow plough tho so that wasnt so good.
We headed up again the nest day after they had over half metre of snow built snowmen tobogganing was a lil slower as the snow was so soft...but i have to say I think this might have been an experience of a lifetime..this is why we doing it...loving it!!
