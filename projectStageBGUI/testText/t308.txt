We booked our first hotel here to start from yesterday so we could guarantee that we would have somewhere to sleep as soon as we got there.
We also told the hotel that we would be very late arriving.
We have booked four nights including last night at the Landmark Grand Hotel in Deira.
It looks to be very central and close to the all important Metro station.
We use the Metro a lot to get around.
We got to the hotel about 3.00am and they looked to be having a problem booking us in.
We think they may not have read the message and thought we were not going to arrive.
Eventually they said they could let us have a twin room for that night then move us to the double tomorrow.
With only four nights here we were not particularly happy with that.
Eventually they asked us to wait a short while and they would find us a Junior suite that we could stay in for the whole of our stay.
20190425_123801 Wow an excellent upgrade.
Glad we persisted with this.
While they sorted it out we visited the local supermarket and stocked up on drinks for the room and milk for the coffee in the morning.
The Junior suite was everything that you could want from a hotel room and more.
Very spacious and a big comfortable bed.
We slept till about 10.00am then got up to unpack.
We have someone arriving at 12 midday to collect our washing.
Trying out a local service.
It is a lot cheaper than doing it through the hotel.
He turned up at 11.00am instead but thankfully it was all ready for them by then.
We tidied up the room then thought we would enquire at reception how much it would be for us to have a further 6 nights staying in the Junior suite.
This would save us having to make the two hotel moves that we had planned.
They offered us a really good price steeply discounted by around 1000 AED so we booked it and cancelled our other original bookings.
The discount was secured through our genius marker on www.booking.com.
We were not looking forward to the prospect 20190425_000412 of having to pack up and move twice in any case.
Nice result secured here for us.
Having sorted out the hotel we had a short walk around the local area.
We found the metro station and also the water taxi station.
Realising we were hungry as had not eaten for about 15 hours we had a look on the entertainer app to see what offers there were locally.
We found the Ashiana Indian restaurant in the nearby Sheraton Hotel and had a lovely relaxed first meal lunch in Dubai.
The server gave us a BOGOF voucher for their Saturday evening buffet so we think we shall be returning here.
This has to be done really.
We are both still tired so headed back to the hotel for a short siesta.
This evening we headed to Dubai Festival City.
We had heard they had a great water and light show there.
The area is not near to the metro so it was a long tedious bus ride but it was well worth it.
The light and water show is to a theme and does not only cover the water area but the sides / 20190425_123703 facades of some of the local buildings too.
It was a very unusual show.
Dubai Festival City has one of our favourite restaurants in Dubai Shamiana so we use another entertainer voucher and have a tasty Indian meal for dinner.
We were too tired to do much else whilst we are here so we got a local taxi back to the hotel and called it a night.

We took early retirement at the end of 2010 and intended to spend an extended time travelling.
First we visited our favourite location of Tenerife where we intended on staying for three or four months and possibly buying a property ready for our finally settling down.
We have enjoyed our time here in Tenerife so much we have bought a property and have decided to change our travelling plans.
We still plan to travel the world but will now be doing so over a longer period of time with regular stays in Tenerife in between.
