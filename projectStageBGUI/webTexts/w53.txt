Off-the-Beaten Path Motorbiking Borneo 06/17/2013 by Kristin 17 Comments Days 248-251 Letâ€™s ride a motorbike through Borneo I was thinking to myself this is crazy.
Iâ€™m riding a motorbike through Borneo with two people I met only a few days ago.â€? Neil had a valid point.
We had only met a few days before randomly in a dorm before deciding to climb Mount Kinabalu together in one day.
A few days before that I had met Andrew a guy from Scotland who had told me he planned to motorbike around Sabah the northern state of Malaysian Borneo for a few days.
The three of us ended up meeting up by chance back in Kota Kinabalu Sabahâ€™s largest city and decided to take the trip together.
Things started to go awry before we even took off.
It seemed there was no real need to book a couple bikes ahead of time so we didnâ€™t.
When the morning came that we wanted to get going of course the bikes had been rented out.
A few were getting fixed in the shop and would be back in the afternoon.
We waited.
Finally the bikes arrived and we were off albeit much later than planned â€“ stopping once in search of rope as the bags were slipping out of place on the back of Neilâ€™s bike.
Some friendly locals gave us some and we were on our way again.
The series of unfortunate events All seemed to be going well until an hour out of Kota Kinabalu the back tire of the bike Andrew and I were riding went flat.
Now what? A beautiful however remote place to be stuck Extremely luckily there was a small convenience store a few meters away that happened to have a pump and spanners.
Andrew took the good bike and rode 12km to the closest town in search of a new inner tube for the tire.
Without his wallet.
The shop ownerâ€™s wife sat and had a conversation with me while we waited.
She called me â€˜sisterâ€™ and seemed astonished that I had truly traveled the whole of Southeast Asia solo.
She expressed concern that we were motorbiking all the way through Sabah.
Very dangerousâ€? she warned.
I assured her that we had known that getting into it.
An hour passed and I started to get a bit concerned.
Finally he showed up with a truck following him.
A pair of locals had lent him the money for the tube and followed him all the way back to the bikes.
Another local fixed the tire for us expecting no compensation in return.
I had encountered such friendliness amongst locals all over Malaysia but still we were blown away.
The rain came and went.
The sunset in the sky was brilliant.
The surrounding rice paddies and natural beauty was astounding.
Just as it became dark we found ourselves 30km from the Tip of Borneo â€“ our first stop.
Just as we turned onto the bumpy and rocky back road to the tip the tire popped again.
Neil went ahead with the good bike while Andrew and I stayed behind with the broken one.
He pushed the bike and I carried the helmets.
We knew it would all work out and casually admired the starry sky and spoke about life and travels.
Thirty or so minutes later a pickup truck arrived to save the day er night as it were.
The Tip and the 300km adventure The next day brought me the most beautiful beach I have encountered in Southeast Asia.
I know I know I say that all the time but this beach was simply incredible almost deserted and full of white sand and clear blue water.
Neil and Andrew got to work replacing the tire and I got to work taking pictures because thatâ€™s what I do best in these kinds of situations.
See how helpful I was? Just beyond the trees Ah cloud porn Blue blue blue The rocky tip â€˜Twas THAT blue.
Seriously.
A beautiful cove From there it was time to take on the next 300km of the journey through palm plantations and general nothingness.
The roads were somewhat rough in places but we managed without breaking any limbs.
Which I understand is a good thing given Andrew had heard that if youâ€™re going to crash a motorbike in those remote jungles youâ€™re better off dying than going to a hospital.
The worst was that Neil ran out of gas only a half a kilometer outside of the coastal town of Sandakan where I parted ways with the boys.
They were heading back up to Kota Kinabalu and I would be heading south to dive in Sipadan.
In the end I was thankful for the adventure.
Through flat tires rice paddies beautiful sunsets skies full of stars rainstorms and filthy clothes it was something Iâ€™ll always be glad I did.
Andrew and Neil Iâ€™m left with the same quote running through my head said by none other than Winnie the Pooh As soon as I saw you I knew an adventure was going to happen.â€? Do it Yourself There are two places to rent motorbikes and scooters in Kota Kinabalu Bunibon Backpackers and Gogosabah be advised this is closed on Sundays.
The other option is to rent a car from a stall near the jetty for the best rates.
Be sure to take extra petrol.
We tried to fill empty water bottles at a Shell station and were told â€˜noâ€™ by the attendant.
They didnâ€™t care at the smaller more remote petrol stations however.
We needed to fill 4 1-litre bottles to make it between gas stations.
Bring a rain jacket as you most likely will get rained on.
Bring an adventurous spirit.

Comments Vid | Bruised Passports says 06/17/2013 at 827 am These are such lovely pictures Kristin.
Enough to put a smile on oneâ€™s face on a gloomy Monday afternoon in London ð?™‚ I spent 8 years in Singapore but never got a chance to go to Borneo when it was so close and now sitting in London I have that itch to go there ASAP.
Funny! Someday soon I am sure ð?™‚ Cheers Reply Kristin says 06/24/2013 at 1207 am Thanks! I havenâ€™t been to Singapore yet so I guess youâ€™ve got me beat there! Reply Toni says 06/17/2013 at 903 am Your beach photos are orgasmic and now I want to â€˜ride in your motorcycle footstepsâ€™ ð?™‚ This sounds and looks incredible Kristin!! Reply Kristin says 06/24/2013 at 1231 am Thanks Toni! Reply Hogga says 06/18/2013 at 530 am gorgeous pics! Also I LOVE vine videos! Reply Kristin says 06/24/2013 at 1233 am Iâ€™m addicted to Vine! Reply RyanRoseKnowsTravel says 06/19/2013 at 1117 am Beautiful photos! I need to visit Borneo next time Iâ€™m in Indonesia! Reply Ryan says 06/19/2013 at 1220 pm Wowâ€¦that beach is damn beautiful! Of course all adventure are not without mishaps but itâ€™s awesome you made it through! Iâ€™ve been dying to do a motorbike tour somewhere in SE Asia.
Do you have a motorcycle license btw? And why is that area you were driving through dangerous? Great read Kristin ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 06/24/2013 at 1236 am Haha I doubt any of the backpackers who rent motorbikes in SE Asia actually have licenses back home.
No I had never driven a bike prior to Thailand.
Itâ€™s just dangerous in general to ride the motorbikes but some of the roads were bad and there were no hospitals anywhere nearby in case we crashed.
Glad we didnâ€™t! Reply Megan says 06/21/2013 at 255 pm Iâ€™ve always wanted to do a motorbike adventure! I had lofty intentions of doing it down Laos but got sidetracked with everything else I wanted to do.
I could definitely give it a whirl in Borneoâ€¦but of course with someone skilled at fixing flats and other mishaps.
That sort of thing has never been my strong point -p Reply Andrew says 03/27/2017 at 244 am Had a terrific week touring Laos with my brother and four mates a couple of years ago as part of an organised dirt bike tour with Remoteasia.
Brother broke his leg before leaving the capital of Vientiane and had to go to hospital in Thailand.
The rest of us carried on.
Reply Ira says 06/27/2013 at 1200 am Wow! The pictures were so good! Iâ€™d like to make it there one day! Reply Nazrul says 12/24/2013 at 352 am Hey Kristin May I know the name of that beach & location and which direction you took from KK to get there? Going to KK this Friday as a bestman and looking to ride after the ceremonies.
Thanks a lot.
Reply Kristin says 12/25/2013 at 1041 pm Hey Nazrul the beach is called the tip of Borneo and you want to head in the direction of Kudat.
