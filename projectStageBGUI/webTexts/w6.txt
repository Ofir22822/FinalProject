Hi Amelia.
I love your blog, it's been really helpful for us.
We are currently designing a home in Melbourne on a downward sloping block.
I noted your comments above.
but I was wondering what would you suggest for a split level home where the entrance is on the upper level and we have a lower level that connects to the garden.
We currently placed the open plan living, dining, kitchen on the upper level with a balcony overlooking the garden.
so that it's the same level as the entry door.
We have stairs inside the house to go downstairs where kids bedrooms and rumpus are.
as well as an outdoor stair from the balcony to the garden.
In this case.
would it make sense to keep the open plan living, dining and kitchen on the upper level.
so our guests do not need to go through our bedrooms to go to the main area.
(and it also has a nice view from the upper level).
Thank you...
