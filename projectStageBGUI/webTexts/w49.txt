Numerous types of bat and the kingfisher also enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the national park as do the yellow narcissi that delight nature lovers with their magnificent floral display in the spring.
Visitors can discover a remarkable synthesis of woodland and water and there are plenty of activities and attractions on offer.
