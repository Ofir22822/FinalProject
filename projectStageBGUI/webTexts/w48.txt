Together with the surrounding Harz Mountains Nature Park and Geopark it is one of the most popular areas for walking and skiing in northern Germany.
With sections in both Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony the park offers a mix of ancient legends and rugged scenery and is a popular tourist destination all year round.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner If youre not afraid of witches you might like to explore the fabled forests and mysterious moors on marked footpaths such as the Goethe Trail or the Harz Witches Trail.
Mount Brocken in Saxony-Anhalt is a spectacular sight.
Its 1132m summit is often enveloped in mist and has inspired many tales about witches.
Steam-powered mountain railway You can of course walk up to the summit of Mount Brocken.
But it is much more relaxing to ride the Harz narrow-gauge railway to Germanys highest-altitude train station at the summit.
Pure adrenaline But if that is altogether too sedate for you why not try a completely different activity? Guided mountain bike tours take adventure-hungry bikers up and down the mountains on narrow trails steep slopes and stony tracks.
See rare animals up close The park is a great place to get close to nature and wildlife.
If you have always wanted to see a red deer a black woodpecker or a wildcat you can do so here.
You can also watch the lynxes being fed and attend wildlife watching sessions â€“ an absolute must for animal lovers.
UNESCO World Heritage The cultural highlights of the region are in the medieval towns of Goslar and Quedlinburg.
The Rammelsberg mines the old quarter of Goslar and the Upper Harz water management system and the collegiate church castle and old town of Quedlinburg are UNESCO World Heritage sites.
