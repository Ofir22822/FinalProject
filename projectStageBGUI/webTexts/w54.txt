Whale Watching and Polar Bear Encounters in Canada 08/07/2017 by Kristin 14 Comments Pin me! I felt the kayak rocking beneath me and glanced down.
A playful grinning white face looked back up at me her head cocked to the side as only Belugas and Narwhals can do.
We checked each other out she whistling and me squealing in delight equally curious about the other creature we were seeing.
Oh hi! I went to Churchill in the far north of Manitoba in Canada with the express purpose of seeing Beluga whales.
Each summer between June and August 60000 of them swim into the brackish water of the Hudson Bay where the temperature is slightly warmer and more hospitable for their calfs.
They reminded me of the bottlenose dolphins I grew up seeing off the coast of California playful curious and not the least bit shy.
I always felt a kindred tie to them being as much of a fish myself as a person can be.
In Churchill there are several ways to interact with them both dry and wet.
First we took a zodiac boat out and watching as they get closer and closer swimming under and around the boat.
Things got even more exciting when we climbed into kayaks that afternoon paddling in the calm bay while slowly but surely they came over and started bubbling up around us and even getting close enough to bump my boat.
I kept giggling and squealing which you already know if you watched in my Instagram story from the day.
They got so close! We also snorkeled with them donning dry suits and floating in the frigid water.
I know it was cold but to be honest I hardly even noticed because I was so engaged with what I was seeing below listening to the whistles of the belugas and almost crying with delight while they floated under me looking up and smiling.
The belugas from up above Few animal activities have allowed me to get this close to the wildlife.
There was the standout experience of seeing a Manta ray glide right over my head in Komodo Indonesia and the magic of standing just a few feet away from Gorillas in Uganda and now this rounds out my top three wildlife experiences.
The zodiac boat Thatâ€™s not even all there is up in Churchill though.
Itâ€™s a triple threat with possible polar bear and northern lights sightings as well.
SO CUTE and deadly I visited with Lazy Bear Expeditions which also took us out on a boat up north to see if we could find some bears as well.
Though theyâ€™re much more common in the autumn months unfortunately the belugas are already gone by then and they were my main draw.
By heading up in late July I got to have both.
A mother and baby beluga you know the song! As far as I know Lazy Bear is the only outfit in town with a boat of this size that takes you out to see the bears in the summer.
Otherwise in the fall itâ€™s all about the arctic crawlers in the tundra so this is a unique experience.
We got pretty close I was able to snap this This too The trip also includes other extras like exploration around town to this downed aircraft.
You can climb in and around it which I absolutely loved as did the kids on the trip.
SO RAD You can also kindly ask for a wake up call if the aurora activity is high enough and the skies are clear.
Since Churchill has the possibility of seeing the northern lights 330 days of the year you just might see them even in the summer.
Sadly due to a combo of low activity and clouds I didnâ€™t see them this time but thatâ€™s okay I did in Iceland and Finland and I will again one day Iâ€™m sure of that.
Some caribou on the shore Before visiting Manitoba I had no idea how many cool things there are to see there.
I was shocked that so few of my travel blogging peers had made it up to Churchill considering how incredibly cool it is to see Belugas and how close I was able to get to them.
Manitoba is so underrated.
Go for the animals and stay for the provincial parks and 100000 lakes.
Do it yourself Getting there After a flood wiped out a section of tracks this year now the only way to get up to Churchill is to fly.
Lazy Bear offers a chartered flight as part of their package.
Costs The base rate for the trips with Lazy Bear start at $4000 CAD roughly $3100 USD at the time of this writing which includes the flight accommodation most meals and most activities with a few add-ons.
For solo travelers This isnâ€™t a trip thatâ€™s easy to do independently.
You need someone around who has a gun just to scare off the bears if needed and to be in a group for safety reasons.
The kayaks and the trips are all tied to various lodges so book ahead before traveling to Churchill.

All thoughts on the amazing Beluga encounters are my own.

Reply Pilot Mark says 08/08/2017 at 928 pm Fantastic photos! Sometimes its so worth it to pay a little extra for a tour that really leaves you breathlessâ€¦and gives you an up-close experience with some amazing animals! My up-close-and-personal experience with the swimming pigs in the Bahamas was certainly something IÂ´ll never forget! Reply Kristin says 08/08/2017 at 1103 pm Iâ€™d love to see those guys! Reply Kristin says 08/08/2017 at 1103 pm I wanted to see the Belugas! Reply Danielle says 08/13/2017 at 1123 am What an incredible experience.
We baulked at heading to Churchill during our recent trip to Canada as our budget was getting tight but this post has renewed our interest.
If itâ€™s anywhere near as incredible as mantas and gorillas then weâ€™d be crazy not to put it right at the top of our bucket list.
Better start saving .

thanks for the inspiration! Reply GG says 08/20/2017 at 857 am The video and description of your encounter with the belugas was nothing short of unbelievably cool! Your videos get better each time.
My only experience with belugas are in the aquarium and I worry about them because even if it is the biggest tank in the world it isnâ€™t nearly enough space! To swim with them would be worth the trip to Churchill alone! What a big pull for me.
I am into marine life.
Hope to experience a loggerhead nesting swim with manatees and letâ€™s add belugas to the list! Did not realize Churchill had so much to offer with the museum art work rivaling any big city in the U.S.
with the limited resources too! polar bears and beluga experiences in the same week in addition to scientific research which is what I am into the bay itself the interesting history other wildlife etc.! I am most familiar with Churchill more from the meteorological side with it being a favorite place to mention in weather forecasts about arctic chills coming down to the United States.
Little do they know it can reach 99F 37C well it is the record high in addition to sub -40F and C in the winter.
The big deal up there I think is reaching freezing in January.
It has never happened in recorded history in Churchill.
The record high is 30F and they have kept records for a long time.
I remember they forecasted freezing a few years back and everyone was worrying about climate change but it hit 30F.
If that ever happens it will be a really big deal there.
Something like thunderstorms in Barrow Alaska several years back which is super rare.
It is great how you support these small communities and less known jewels by your site.
It is a great side effect of your work! Hope they get that train back up and running feel bad it is an American company that is sitting on their heels maybe the locals can buy it and fix it! As a point of discussion for all Letâ€™s not let climate change be an excuse to abandon these northern communities in favor of another area.
Sometimes a real big problem can be exploited politically to push another agenda.
You really can be exactly sure what will happen.
Sure the frozen road might last shorter and there might be higher water levels but you can adapt and who knows what will happen exactly there versus elsewhere e.g.
the Yukon! Some things are obvious like coastal city management and adaptation but assuming stronger monsoons in SW U.S.
or SE Asia versus weaker and stronger versus weaker hurricanes/typhoons in the Gulf coast/SE Asia is not so clear! I might revisit this with the next post you made if that is okay with everyone! Reply GG says 08/20/2017 at 859 am Ugh meant really canâ€™t be sure!â€? in the last paragraph! Reply Kristin says 08/21/2017 at 101 am Thanks as always for your insightful comments! I am also hoping that there is a way that the railroad can get fixed and also feel bad itâ€™s a private American company causing the issue.
Reply Izy Berry says 08/20/2017 at 916 am Baby beluga!! Is the water warm is your mama home.
