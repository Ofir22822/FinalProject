Cars 2: the Video game! -- FUUUN!
This game is to me, VERY fun! You get to do multiple things, you can do free races, lessons, and battle races, which have weapons along the way that you can shoot at other racers to get ahead. And you can do up to 4 players in any game! I would suggest renting this game from Redbox or something because it depends on who rents it if they like it or not. I personally really enjoyed it and so did my dad, and sister. If you like any type of racing game, or enjoyed Cars 2 the movie, I would definately try this one!
