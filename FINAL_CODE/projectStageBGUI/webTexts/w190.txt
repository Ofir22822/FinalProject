Hotel's Favorite
Pure luxury
Unlike the magnificent  Waldorf Astoria in NY, you can't just enter and have a look around.   The tall Sikh dressed doormen will prevent you from doing so.  There's a separate entrance for guests, who  use their  beautiful  leather room card to enter.  Check in is very VIPish. Taking you through the  divine hall entrance,  with peoole having high tea and a traditionally dressed harpist, you go to a private room away from the  reception area and you sit down on a very comfy armchair  to a  welcome drink and are then  taken to your room.   There were lots of "wow"s from me, since  walking into the main hall, in fact  right upto  my departure.       We were in room 247, with a balcony facing Palm Court and were lucky enough to have witnessed a wedding photo session just in front.  …

A special stay in the Heart of the City
Our stay at the Hotel was great as always. This special staycation was perfect in every way. The customer service to the high tea and the comfortable bed. Raffles Hotel reminded us why it is as special as it is. Looking forward to returning very soon.

A GEM in Singapore
Luxurious experience with rich heritage at Raffles Singapore. Always love staying in colonial styled hotel like Raffles and completed the "grand slam" of staying all 3 hotels by the Sarkies Brothers (including E&O in Penang and the Strand in Yangon).

Feedback for owners of Raffles Hotel Singapore, in this time of Covid-19, sorely needing-
As a seasoned traveller, my experience of being forced to notice a significant divide between impressive sincerity & atrocious lip service in this hotel is unfortunate. Pillows, bottled water and a chain of events due to grossly amateurish lapses blighting my stay have resulted in unavoidable embarrassing conclusions, whereby I disagree with this luxury hotel billing itself as an icon of Singapore.

In my experience, RHS key problems include…
