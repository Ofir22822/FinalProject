Cars 2 needs a refill
It's the best movie licensed game I've played (it barely escaped the barrel), but compared to others, that doesn't say much. The cars are very unstable and hard to completely control, the weapons are pretty much useless, and Lightning McQueen barely cracks a single "Ka-chow!" in the game, despite the annoying number of times he says it in the movie promos. "Bonus stages" where you have to kill cars lacks good AI, and the product placement alone (movie and game) is an unfamiliar jerk away from the classic theme in the original. I wouldn't fully recommend this game, but for desperate game-night families, it's worth a go.
