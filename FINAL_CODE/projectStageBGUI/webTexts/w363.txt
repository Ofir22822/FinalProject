We have stayed at the Luna often. The convenient location, the gorgeous beach, are all reasons we love this hotel. But something has changed. We have always been upgraded because of our consistent stays. Not this time. The room had a beautiful ocean from view on the 7th floor. Our balcony was very small, only room for 2 persons. It did not have a table. The bathroom was dark and in need of renovating. The door knob was broken. One of the lights were burned out. The dishes were dirty. Obviously put away without washing. No complaint about our sweet maid. The pool was bathtub warm so we did not use it for fear of bacteria. Many units were empty and of course understandably because of the virus scare. However, if the Luna cares about keeping its clientel they have to put some effort in.
