First off let me say that Apex Legends is my favorite game and it is far better than Fortnite both by gameplay and by messages. This game not only has the battle royale mode but a PVE(Playing against AI/the game rather than other players) 
If you are worried about swearing then it is very easy to make it so that random squadmates(you have to play either duos or trios) are muted so they can't talk to your child and that means your child can't hear them swear or hear them at all.
Like I said above you can only play trios or duos(no solos) and that is because the game focuses more on teamwork and it teaches kids that you can't win by doing everything yourself(like you can in Fortnite) but you need to work together and combine your abilities to defeat other squads.
