I'd recommend the trip to Taal/Tagaytay although if you want to visit different attractions including the volcano close-up you would need longer than a day.

Do you like island hopping? I can suggest a day trip not from Manila but from Angeles (Clark).

One other thing to consider is that travelling to/from Manila by road can be very time consuming because of the traffic. Corregidor Island would be best suited for an actual day trip from the suggestions Tommo mentioned as it's the nearest.
