Because we were going to be in Italy we decided to bookend our trip with a day in Venice. Active Adventures picked us up at the Marco Polo Airport and within two and one half hours we were transported to San Cassiano. The juxtaposition of the urban to the pastoral was a shock to the senses.It was not hard to make the transition though. Right away we were immersed in our new surroundings. On the very first day, jet-lagged and reeling we were hiking in the rolling hills of San Cassiano.The first days of the trip used the hotel in San Cassiano as a base of operations. We trekked to Santa Croce through the beautiful countryside to a Refugio that used to be a Monastery. By chance, a choir was giving a concert in the chapel and we were treated to an event that may not have been scheduled, but was one of those special occasions that you have to relish when it happens.The next day we visited the tunnels of Lagazuoi, a monument to the stupidity of war, but an adventure that should not be missed.

The most fun 2 weeks ever4.72 (378) I was fortunate enough to be a member of the March Kiwi trip to New Zealands South Island. Its hard to recount all the wonderful highlights from this vacation as each day brought amazing new sights and experiences as well as too many laughs to mention. In one memorable day we went from a glacier high in the mountains to a beach with endangered dolphins doing flips near the shore. From the Milford Sound waterfall, Abel Tasman boat ride in high seas, beautiful hikes, seeing the milky way under the dark sky at Braemar, to bathroom stops and talking toilets, smashing sandflies, cocktail hours and singing old songs: it was all magical.We were so lucky to have Koru and Rachael as the leaders of our exuberant group. They kept us in line, encouraged us on long hikes, cooked great meals and generally took great care of us. After my wonderful Kauri trip I was not surprised that the Kiwi adventure was also well organized with flexible, patient and knowledgeable guides who also kne

In one memorable day we went from a glacier high in the mountains to a beach with endangered dolphins doing flips near the shore. From the Milford Sound waterfall, Abel Tasman boat ride in high seas, beautiful hikes, seeing the milky way under the dark sky at Braemar, to bathroom stops and talking toilets, smashing sandflies, cocktail hours and singing old songs: it was all magical.We were so lucky to have Koru and Rachael as the leaders of our exuberant group. They kept us in line, encouraged us on long hikes, cooked great meals and generally took great care of us. After my wonderful Kauri trip I was not surprised that the Kiwi adventure was also well organized with flexible, patient and knowledgeable guides who also kne
Because we were going to be in Italy we decided to bookend our trip with a day in Venice. Active Adventures picked us up at the Marco Polo Airport and within two and one half hours we were transported to San Cassiano. The juxtaposition of the urban to the pastoral was a shock to the senses.It was not hard to make the transition though. Right away we were immersed in our new surroundings. On the very first day, jet-lagged and reeling we were hiking in the rolling hills of San Cassiano.The first days of the trip used the hotel in San Cassiano as a base of operations. We trekked to Santa Croce through the beautiful countryside to a Refugio that used to be a Monastery. By chance, a choir was giving a concert in the chapel and we were treated to an event that may not have been scheduled, but was one of those special occasions that you have to relish when it happens.The next day we visited the tunnels of Lagazuoi, a monument to the stupidity of war, but an adventure that should not be missed. Deep in the heart
The most fun 2 weeks ever4.72 (378) I was fortunate enough to be a member of the March Kiwi trip to New Zealands South Island. Its hard to recount all the wonderful highlights from this vacation as each day brought amazing new sights and experiences as well as too many laughs to mention.
