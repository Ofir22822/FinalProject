MMORPGs are some of the biggest and most ambitious games on PC. Across hundreds of games, MMOs rake in 10 billion dollars a year and reach an audience much higher than that. Take World of Warcraft, for example, where players have collectively logged more time in Azeroth than our species has been on this planet—over 6 million years. But at the heart of all these big numbers is a simple ideal: That anyone from anywhere can become anything within the confines of these virtual worlds (and grind out some epic loot in the process).

MMOs have come a long way from the text-based multi-user dungeons they evolved from. To celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you decide which one is actually worth your time—we've rounded up the best MMOs that you can play right now. Whether you want to kick ass as some sort of human-cat hybrid or conquer the galaxy as a ruthless dictator, the MMOs on this list represent the best the genre has to offer. To make things easy, we've also broken this list down into categories that really get at the heart of what makes each of these games exemplary.
