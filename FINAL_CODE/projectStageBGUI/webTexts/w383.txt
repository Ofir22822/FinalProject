This game is suitable for any age as long as they are responsible. Any 10 year old should be able to play this. You should never judge a game by the rating. Just get it, and if it's too violent, delete it. It doesn't suck up money like fortnite. It's also not as addictive, but more fun. You should let your kid get this.
