Fun, exciting, then it whines down very slowly.
Now this game isn't too violent, but you can see cars flipping out of control and machine guns called machine guns and act like machine guns, and ARE machine guns... But still the racing is exciting, fast... But then slows down with the stupid controls. 

I like the mariokart style wiimote tilt control, but to backwards drive you must press down on the D-pad, but you must also hold down for 3-4 seconds until it works...

CONCLUSION:
Before buying this, rent it first, I liked it but still it seemed boring (Maybe due to lack of hub world i loved in cars the game) Another thing is this game also uses internet interactions with the world of cars online, that extends the lasting appeal.
