Thank this was our 4th year staying at Luna Palace! Thoroughly enjoy the location! It couldn’t’t be more perfect! The service from the wait staff as well as the food, is excellent! They are very efficient and friendly! The food at the Eclipse restaurant is great! Wether breakfast, lunch, or dinner....it is great! You can choose to relax under a Palipa on the beach, or simply lounge by the pool! Rooms are equipped with a full size refrigerator, 2 burner stove, microwave, and coffee pot. China and cooking utensils are provided! Each roo gives a western facing view of the ocean, beach, and pool! Pool provides a small, shallow area for small children to play under parental supervision
