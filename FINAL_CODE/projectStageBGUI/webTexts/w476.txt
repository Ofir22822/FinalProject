Great game!
I think this game is great! My husband, son, and I can all play together as a family and have a great time, it's fun for everyone. Yes, there is violence- shooting other cars, knocking them off track, etc. But the cars don't "die", they just lose spots in the race and have to catch back up. If your child can grasp the difference between video game and reality, if you have an open dialogue about violence in your every day lives, and if you thought the Cars 2 movie was appropriate for your kids - go for it!
