Some questionable things, but i an give an explanation
ok so first off, I LOVE THIS GAME, Among us is a game of teamwork and betrayal, it has a cartoony artstyle that is appealing to kids, but here are the stuff you might wanna know,
1. There is an in game chat which allows you to talk to players, if you dont have discord that is, some dangerous info can be passed down, but as innersloth said, "stick to the private lobbies". Also, you can censor the chat's bad words, so dont worry, it all good, just talk to your child about online safety,
2. Among us is a murder mystery game, meaning there is a murderer on board that tries to kill the entire crew, when the imposter attacks, a little bit of blood is shown on the screen, (no splatters, just a tiny bit of blood as an effect) on the crewmate who got killed's view, there is a brutal animation where the imposter stabs, shoots, impales, or simply snaps the players neck, these animations are a little violent but it wont do anything to a child, also, no blood is shown in these animations.
3. You can find dead bodies where the imposter killed the crewmember, if you find these, you will be put into a meeting which uses the ingame chat to talk about who the imposter is, you can also call a meeting if you see the imposter hop into a vent,
4.The game allows you to buy some ingame cosmetics, which are 3.00 dollars each, but you get a whole lot of cosmetics without buying anything, soooooooooooooo yeah your child wont ask for your credit card,
5. i recommend getting among us on steam for your child, as the mobile version (which is free) can contain some very inappropriate ads,


soooooooooooo, did i make a good explanation?
