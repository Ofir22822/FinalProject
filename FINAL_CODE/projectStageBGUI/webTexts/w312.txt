One of the Best Versions of Tetris Yet!Let me just start off by saying that I am a huge Tetris fan. It's such a brilliant game. Tetris 99 takes the well known Tetris format and makes it so much better! This game includes the classic marathon mode, which you can either try to clear 150 lines or 999, but also includes a battle royale mode. Just because it has battle in the name doesn't mean that it's actually violent. It just means that you compete against everyone to become the winner. The battle mode really brings something extra exciting to the game that's never really been done before. Great game, it's a must have!
