House is 80% done and I'm doing the finishes. 
I loved everything about the house. 
I even did some little changes but the only thing I need that needs to be a little bigger is the master bathroom. 
I'm the homeowner and my own contractor. 
I raised the attic space when the framer had framed the first floor on top of master bath, bathroom and library and on top of garages. 
I basically added like 1,500 sf more of the regular sf and house looks exactly the same as it shows on plans.
