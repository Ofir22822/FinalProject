Extreme combat racing follows the movie's main storyline!
Love it! Awesome! If you like the movie, then you'll love the game. Lots of gunfire, explosions and weapons are used. The game's storyline is almost the same as the movie. The game actually takes place after the movie. Some levels in the game don't even have to do with racing. Some have to do with hunting down "bad guys". Some also have to do with surving an attack by collecting "batteries" to keep your "shield" activated. There is also one multiplayer game called "Disruptor." The object of it is to collect "bombs" to place in the opposing team's base, to destroy it. So as you can see, it's not just a racing game. It's a spy game. Kids 10 and up can play. Anyone under 8 might find it either too hard to play, or too violent. The game has simple controls. The Wii version gives a more realistic driving experience by letting you tilt the Wii remote to steer left and right. Therefore, it is a little bit harder to steer. Although, that isn't the only control you can use. You may also use it with the nunchuk or the classic contoller. You can even use the Nintendo Gamecube contoller. If you are looking for a good action racing game, then this is the way to go.
