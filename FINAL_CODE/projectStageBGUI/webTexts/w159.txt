I would prefer Pagsanjan falls,it is one of the most famous in the philippines. It is also popularly known as Cavinti Falls.It lies within the Pagsanjan Gorge National Park which covers an area of 152.4 hectares.It is 2.hr journey from the town og pagsanjan. You can also get to the waterfalls by hiking from Cavinti. Better plan for Pagsanjan falls.
Corregidor is one of my favourite day trips. A must if you are interested in war history.

Lake Taal, Tagaytay, Villa Escudero and Pagsanjan Falls are other great options.
We are dreaming of a post-Covid world where travel is possible again. What day trip would you recommend? Lake Taal, Corregidor, or somewhere else. We will either be at Clark before or after and either enter or exit the country through there.
I'd recommend the trip to Taal/Tagaytay although if you want to visit different attractions including the volcano close-up you would need longer than a day.

Do you like island hopping? I can suggest a day trip not from Manila but from Angeles (Clark).

One other thing to consider is that travelling to/from Manila by road can be very time consuming because of the traffic. Corregidor Island would be best suited for an actual day trip from the suggestions Tommo mentioned as it's the nearest.
