Appropriate Game For Ages 10 and up
No violence at all, this game is good for any age, people 9 or under should not play because of exposure to strangers in the chats. Overall a very great game. Why are parents so overprotective about this game? They think it has a bunch a bullies and "swearing" in the game. Parents, will you stop being Karens? Please do not stop your kids from playing this game. This game is a bit more violent than Minecraft, and what is wrong with swearing? By the way, in the app store, it says 10+ age! There is absolutely no swearing and/or any bullies.
