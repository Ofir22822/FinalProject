Awesome but difficultYou may think you’re good at tetris and so you want to play this game, hoping that you can achieve a victory royale or nearly one fairly easily. Then when you play the game... you’ll have 10 lines of garbage sent to you and it’s game over. Then you’ll be sad. I had a similar experience. I thought I was good but then discovered I’m not that good. I stopped playing for a few weeks then started again and felt like I was having fun. I also felt like I was gradually getting better. I started watching some videos of really good tetris 99 players and learnt a few strats from them. Before this game I didn’t even know what a t spin was. Or a back to back. Or an all clear. I then found out all these cool things. The game has no tutorial so look up about stuff like attacking modes and badges. As I played the game more I got better and better. Now I have about 45 victory royales and I can sometimes pull off t spin doubles (triples are still impossible for me though). I can also do some l and j spins
