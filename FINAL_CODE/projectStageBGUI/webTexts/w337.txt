This game is good and promotes diversity and gives all kids a relatable character
First off let me say that Apex Legends is my favorite game and it is far better than Fortnite both by gameplay and by messages. This game not only has the battle royale mode but a PVE(Playing against AI/the game rather than other players)
If you are worried about swearing then it is very easy to make it so that random squadmates(you have to play either duos or trios) are muted so they can't talk to your child and that means your child can't hear them swear or hear them at all.
Like I said above you can only play trios or duos(no solos) and that is because the game focuses more on teamwork and it teaches kids that you can't win by doing everything yourself(like you can in Fortnite) but you need to work together and combine your abilities to defeat other squads.
Now, you might be thinking that your kid will get really mad when they lose(maybe you have had or heard some fortnite horror stories) but people just seem more relaxed in Apex. I rarely get mad at games but I do see myself in other battle royales feeling a small bit of anger when I lose but in Apex the most mad me and my friends have ever got is saying "Oh dang it we were so close!" And the only time we yell is sometimes you can get caught by surprise and we yell out of fright/surprise.
Now you might be wondering why I said it promotes diversity and that is because it is the first battle royale to have such a diverse background and I will list the diverse cast of the characters(there backgrounds and what they do)

- Bangalore: She is a Black Woman who is a military vet(based off dialogue she was very high ranking) who really does embody the strong independent woman more than any other battle royale character I have ever seen. And I said Loba was the leader but Loba only entered in this season(One new legend/playable character is added each season) (each season is about 2-3 months) and before Loba, Bangalore was the leader of the heroes. Her abilities are very much survival based like when she is getting shot at she runs at double her normal speed and she can shoot a smoke grenade which will make everything cloudy allowing your team to get away she can also send in missiles to provide cover and create a barrier of missiles around where your teams is.

- Wraith: A White Woman who has a goth like personality and her powers involve heading into the void(a place that is in between dimensions) one ablity is called Phase Walk and it makes you nearly invisable and you move faster which is good for scouting for your team or making it into the next eye of the storm/circle. She can also make a portal which can not only go farther than Phase Walk and you can keep going through the same portal over and over again but you can bring your team with you. She also recives warnings from the voices of the void which will warn you when you are spotted or being looked at by another team and that let's you warn your teammates(while you can do this over the mic there are also tons of pings/markers which correspond with dialouge pre-written for your character allowing for you to communicate with your team very well without ever having to talk to them or have them hear you which is good if you don't want your kid talking to strangers)

- Watson: She is a White Woman who is another good smart role model for kids as she is a engineering whiz and according to her bio always pursued her passion for acadmeics and is a genius. Her ablities revolve around electrical traps &amp; tools which can block stuff off(her security bars which are good for making a mini-base in a house for your team and her pylons which will intercept any ordances(grenades, gas traps, ziplines, etc.) and will recharge the sheilds(extra protection/health) of your team but be careful because the tech can't tell friend from foe and will destroy the traps and grenades of your own team so you have to work together to make sure you are not countering each others ablities).

- Reveant: He is a robot/cyborg male who is the bad guy of the story and that shows in his game play as his lines are all evil and he only cares about death(kind of good message to have him be the bad guy) and his ablites are the Death Totem which keep people alive actually and will prevent people from dying when they are downed giving you more time to revive and it can heal while you fight(it goes with the cyborg theme as he is always replacing his body in the story)

- Octane is either a lighter skinned Latino/Hispanic or a tan white skinned man who is supposed to be a speed craver and he sticks himself with this thing that makes him go faster but it makes him take some damage/get hurt. This was meant to make him look like an X-Games player as he takes the risk of getting hurt for all the fun &amp; thrill of going fast or jumping high since his other move is throwing a bouncy pad that launches him high in the air. Some people may mistake the way Octane is portyaed for it to show a Drug Addict but that is not what the devlopers were going for(this is per an interview from them)

Crypto: He is a Philippiano/Asian man who is a tech genius who uses his cyber implats to give him a tactical advantage(sorry this descrpion is so short I just don't play as him much hence I don't have too much info on him)

This game is so teamwork based and that is the awesome thing about it! You have to decide which combo of legends(characters) will work and it shows how everyone is good in some way as every legend is good in different scenarios. For example one of the combos that is really good is Caustic &amp; Watson(along with any third legend) because if you want to play more hiding and holding down a house or bunker or some indoor area then you can use Caustic's gas barrels to block the doors and trap them up and you can also use Watson's gates to do the same things whilst using Watson's plyons to block all grenades, ablities and shots being thrown at you through windows you can use Reveant in that situation because his Death Totem can give you good extra health that is much needed if you are shooting out a window. You could also use Loba because her Black Market let's you pick up healing from the area outside without having to leave the safety(and comprise your position) of your house. Her teleport rings can also let you quickly run out on a quick scouting mission or to get a few blasts in on another team and then quickly teleport back to your house and the same goes for using Wraith's skills that way. You can also use Lifeline to heal people and give extra healing to you within the saftey of your house. But if you want more high paced action with more battles and more running at people then go with people like Bangalore, Wraith, Mirage, Octance, Lifeline, Reveant or Loba because Mirage's decoys help and Bangalore's smoke let's you cause confusion and get into and out of battles quickly same goes for Wraith and Octane's skills and then Reveant is good for damage dealing whilst Loba let's you get loot quick so you can get right to action and Lifeline gives you on the go healing and quicker revives which helps for a high paced/always running type of play.
Some people on these reviews I see complain about the way that the syringes &amp; med kits are bad because they look like drug injectors but actually what they are going for is the futuristic style with you being able to heal yourself super quickly(like the Bacta &amp; Kolto shots that people get in Star Wars or the quick heals given in Star Trek) so they mean to go futuristic not drugs(this also goes for the thing Octane injects to go faster)
I hope this has been helpful to the people who read this(since you just read this monsterly long review a wrote)
