If you missed your chance to snag a PS5 or Xbox Series X at launch this week, you'll have another chance later this month during Black Friday 2020. GameStop recently released its Black Friday ad and is also among a handful of major retailers to confirm that it will have limited stock of the PS5 and Series X and S in stores only on Black Friday (November 27).

GameStop stores will open at 7 AM local time on Black Friday, and all stores will have a minimum of two PS5 and two Xbox Series X consoles at opening, according to the ad. A press release confirms the Series S will be available as well, but the PS5 Digital is not shown or explicitly mentioned, so it's unclear if that system will be widely available. We suggest calling your local store for availability.

Microsoft recently partnered with GameStop to supports its sale of digital systems. The retailer will receive a share of digital revenue earned on systems sold in its stores.

GameStop's move to offer in-store-only console orders on one of the busiest shopping days of the year is in stark contrast with what we've seen at other retailers recently. Sony announced all launch day PS5 orders would be online-only due to safety precautions around the COVID-19 pandemic, and though Best Buy's Black Friday ad also features the PS5 and Xbox Series X, the consoles will be restricted to online purchases only when they're back in stock.

If you do decide to head to your local GameStop on that Friday morning and manage to secure a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you'll have several payment options available. These include traditional layaway, where you reserve the console at the store until you pay it off completely; installment plans that let you pay off your purchase in four installments over six weeks; and rent-to-own, which allows you to take the console home with "minimum upfront money" and pay it off within one to 12 months. You also retain the option to return it at any point.
