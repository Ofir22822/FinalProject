Day trip from Manila

We are dreaming of a post-Covid world where travel is possible again. What day trip would you recommend? Lake Taal, Corregidor, or somewhere else. We will either be at Clark before or after and either enter or exit the country through there.

Corregidor is one of my favourite day trips. A must if you are interested in war history.

Lake Taal, Tagaytay, Villa Escudero and Pagsanjan Falls are other great options.

As we haven’t planned anything yet, the number of days is open. I was thinking one day in Manila and one day trip but could add additional day trips.

I'd recommend the trip to Taal/Tagaytay although if you want to visit different attractions including the volcano close-up you would need longer than a day.

Do you like island hopping? I can suggest a day trip not from Manila but from Angeles (Clark).

One other thing to consider is that travelling to/from Manila by road can be very time consuming because of the traffic. Corregidor Island would be best suited for an actual day trip from the suggestions Tommo mentioned as it's the nearest.

I understand Lake Taal is still off limits ( there was a massive eruption with loss of life in mid January - I got my face masks then ! You can still go to Tagaytay and the views from there are spectacular

My thought from Clark was a day just to show my wife where I was 12 years old but would be open to add a day for a day trip. What did you have in mind? I went to Baguio when I was young.

Pundaquit in Zambales. It'll take about 1.5 hours from Angeles on two buses via Olongapo.

Get off in San Antonio and get a trike to the beach at Pundaquit which is five minutes away. From here you can arrange an island hopping trip to Capones and Camara, and then onto Anawangin Cove which is part of the mainland but inaccessible by land transport.

I would prefer Pagsanjan falls,it is one of the most famous in the philippines. It is also popularly known as Cavinti Falls.It lies within the Pagsanjan Gorge National Park which covers an area of 152.4 hectares.It is 2.hr journey from the town og pagsanjan. You can also get to the waterfalls by hiking from Cavinti. Better plan for Pagsanjan falls.
