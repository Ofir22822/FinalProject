Really good game. 4 character co-op mode is fun. Reminds me of the old TMNT or Gauntlet games. A huge gallery of characters to choose from once you defeat them or reach certain levels. The violence is anything you would see in any superhero fighting game. No blood. Just knocking people over as their life status bar wears down. The main thing I was surprised by is the high usage rate of the word "hell" in the game. In names of places, items, and characters saying "What the hell..." I suppose it's considered a mild swear if at all anymore but it's enough that I don't want my 6 year old hearing it.
