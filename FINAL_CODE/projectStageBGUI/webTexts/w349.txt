When most parents of younger children see 'blood' in a rating they overreact. There is zero gore in Apex Legends. Most games use blood as a warning that you are losing health. It is just a red tint if you will around the edge of your screen. If this helps, you can use knives to stab other players by 'finishing them.' Overall, age does not matter when deciding if your child can play Apex Legends. It is based on maturity. Apex Legends is aimed at teens, so that is what they rated it. Yes, I am just a 14 year kid so if you don't think my opinion is valid then please disregard this review. Hope this helps. Have a nice day!
