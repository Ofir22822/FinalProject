Marvel’s Spider-Man PS4 | Video-Game Review
A Spectacular Game
I loved this game so much, I beat it in a week. Almost to Platinum. A surprising sum of language.
The BEST Video Game Ever Made!!!!
Best PS4 Game I’ve Ever Played
Spider-Man PS4 game for all ages
A spectacular game!
I recomend
Good for 13 year olds
Great Spidey Action
it is a good game without sexual contact
Parents will be relieved that there’s not nearly as much bad stuff in the game as the review says. There is very minimal blood, not much more than scrapes and cuts. The violences involves mostly hand-to-web combat which means less violence. Curse words are also few and far in between, and mostly said by NPCs walking by.
**SPOILERS** Since this is a superhero game, there is violence in most encounters, but nothing that is too much for a teen to handle. Peter, MJ, and Miles are strong characters that always try to do the right thing. Peter goes through personal betrayal (Martin Li becoming Mister Negative, Doctor Octavius becoming Doc Ock) and deaths (Officer Davis, Aunt May). Peter and MJ talk about struggles in their on and off relationship. I think there's one kiss, but nothing more than that. Some cussing, fighting with drug dealers. The controls are a bit difficult at first, but become second nature after playing for a few hours. Compelling storyline, especially the Octavius plot. Overall, an amazing game, can't wait for Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Also, if you are thinking about playing the game, you should know that the challenges can be quite difficult, the MJ and Miles stealth missions aren't very fun, and brutes hit hard. Despite that, the web swinging and combat mechanics are amazing. I haven't played the Batman Arkham games, but I know that the mechanics are very similar. Sorry if this was too long, hope it helps.
Child friendly heroism. If u or ur kid knows drugs r bad this is a good game it has superheros and fun gameplay a good story and is just a good experience. Also open world exciting and feels like ur swinging around NYC in real life.
I have played many Spider-Man based games and this one has to be my favorite. The game is really easy to play if you know the Playstation controls well. The game is as violent as the Spider-Man movies, you can't kill people in the game you only knock them out. The only time you see blood is on people faces rarely, their is use of drugs for cures from what I remember. There is swearing in the game but its not that bad. I highly recommend the game for kids 7 and up, its not that violent of a game and its really fun to play.
I dont care what the age raiting tells the game is amazing get it for your kids for a gift just get it the game is super cool.
I'm probably late, but I was so excited to play this when it came out. I preordered it and as soon as it came out I got up early before school to play it and it was AWESOME. The controls are great. They can be challenging and there are a lot of moves, but once you learn them you truly will "feel like spider man". The story is excellent and the gameplay is exciting. I think practically anyone can love this game. It isn't too inappropriate so you can let you kid play it if you want. Long story short it's worth your time and if you haven't played it yet, you absolutely should.
A good challenge, but with lots of street fighting it could be a bit overwhelming for some kids.
This is an age appropriate game, it has few curse words, it is standalone. Drug references, Spider-Man is against it as in, “nothing puts a pep in my step like halting an illegal drug deal!”. Characters are very likable, you will root for them. In the dlc their are some iffy things like the term booty call, said by Spider-Mans former flame, black cat. He does NOT abide. Fun as main game.
A little bit of violence, swearing, and use of drugs and alcohol,
Spider-Man PS4 is probably my favorite game ever. There is so much to love in this movie! The graphics are astonishing, New York City is very well designed and shown in this game, the characters are likable, the story is brilliant and unique. This could be a perfect Spider-Man movie. I could go on and on. The controls are very responsive and feel very satisfying, especially web-slinging from building to building. Mechanics in this game are really fluid and easy-going, making you not wanna stop being Spider-Man. However, this game is a bit violent and in my opinion is not meant for kids under 13. Spider-Man for PS4 is one of the greatest games on the PS4, quite possibly the best superhero video-game to exist, and one of the greatest games of all time. This game is not to be missed. If you have a PS4, I highly undoubtedly recommend buying this game. It is an undoubtable masterpiece and an amazing game for The Amazing Spider-Man
This was an absolute hit for sure. I had thoughts that this game was going to be bad mainly because of the The Amazing Spider-Man games that were released before this one came out. I could tell much love was put into the gameplay and the soundtrack once I started playing the game. This game's story has no relation to any of the movies and is a stand alone game. Cut all the cutscenes together and you basically get a Spider-Man movie. The voice actors were top notch in this as well. If you want to feel like Spider-Man, you have to pick this up. Like every game, there are still flaws. The stealth missions are quite dull and it feels unnecessary to have them in there. Insomniac could've just skipped over it. I hope they do improve on stealth missions in the sequel if they include them. The side missions aren't really too great either and some of the gameplay can feel a bit tedious to play as well.
I love this game so much. It kept me hooked almost the entire time. It can get a little frustrating, highly recommend if you can play it. Violence: Superhero violence, punching, getting shot shot. A little blood, in spurts, especially if you get shot. Some cutscenes escalate the violence, but there is never any gore. Language: Some use of the S word. Common use of the d word, both at that, and stuff like that. In the background it may sound like there are F bombs being dropped, it in pretty sure there’s not. Sex: Innocent references, and some tight outfits. Consumption:Spidey has to take down drug based and stuff. Extra: Reckless driving and stuff like that.
Over two days, I completed 75% of the game. It hooks you in so much and you can't escape from it's intriguing transe. This game is soooooo easy to play and is cheap depending on where you live and which store you go to. The DLC is no where as good as the main story. MJ and Yuri are amazing female breakout role models in this game to show that women can be heroes and help aswell. I absolutely love how you can unlock different suits and unlock different special abilities with them. The one thing that bothers me a bit is that a lot of the crime alerts are to do with drug dealing before you meet Mr Negative and the Negative Demons. Amazing game!!!! Need to buy!
What makes it great is not just the fact that the action is good, but the storylines are great
This game was a success game because it was so good and better
I recently got a PS4 and the first game I bought was Spider-Man. After playing through the base campaign plus the DLC, I have some thoughts to share. Right from the beginning, Spider-man is fun. The story is original and well written. The open world looks amazing, is fun to explore and is filled with side quests. In certain parts of the game you get to play as other characters from the Spider-Man universe. These sequences offer good stealth mechanics and flesh out the story more. The violence can be brutal, with blood and slow-mo take downs but Spider-Man never actually kills anyone. There are also some disturbing sequences such as a villain possessing someone and making him kill himself, but these scenes aren't common. Spider-Man has many different gadgets to use though I normally just opted for the standard web-shooters. Most baddies have guns or other weapons. There is a bit of language though most is just swearing. I only heard the S word once. The controls took me awhile to get use to (maybe cause I was use to Xbox) but once I did everything was easy to use. There is some drug references and some of the missions have you stopping drug trades. The drugs are portrayed as bags filled with white dust. As for sex in the one DLC the heist there are multiple sex references but nothing bad is ever seen. The whole game is probably as bad as a PG-13 Marvel movie. This is a game I recommend you get, for it is truly spectacular.
It's perfect spider man story with a amazing wep swinging
This game is an AMAZING game, some violence but very little blood, and a side mission that refers to tombstone who is a drug dealer. I've played through twice and the game never gets boring and there is a lot of content, and if I could I could spend hundreds of hours on it.
nooooo
Let your kids play this!
great game but you nead to know your rights from rongs!
Not to bad
Amazing and fun game but unfortunately not much replay value
Great story, movie-esque, but issues with DLC "The City That Never Sleeps"
Best game EVER!
Great game
The most fun game ever!
Amazing
NOTHING BLASPHEMOUS
The coolest game ever!
Great game, not much blood.
Best. Game. Ever!!
GREAT GAME
Realy a great game
Exceeds expectations!
spiderman
Great game for spidey-fans
My gosh it's perfectly appropriate
how can this be for 11 yearolds and people say let your kids play. i have it and oh what does the age rating say again? 16. it has drug use. NOT for KIDS. AT THE VERY LEAST MATURE 15 WITH PARENT WATCHING AT ALL TIMES. IF NOT THEN 16. cus its 16
This game is phenomenal it is perfect for any spider man fan there is no gore the worst thing i heard whilst playing was one swear word other than that I recommend this game
I think that this game is suitable for children age 11 and up because it doesn't have swear words in it and you should be aware that Spider-Man does fight against drugs so your child will have to know that drugs are not ok. Like a lot of Marvel games this one incudes violence, but it is quite tame because there is no blood and gore. There is a very detailed story to it, so if they struggle to focus maybe you should suggest not playing for a huge amount of time in one go. The graphics are amazing and if you want to get a real idea then just watch a video of the game. Other then that it really isn't too bad for a 16.
Well there is cursing but there is a way to DECTIVATE that...... also this gives your child entertainment in a way of swinging a web and saving peoples lives.... aunt may is a great role model . I just think it is a good game and at least is a way better game than other bad games .... For Example... gta 5 or 6 or any other game. Parents I recommend this game .. Thank you for your time
The first time I played this game I loved it! The second time I played it I was kind of bored, this game is extremely fun first time through, it’s got amazing graphics, fun gameplay, a good story, everything a video game needs, except for replay value, yes there are all the little side quests but after three or four of these little things to do around the city it gets tedious and boring. Overall though it’s a fine game, actually I’d say good game, but after playing through it once you might as well trade it into your local GameStop and get something else cause you will be bored, but I would suggest it if you can get it for cheap enough. In terms of maturity level? If you’re okay with letting your kid see a marvel movie or anything PG-13, they’ll be fine with this, there’s some blood but this really gets as bad at most as Avengers Endgame. In the game, Spider-man obviously fights for what’s right and fights against evil which can prove to be a good role model and has a good message. So if you’re interested in this I would pick it up and give it a go.
The story is great, awesome, just like a movie. Violence is okay, also like a MARVEL movie. But the Dlc has some questionable stuff in it, "The Heist", especially. The character Black Cat says questionable things. Also, at the end of the story, there is a kiss between MJ and Peter.
This game makes you feel like spider-man! Mild swearing but that's it! I loved this game! This game was made for marvel fans!
It is a good game with violence but it is not really bloody and gory. It is fine for anyone over the age of 11 or mature kids
This game is the marvel game I’ve been looking for. Very fun combat. Very good story. Some of the missions can get a little boring but usually the boring ones are the quickest ones. Definitely recommended.
Spiderman is an incredibly fun game for both parents and kids. In the game you go around as spiderman defeating bad guys and helping Doctor Octavius with his research. It has a diverse story and even after the story is done you can go around collecting all of the collectibles.
SPIDEY SOLVES CRIME AND IS A GREAT ROlE MODEL FOR KIDS NO BLOOD, VIOLENCE IS ALL FOR A GOOD CAUSE. IF YOU KET YOUR KIDS WATCH MOVIES IN THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE THEN THIS IS NOTHING. THOSE MOVIES LIKE “ENDGAME” ARE TEN TIMES AS VIOLENT AND GOREY.
I like how this game lets you roam around and do mini challenges but the story is cool. Violence: Regular superhero violence with some blood an act of terrorism and that’s really it for violence. Language: S*** a** d*** and h*** some mild drinking and flirting.
This was one of the best video game stories I have ever played. It is pretty long, but it is definitely worth it. There isn't much cursing except mild insults like a-- . It also gets a little emotional towards the end. Overall it was definitely 10/10.
This is one of the best games I have ever played. The story is sometimes intense for younger children, but I think 10 is the perfect age. The game starts out hard, but as you play it gets easier. If you get this game for your kid, especially if they've seen marvel movies, they will love it.
If you're a fan of superheroes and video games then this is a must buy. This is a great game. It is easy to learn the controls and it isn't that explicit. There are infrequent language and violence can get a little graphic at times but it's pretty kid-friendly.
Lots of shooting though you don't use a gun yourself. Spiderman makes jokes sometimes crude. I love this game the only annoyance is that when you die Spiderman repeats dialog from before, but I still think its five stars!
I mean, when if first saw the trailer, it looked amazing. But when I bought this game it exceeded my expectations. It’s has the most complex and well thought out story with beautiful graphics and extremely satisfying and fun combat with excellent and fluent conversations and movements. This game is far beyond the realm of great games. The action can be intense at times, and there is sexual tension between Black Cat and Spider-Man. There are more swears than I thought. Spider-Man is also a good role model by fighting crime and making sacrifices to protect his family, friends and the city. He shows courage and perseverance.Former games and movies have had problems with multiple villains. Like Spider Man 3. But this game covers each and every villain well. Just saying, there are 10 villains in this game plus an infectious disease. You’d think Insomniac couldn’t fit that into here and make it work, but they did it. One problem with Spidey games is the web swinging. I hated the old webs attach to air, but this game makes you feel as vulnerable and powerful as the Web Head by just the sense of how you swing. The webs have to attach the buildings. It’s fun, intense and fairly difficult to learn and play. So parents, make sure to check out this review before you buy. Also it’s quite expensive, and for a good reason.
this game is awesome it has awesome graphics!it has a little violence some cussing time to time little romance and great story!
Excellent game for fans of Spider-Man. The violence is a little intense but nothing that a ten year old couldn’t handle. The swearing is nothing worse than what you would hear while watching a Marvel movie. The game can be hard at some points in time but it is still very simple to figure out. In total, excellent game for those ten and up.
Its really not bad, I mean your a super hero fighting bad guys so yeah its awesome. There is very little blood and has a barely noticeable amount of swearing. But it's one of the best games ever.
