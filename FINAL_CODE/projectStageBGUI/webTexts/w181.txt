Can the whole family enjoy Animal Upon Animal?

Let the stacking begin!
For many years we’ve heard how great Animal Upon Animal is for families. So we’re very happy to finally have a copy, play it, and give it a thorough review.

Sure, it’s a children’s game through and through.
But it’s a dexterity game that’s also fun for adults to play with their children.

First of all, kids inherently love animals. And given the chance to stack blocks or stack animals, we’d bet kids will pick animals every time.

Second, in Animal Upon Animal kids actually have a chance to beat their parents.

Fun stacking sheep!
Most parents will have a better sense of balance when placing animals on top of a growing animal stack. But the roll of the die may make it such that mom or dad has to place something a bit more precarious that will make the pile come crashing down.

If the game were simply taking turns stacking an animal, then parents may win all the time. But the introduction of the random die roll at the start of every turn keeps the possibilities for kids alive.

If they get a lucky roll and get to place 2 animals, they’ll jump out to the lead. And if they roll the hand, then they get to force someone else to place the animal for them (with the change of making the animals fall).
