A great game although the swearing everybody has to go to swearing. even when there kids
Mature, should be rated M
A sensational game that everyone should experience

THE COOLEST SPIDER-MAN GAME OF ALL TIME
Spider-Man is Fantastic and Fine for Most Kids.
A great game!
Best Superhero Game there is
Come on common sense media it's spiderman
Spider-Man At His BEST!!!
Fun game is the best in the Spider-Man game series yet.
Graphics at the top with God of war 2018
This game was great, mild romance and violence and plays out like a great movie with complex characters and a strong story
This game is an action packed adventure, with twists and turns to keep you interested. Well, most of it, at least. Stealth missions are frequent, which slows it to a snail's pace, and even during action sequences, they're as simple as a Telltale game at times.
I’d just like to say this game is AMAZING!! A little violent for kids 9 and under and it does have some cussing. Awesome animation, super fun fight seqences, and it’s pretty funny. Please do play or at least try it out.
This without a doubt is one of the best Spider-Man games you could ever get your hands on. The combat, swinging, and photo mode are just fun and very put together! There is a lot of violence and a bit of cussing, but it’s a superhero game so it’s expected. Spider-Man is a great role model in the game not because he doesnt kill his enemies, but because he takes responsibility as a super hero and does his best to stop crime.
basic Spider-Man gig, bad guys, thwip thwip, Overdramatic sub plot, y'know. But this game really makes you feel like Spider-Man. The swinging physics are out of this world, the graphics are awesome, and the gameplay mechanics are the most patched fluent mechanics in any game I've ever played. This game is legit the only reason I bought a PS4. then my friend bought me a copy of Destiny 2 and we sometimes play it. (see my destiny 2 review, its a terrible game) but I digress, Spider-Man 2018 is really fantastic.
Its literally a spiderman movie but u cant kill anyone.... if you let ur kid watch marvel movie they should be able to play this
I think this game is just fine for nine year olds since it's a superhero game.
The games is really fun. The reason why I think it should be rated M is because there is alot of blood. Another reason is the language. Some words like d--k, ass, damn, hell, s--t, and one f--k.
Spider-Man is a fantastic game. It is combat focused and has some innuendos and minor swear words, but this is something that everyone should experience more than once in their life. It's an amazing story with gripping game play that will leave you just begging for more
This Spider-Man game plays fantastically, and has a few curses. The game is fun for any kid who knows what not to say
Marvel spider-man is one of the BEST games I’ve played in my life. It’s very interesting how Peter Parker must be spider-man and Peter Parker. For example, he’s got to work so he can have a home and he must manage the danger of saving New York City. Although there are some sad parts, Peter can recover and save New York City. Overall, the game is exciting. I would rate this game 4/5.
"Spider-Man" is one of the best stories about the titular character we've ever seen. It contains some action and some slightly darker violence than we've seen in the movies, but it has the same positive messages that are consistently in the big screen adaptations. It's easy to play, a lot of fun and it has a fantastic story, and most kids should be able to play it.
This is a great game. While it does have some violence, it’s nothing a 9 years old can’t handle in my opinion.
I love this game. Most of the people who have played it love it. I have yet to see a legitimate negative rating/review. On the topic of parental advisory, there is almost nothing wrong with this game. I take that back, there is NOTHING mature in this game.
It's spiderman! Why 14+?
Spider-Man is the complete Spider-Man experience. I nails everything why I love Spider-Man. This game with be great for people who read the Spider-Man comics (like me) and for people who don’t know Spider-Man at all!!! The message in this game is a great one. It’s teamwork. Spider-Man has allies like Mary Jane and Miles. All of which have something going on in their lives that is troubling them. They are all great role models for young people. This game is NOT easy to play if you haven’t people the Batman Arkham games and even if you have it’s hard to master the controls. This game has a lot of violence. Punching, kicking, and guns are involved. There is no blood while fight, but there can be a little blood in the aftermath, but nothing serious. During the game someone shoots themselves in the the head, but it does not show it(there is blood).The game has mild swearing like H***, A**, and D***. There is the occasional S***, but you’ll have a hard time hearing it as it is not in cutscenes. You stop drugs deals as Spider-Man, and it shows the drugs packaged. There is a side mission that involves thugs using an inhaler to make their skin though. Overall, this game is fantastic. Teens will LOVE this game as a gift. I highly recommend Marvel’s Spider-Man. And don’t forget the hyphen!!
This is the best, most fun game I've played in a long time. The first boss is challenging but not impossible or frustrating. The combat system is great, and easy to use, and so is the web swinging controls. Goons use guns, crowbars, shields, and fists to fight Spider-Man. Spider-Man can shoot them with webs, punch, kick, or throw them around. Spider-Man can use webs to swing manhole covers, benches, newspaper dispensers, etc. and smash them into enemies. A villain possesses people and control them to get information, etc. In one part of the story, he makes people kill themselves via suicide bombing and gun to the head. He kills survivors to the bombing without mercy. Spider-Man is a walking piece of nostalgia. There are DLCs available. Recommended to Spidey fans or gamers 12+
First off, do not listen to common sense media, there are no uses of the S word I this game. This is a profoundly beautiful game that, date I say it, is worth buying a PS4 to play! This game delivers strong, positive messages and great role models for your children to follow. The violence is only as bad as the violence in your every day 12/pg-13 rated movie, no blood is shown other when you dodge bullets and they hit an enemy in the line of fire. Worth every penny and definitely recommend to all Of the age 12 or over.
Really great game!
Spider-Man
Good game
Very VERY fun game.
Great game, a little violence, nothing to bad
One of the best spider man games
It’s fun for everyone
If kids know how to handle certain things the game is fine.
This game is great. I waited 2 years for it and it is totally worth it. The game is great and even though it might seem complex at first (with the controls) you get used to it. The story is great and easy to follow for little kids, but also very immersive for older kids. Spidey never kills, although a big character dies in the end. Overall was great and I was very sad when I finished the story because it was so good. Peter is also a good role model, always wanting to help people. Only words like 'Da*n and A*s are in the dialogue, and they do say sh*t once, but it is a background character and will be easily ignored by kids. If your kids doesn't really know about these swears it will completely go over there head. And for older kids it wont be that big of a deal. Like I said before, a great game. It also takes a while to beat, and the open world just adds to the story.
Really good game: amazing storyline, graphics etc The rating of 16 is a bit tough as there’s only punching and I’d say if anything it should have the same rating as an actual spider man film. The main storyline is about a new gang after Spider-Man takes down the previous one there is a little gun violence and non graphic scenes showing terroism that is serious however it gives the game stakes. Therefore I would rate the game 8+ but probably I would advise not showing some scenes to young children unless accompanied by an adult Great game and is suitable for younger audiences over the age of 8 with a some level of maturity.
Very good game, although there is a bit of violence it's fine for 10 and up.
This is a very fun game, extremely exciting, great story and brilliant graphics, the controls and combos can be difficult at times, there isn’t much violence, at least compared to other games, some enemies are armed with guns, but that’s about it, if you have a kid with a PS4 this would be a great gift for them for their birthday or Christmas or something
If your a big spider man fan this game is perfect for fun combat good story and the webs stick to buildings, the sinister six is great I'm not gonna tell you the leader though. I'm still getting used to combat and the web slinging but overall fun game.
Very fun game
The best game probably
This game is super fun and its good for most ages
I love this game it’s got swords but please it has no blood so it’s fine. I’ve played this game for over 500 hours and I still find things to do.
Better than 2K
This game is good for a EA Sports game, the gameplay is more fun than 2K, TD Garden and Madison Square Garden is in the game, I enjoy playing this game and is more realistic than 2K.
Amazing
Best Destiny DLC
CSM sucks
SUPER FUN
Good Game. Moderate Swearing and Violence.
Good game for anyone 11 and up
The game is terrific! I've been playing for almost 3 years now (in September) The first game was amazing also, the controls are just like any other FPS and there's a double jump system. The blood in the game is honestly absent in my idea, the only thing I can think of is when you headshot other types of enemies sometimes their life-force, (Vex milk, Fallen ether) will come out but its nothing that you'll be scarred from for sure. The only language that's really bad is, Hell and I think Damn but that's it. The models are very good because you are the chosen one by the Nine to defend the Last City from different alien races such as the Fallen, Vex, Scorn, Hive, the Taken, and the Cabal. The game mechanics are simple, Everything with infusing, power levels, modding your weapons/armor, and classes and subclasses can be really confusing but once you get it all figured out it can be really easy to understand.
This is the best DLC and video game in history. But it is the most frightening and mature one in the Destiny saga. plenty of scary aliens and a beloved character is killed by a bullet to the chest and is left dying and bleeding out in agony in your arms. there is also stronger language in this than the other Destiny games, the strongest word in this game is "Son of a Bitch"
so just going to refute your point about the ethics of revenge in this game. the whole theme is: is revenge right? morally: uldren is being minipulated. is it right to kill him? it isn't because of you are "wasting your time" it's because you run the risk of becoming a hate-twisted monster. the "Thin line" a hand cannon lore entry as evidence: "Thin Line- (legendary Hand cannon) Sometimes you forget which side you're on. Your Ghost makes a list of the things he wishes he could say to you. "Talk to me about how you feel." "I wish we would go home." "You're on a rampage, and I'm not comfortable with it." "I don't think this is why the Traveler chose you." "You know I'll never leave you, right?" "But sometimes… I don't like the look in your eyes." Every day, the list grows longer. "I'm here. I'm still here." "Are you still here?" "I don't want to lose you to this." "I love you." I conclude my case with this statement. why does the ending cutscene end with your ghost begging for uldren's life saying, and I quote: "this isn't the right way" oh wait, I just remembered you don't play the games you review. because your review looks like you read the two sentences in the eververse store and watched the trailers instead of experiencing the story yourselves.
I LOVE this game! there is shooter violence but you don't see much blood. SUPER FUN GAME!
Its really not that bad. The game obviously has issues, but all games have one or two. Content wise, i would say its good for pre-teens and up, maybe 10+ if your kid is a bit mature. The language includes a few uses of damn and hell scattered throughout, and one use of Son of a B--ch in the cut scene after the first mission. the Violence is frequent, however no blood is shown. when you shoot an specific cabal enemy called the legionary in the head and kill it via said method, black goop shoots out of the helmet. this is later clarified in a mission in the EDZ that it is oil used to power their suit, but this could easily be mistaken for blood. otherwise, its just enemies falling to the ground or flying in the air after going boom. the only thing i would watch out for would be online interactions. as almost anyone who has ever talked with a random stranger online for ore than a few minutes, people can be rather vulgar. I feel that anyone under 13 should probably not be using voice chat, but its ultimately up to the parent to judge weather or not your kid is ready. Positive messages/ role models include the fact you are fighting for a noble cause, as well as role models of multiple ethnicities, genders, and races (human, robotic, and alien). Micro transactions are in the game, however these are all cosmetic and are not essential to progress.
I think that Destiny is a game for anyone over the age of 11 because apart from slight violence (shooting and combat) there isn't anything bad. Sure there might be some mild swearing but it isn't as bad as the other games. It's a really fun game and me and my friends all play together in the co-op mode.
