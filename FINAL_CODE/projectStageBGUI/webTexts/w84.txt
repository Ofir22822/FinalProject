You can define styles in a separate CSS file and enable them in the application by using the setStyleClass method.
This method is inherited from the Node class and is available for all UI controls.
Alternatively, you can define the style of a button directly in the code by using the setStyle method.
Example 3-5 and Figure 3-4 demonstrate the latter approach..
