I LOVE this game! there is shooter violence but you don't see much blood. SUPER FUN GAME!
Its really not that bad. The game obviously has issues, but all games have one or two. Content wise, i would say its good for pre-teens and up, maybe 10+ if your kid is a bit mature. The language includes a few uses of damn and hell scattered throughout, and one use of Son of a B--ch in the cut scene after the first mission. the Violence is frequent, however no blood is shown. when you shoot an specific cabal enemy called the legionary in the head and kill it via said method, black goop shoots out of the helmet. this is later clarified in a mission in the EDZ that it is oil used to power their suit, but this could easily be mistaken for blood. otherwise, its just enemies falling to the ground or flying in the air after going boom. the only thing i would watch out for would be online interactions. as almost anyone who has ever talked with a random stranger online for ore than a few minutes, people can be rather vulgar. I feel that anyone under 13 should probably not be using voice chat, but its ultimately up to the parent to judge weather or not your kid is ready. Positive messages/ role models include the fact you are fighting for a noble cause, as well as role models of multiple ethnicities, genders, and races (human, robotic, and alien). Micro transactions are in the game, however these are all cosmetic and are not essential to progress.
I think that Destiny is a game for anyone over the age of 11 because apart from slight violence (shooting and combat) there isn't anything bad. Sure there might be some mild swearing but it isn't as bad as the other games. It's a really fun game and me and my friends all play together in the co-op mode.
