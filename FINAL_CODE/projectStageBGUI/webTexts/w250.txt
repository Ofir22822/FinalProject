Amazing for mature kids!I think that this is a really fun game for kids who will not take any of this to seriously. The only bad things is the gambling and one level with the word "Hell" in it. And if you are a person who takes Catholic or Christian beliefs seriously, I don't recommend this. It involves the devil and there is one level where the main villain shoots out what appears to be the illuminate (Not like the company, sorry for my bad spelling.) But other than that it is a fun problem solving game with cool graphics that parents I think will love. I really recommend this!
