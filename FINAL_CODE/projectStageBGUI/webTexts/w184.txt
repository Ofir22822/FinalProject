I’d like to take the time to send a reflection on my recent purchase of one of your home plans. I have been looking to build a small home for about 5 years. After finding a beautiful property with neighbors who have similar values, I started looking for plans. It took a while to find something that reflects the style I want. Once I narrowed it down, ran it by my builder and got the go ahead to purchase online plans, I made the call. I was greeted by a knowledgeable and professional representative who immediately made me feel at ease. She talked me through all of my questions with kindness and patience. She gave good recommendations based on the information I provided and followed up with an email immediately. She promptly responded to an item I left out, and called the next day to verify she had received the modifications from a designer. When we noticed an error, she immediately started working on correcting it, again following up our conversation with an email. I thought the process would take days or even weeks. By the end of the day, she had contacted the plan architect personally and we were able to complete the purchase with the modifications needed. She was efficient, amiable and a complete pleasure to work with. I’d highly recommend Whitney to anyone calling with trepidation about purchasing online plans.
