I used to be a Fortnite fan, but I switched when this game came out. I really liked it right away, I liked all the characters and the realistic graphics.

Note to parents!
This game is a lot better than Fortnite. The “blood” in this game is only a red hue that appears on the side of the screen when you are injured. Unlike Fortnite the guns in the game aren’t modelled after real guns. Each “legend” in this game have unique abilities that will help your team during the battle royale scenario. I think anyone age 10 and up will play this game and enjoy it. It is a bit challenging but still quite fun. Anyone who buys this game will like it. If you are wondering wether to let your kids play this, maybe try playing the game yourself. I’m sure you and your kids will enjoy it.
