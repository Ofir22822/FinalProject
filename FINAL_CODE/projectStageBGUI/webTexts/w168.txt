If you missed your chance to snag a PS5 or Xbox Series X at launch this week, you'll have another chance later this month during Black Friday 2020. GameStop recently released its Black Friday ad and is also among a handful of major retailers to confirm that it will have limited stock of the PS5 and Series X and S in stores only on Black Friday (November 27).

GameStop stores will open at 7 AM local time on Black Friday, and all stores will have a minimum of two PS5 and two Xbox Series X consoles at opening, according to the ad. A press release confirms the Series S will be available as well, but the PS5 Digital is not shown or explicitly mentioned, so it's unclear if that system will be widely available. We suggest calling your local store for availability.

Microsoft recently partnered with GameStop to supports its sale of digital systems. The retailer will receive a share of digital revenue earned on systems sold in its stores.

GameStop's move to offer in-store-only console orders on one of the busiest shopping days of the year is in stark contrast with what we've seen at other retailers recently. Sony announced all launch day PS5 orders would be online-only due to safety precautions around the COVID-19 pandemic, and though Best Buy's Black Friday ad also features the PS5 and Xbox Series X, the consoles will be restricted to online purchases only when they're back in stock.

If you do decide to head to your local GameStop on that Friday morning and manage to secure a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you'll have several payment options available. These include traditional layaway, where you reserve the console at the store until you pay it off completely; installment plans that let you pay off your purchase in four installments over six weeks; and rent-to-own, which allows you to take the console home with "minimum upfront money" and pay it off within one to 12 months. You also retain the option to return it at any point.

Check out our PS5 buying guide and Xbox Series X buying guide for more info on when and where to find the next-gen consoles in stock during launch week and beyond. Plus, catch up on all the latest Black Friday 2020 news and deals, including GameStop's Black Friday sale and other upcoming sales at Best Buy, Walmart, and Target as the Black Friday countdown continues.

Watch Dogs Legion is barely two weeks old, but you can already grab it for half-off and score the free upgrade to a PS5 or Xbox Series X version to boot. It's available for $30 at Best Buyas part of the retailer's early Black Friday sale.

To see the Watch Dogs Legion deal, though, you'll need to sign up for a My Best Buy account, the free rewards program. At $30, you can choose the PS4 or Xbox One version. Since Ubisoft is offering free upgrades for all of this fall's new releases, you can then upgrade to the PS5 or Xbox Series X version. Since this is a disc version, you'll just need to put in the disc for the upgrade, and then insert the disc anytime you play like you would on the older consoles. Please note this disc version wouldn't work to upgrade on Xbox Series S or the PS5 Digital version.

The game earned an 8/10 in GameSpot's Watch Dogs Legion review. "Watch Dogs: Legion is an anti-fascist game, and it's admirable that it sticks to that message and sees it through to a satisfying and affirming conclusion," wrote editor Alessandro Fillari. "It also bolsters the franchise's clever hacking gameplay to offer more creativity than ever. One of Legion's more profound messages is about what it means to be a true Londoner, and by the game's end, you'll have a DedSec crew made of wildly diverse and disparate citizens from unique cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds--all united in their goal to restore their home. If anything, that's as powerful a message for the game as you can get."

Best Black Friday 2020 Xbox Series X Accessory Deals: Headsets, Controllers, And More
Black Friday 2020 is an excellent time to stock up on Xbox Series X and Xbox One accessories and save a good chunk of change.
By Mat Paget  on November 13, 2020 at 9:11AM PST Comments
There's no better time than Black Friday to save on games, hardware, and accessories, and this year, there are a number of great deals on accessories that work across Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. Whether you're looking for a new Xbox controller, a headset, or even some extra storage for your new console, there are some great upcoming Black Friday deals that will definitely be worth taking advantage of. GameStop, Best Buy, and Target have all listed their Black Friday 2020 ads, and each retailer is discounting a number of different Xbox accessories. We've compiled the best Black Friday Xbox accessory deals announced so far below. Plus, there's a great Black Friday deal on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate if you want to stock up or renew.

With the Xbox One X and All-Digital One S officially discontinued and the Series X/S fresh on the market, don't plan to see many Xbox console deals during Black Friday. Instead, some retailers, including GameStop, are promoting upcoming Black Friday Series X/S restocks. If you're still looking to buy the Xbox Series X/S, we're tracking availability from now through Black Friday.

When will Black Friday Xbox deals be available?
Some retailers have kicked off Black Friday early with a variety of deals, though in most places, we haven't seen many gaming deals available just yet. Each store has a different schedule for when discounts go live, but as usual, we expect Amazon to price-match or even beat the vast majority of them. Before we get into the best Black Friday Xbox One and Series X/S deals, here are the key start dates to know about.

GameStop: Online deals for Xbox games begin November 25 at 9 PM ET / 6 PM PT. You can shop deals in-store starting November 27. GameStop's Black Friday sale ends November 29.
Best Buy: Online deals run from November 22 to November 29. You can head to your local Best Buy store to shop for deals November 27-29.
Walmart: November 25-29
Target: November 22-28
All Xbox wireless controllers
$20 off

Best Buy has the best deal on the Xbox's standard controller. For its Black Friday sale, you can get any Xbox wireless controller for $20 off, including the latest model that released alongside the Xbox Series X and S. Thankfully, that new controller also works on Xbox One and PC.

Razer Wolverine Ultimate controller
$140 (was $160)

If you're looking for an Elite-style controller, the Razer Wolverine Ultimate is one of the best Xbox controllers you can buy. It comes with extra back buttons that you can map functions to as well as RGB lighting and a mute button. It works on Xbox Series X and S as well as Xbox One and PC. GameStop's discounting the Razer Wolverine Ultimate to $140 for Black Friday.

Astro A40 TR wired gaming headset
$120 (was $150)

Astro's A40 TR wired gaming headset is one of the best you can get for Xbox consoles, and thankfully, it even works for the new Xbox Series X and S. It connects via its 3.5mm port to the Xbox controller. If you want a nice, higher-end headset, the Astro A40 TR will be available for $120 during GameStop's Black Friday sale.

See at GameStop
Astro MixAmp Pro TR
$100 (was $130)

The Astro MixAmp Pro TR gives you greater control over the volume and game/voice mix. You connect it to your Xbox console or PC, then plug your Astro headset into it. From there, you're good to chat and play. GameStop will have the MixAmp Pro for only $100 during Black Friday.

Turtle Beach Stealth 300 wired headset
$40 (was $80)

Turtle Beach makes good budget gaming headsets, and its Stealth 300 will be available for only $40 during Target's Black Friday sale. If you're looking for a cheap headset to chat and game with your friends, it's hard to find a cheaper one than this.

See at Target
Seagate 2TB external hard drive
$70 (was $90)

The Xbox Series X and S are backwards compatible with the entire Xbox One library, including all compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox titles. However, you'll need a lot of space to store your games, and keeping your backwards-compatible ones on an external hard drive is the best way to save on space and money. GameStop is selling the great Seagate 2TB external hard drive for only $70 during Black Friday.

Xbox gift cards
10% off

If you're looking for Xbox gift ideas, then a gift card is a great option. It lets your loved one make their own purchases, including digital games and movies. If the person you're buying for owns an Xbox Series S, they won't be able to play any physical games as the system doesn't feature a disc drive. That makes a gift card perfect for them--but of course, you can always buy one for yourself to get Xbox credit at a discount.

NBA 2K21 Black Friday 2020 Deals Slash Its Price To $27 (PS4/Xbox One/Switch)
This year's new basketball sim is more than 50% off less than three months after release.

NBA 2K21 is the latest edition of the annual basketball sim franchise, and as is customary for the series, it'll be seeing some steep discounts on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch for Black Friday 2020. The former two versions are also playable on next-gen hardware, but you should be aware that a pricier, native next-gen edition exists for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S that is not included in the sales we've seen so far.

NBA 2K21
Best deal: $27 at GameStop (available November 25)

NBA 2K21 will be on sale at a variety of retailers for Black Friday, but the best deal of the bunch so far comes from GameStop, where the PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch editions will be discounted to $27 (more than 50% off). If you'd rather shop elsewhere, a number of retailers will sell it for just $28. Either way, this is the cheapest the game has been available for since its release in September.

As noted above, the PS4 and Xbox One versions are backwards-compatible with the PS5 and Xbox Series X, respectively. But with these deals being on physical copies, you'll need a disc drive to take advantage--meaning PS5 Digital edition and Xbox Series S owners will need to hold out for a possible digital deal.

In our NBA 2K21 review, we criticized the game for lacking major new improvements and continuing its frustrating usage of microtransactions, though it does offer some welcome tweaks. "NBA 2K21 shows that the lone basketball sim we have now has largely stagnated. It's a full package, for sure, but one that demonstrates little-to-no motivation to meaningfully improve upon itself," Michael Higham wrote. "That doesn't take away from the strong foundation that makes NBA 2K a fun and rewarding time. However, when you go through the same grind and the same process with only superficial changes, you just get burnt out faster than years prior. If ball is still life, NBA 2K21 is as good a version as any to pick, although even the greatest ballers need a rest."

We'll be updating this post if and when additional deals on NBA 2K21 pop up. Stay tuned for more of our extensive Black Friday coverage, including looks at the best PS4 and PS5 deals, best Xbox One and Series X/S deals, and best Switch deals.

Best Black Friday 2020 Xbox Game Pass Deals
Xbox Game Pass is one of the best game subscription services out there, and Black Friday 2020 will be a great time to stock up for cheap.
By Mat Paget  on November 12, 2020 at 2:38PM PST 1 Comments
Black Friday is always the best time of year for finding gaming deals--if you're looking to save some money before the holidays, it's a cornucopia of discounts you don't want to miss out on. If you own an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One, one of last year's best Black Friday deals is returning. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will see huge discounts during Black Friday at several different retailers, bringing three-month memberships down from $45 to the low $20 range. The service gets users access to the entire Xbox Game Pass library across console and PC in addition to EA Access, Xbox Live Gold, and more.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the best purchase you can make if you're an Xbox gamer, thanks to the large number of games you have access to every month. It's especially great for those with the new Xbox Series X or S consoles, as there are a lot of next-gen games included. If you're a new subscriber, you'll want to snag your first month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $1 first, then stack on extra months with the discounted memberships during Black Friday.

If you're looking for more great Xbox deals, check out Black Friday's best Xbox Series X and Xbox One game deals. You can expect some incredible discounts on brand-new games, including Watch Dogs: Legion and Gears Tactics for half-off. And if you're still looking to buy the Xbox Series X and S, we're tracking availability. The next-gen consoles will be restocked at some retailers during Black Friday.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - 3 months
$20 (was $45)

GameStop has the best deal for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate this year, offering the service for only $20. However, this deal is only available on Black Friday, November 27, so you'll want to mark your calendar and act fast once the deal goes live.

See at GameStop
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - 3 months
$23 (was $45)

Best Buy's Game Pass deal runs from November 22 to November 29, and it's only a few dollars more than the deal from GameStop--though if you buy multiple three-month memberships, it does add up.
