We chose the Luna Palace for a one week stay in November using our RCI and timeshare membership. The medium size and availability with no mandatory all inclusive fees were what attracted us to this hotel located in the Golden Zone in Mazatlan. It is a long walk to the centre or a 20 minute ride with options including a local bus for 11 pesos. The pulmonias (4 seater open vehicles) are fun but the costs can add up if you want to make multiple trips to the city centre. The Luna Palace staff are friendly and helpful. A special thank you to Reuben at the front desk who went out of his way to help us rearrange our departure plans. The hotel is located on the beach with great views and options to stay poolside or be on the beach. The 001 rooms are 1 bedroom units with balconies closest to the ocean. The kitchen area in our unit on an upper floor was just okay. There are pans and items that need replacing. Our plan included dining out and we walked to several highly rated restaurants within minutes of the hotel. The Luna Palace location is 25 minutes from the airport and there are options for shopping both street side and on the beach. The beach vendors are plentiful but move on quickly with a no gracias. Mazatlan with a stay at The Luna Palace is a great vacation plan in my experience.
