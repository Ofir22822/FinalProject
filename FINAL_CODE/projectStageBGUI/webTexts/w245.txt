Amazing game, cultural norms of the 30s.
This game is very fun, although very difficult. 
Studio MDHR takes the beloved 1930s cartoon artstyle and makes a beautiful handcrafted experience that many kids and adults will enjoy. 
It also has a very catchy soundtrack that you will find yourself humming along with. 
The soundtrack is so catchy, there were many songs I knew without even playing the game.
The game, however, is one of the most difficult of it's time. 
The only game I recall being this hard is insane mode Path of Radiance, which was a long 
time ago. It will definitely induce rage, and will take a lot of time and practice to learn.
The only problems with this game, besides the difficulty, is the drug reference. 
The game has some background drinking, gambling, and smoking. In one boss fight, 
there is a background of a club, in which one cartoony character is seen smoking, as well as
 a boss that is a tipsy whiskey bottle. There is also a boss that has a pipe, and a boss that is a slowly burning cigarette.
