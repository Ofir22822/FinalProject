I love this game and it is really great for older kids and teens. I know that some parent don't like blood but its very minimal and there is no gore. The game is heavily based on teamwork but some ply might swear but you can mute them. Also sometimes they might say something like damn but that all. Its easy to play and you can play with friends. And its 100% free but there is microtransactions (thanks a lot EA). You should let you kids play it BUT make sure they don't get you credit card, LOL. I hope this helps you decide.
