Lifestyle joie de vivre or lebensart â€“ whatever you call it Munich has it in spades.
It might be down to the clear blue skies or simply the citys beauty but one things for certain the people of Munich always like to show their best side whether theyre in a beer garden on one of the exclusive shopping streets or in Bayern Munichs stadium.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner A modern cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage as suave as it is easygoing buzzing and yet tranquil.
Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital.
You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich but it doesnt hurt.
Besides these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions.
Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere.
And beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all.
That said undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square â€“ it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls.
The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the HofbrÃ¤uhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around.
Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses.
Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market â€“ from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies.
But take note bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle â€“ so dont be tempted to try least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse Maximilianstrasse Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal.
Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques.
For a far more affordable not to mention more relaxed shopping experience head to Munichs pub and club quarter which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district but also extends around Glockenbachviertel GÃ¤rtnerplatz square and MÃ¼llerstrasse.
The area is as renowned for its party atmosphere as it is for its alternative shops its relaxed atmosphere and its vibrant LGBT scene.
A trip to the English Garden doesnt cost you a penny and Munichs very own piece of paradise situated between the Isar and the city centre is the ultimate chill-out zone.
From lazing around or watching people master the latest craze of slacklining better still have a go yourself to the insane fun of surfing the Eisbach river anything goes in the park.
Add to that two of Munichs most beautiful beer gardens one at the Chinese Pagoda the other at a picturesque lakeside spot and youve got the perfect recipe for a relaxing afternoon.
These are the beer gardens where youll find an eclectic crowd who live life to the full in the shade of ancient chestnut trees.
Thats the Munich way.
The beer gardens came to be called cellars or keller â€“ as in Salvatorkeller LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤ukeller and HofbrÃ¤ukeller â€“ because brewers once kept their beer underground to keep it cool and soon hit upon the idea of selling it from the very same spot.
This was the start of a sacred tradition that as luck would have it is alive and well among locals today.
The people of Munich are also proud of the citys museums many of which are of international standing such as the Deutsches Museum the worlds biggest science and technology museum the Alte Pinakothek the Neue Pinakothek the Pinakothek der Moderne and the Lenbachhaus Museum.
Then theres the Glyptothek Museum the State Collections of Antiques and the Brandhorst Museum with its breathtaking collection of modern art from 1945 onwards.
Here in Munichs Art Quarter however youll also find charming little bars cosy cafÃ©s and pretty boutiques yet another example of how the Munich lifestyle combines culture with the finer things in life.
The BMW Museum has the citys automotive heritage covered while the stars of Bayern Munich show teams visiting the Allianz Arena another side to the citys unique lifestyle what its like to always be on top.
Even if youre not a Bayern Munich fan its still well worth trying to get a ticket to see them play.
The stadium atmosphere alone is world-class and guaranteed to give you goosebumps.
And you wont be surprised to discover that the Allianz Arena is one of the worlds most spectacular stadiums.
It is after all in Munich.
