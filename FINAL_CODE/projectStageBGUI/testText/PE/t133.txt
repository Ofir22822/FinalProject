Dining at the highest level Dinner is a very special affair at restaurant Moon.
High above the city this circular restaurant revolves around its axis in the space of an hour.
Itâ€™s the perfect way to see all of Amsterdam.
And since the restaurant only has window tables you will always have first-class seats.
Please remember to book a table in advance since Moon is a popular restaurant.
Nearby The area north of the IJ in Amsterdam has developed rapidly in recent years.
An increasing number of restaurants and cafÃ©s find a place here and Eye Amsterdam rubs shoulders with Aâ€™DAM Lookout.
If you plan to take the ferry across the IJ why not stroll through the railway station where you will find a modern shopping center in a 19th-century building.
