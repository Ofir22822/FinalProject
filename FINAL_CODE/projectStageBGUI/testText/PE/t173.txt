When the power of art is stronger than a cannon ball The story of the column in Olomouc is an unsettled one.
The stimulus for its construction was one of the most extreme bouts of the plague which hit Moravia at the start of the 18th century.
Although the city already had one plague column at that time the citizens thought it was not spectacular enough.
Once it was finished the Holy Trinity Column immediately became a source of immeasurable pride for the people of Olomouc who already at that time uncovered its unique nature and artistic value.
Their love for this work was so great that when the city was under siege they set out to plead with the Prussian general to tell his soldiers not to shoot at their column.
The liberal general accommodated their wishes and so you can feast your eyes on the original beauty of this place to this very day.
