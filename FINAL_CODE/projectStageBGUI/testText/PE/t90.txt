For our second installment we spoke with Virginia-native Connie Waters about her impromptu decision to move to London the romantic reason she stayed and the cultural differences sheâ€™s noticed as an expatriate.
On relocating After graduating from college during the middle of the financial crisis in 2008 I came across an opportunity to move to London for a year-long internship program through the Mountbatten Institute.
I love traveling and didnt have any real idea of what I wanted to do for a career so I decided to applyâ€”and got it.
During that year I met a great British guy named Ciaran.
After returning back to the U.S.
and dating long-distance for a bit I made the decision to move back to London.
Weâ€™re now married.
On finding the perfect place to live London has so many distinct neighbourhoods.
Its one city but it feels like dozens of little villages all jammed next to each other.
Each part of the city has its own character and sense of community.
We live in Fulham which is a part of west London.
It feels really residential and neighbourhood-y but itâ€™s also walking-distance from plenty of restaurants bars cafes shopping and parksâ€”and is easily accessible to everything in central London.
On housing design London is full of period properties from various eras which have more character than youâ€™ll typically see in many American cities.
Its common to find a single-family home from 100 years ago split into multiple flats.
Itâ€™s also very typical for flats not to have any closet space at all â€“ freestanding wardrobes are needed instead.
While most flats do have a washer/dryer theyâ€™re a lot smaller than the ones youâ€™d find in the U.S.
and theyâ€™re often located in the kitchen.
On using British phrases A lot of British-isms have crept into my vocabulary over the last few yearsâ€”mostly at work.
Now I say lift for elevator diary for calendar and holiday for vacation.
Ive also started saying quite and a bit a lot more often too.
On staying active Londoners walk a lot! It is a very easy city for pedestrians and many people I know even walk to work.
Iâ€™m a big fan of Triyoga which has a few locations around London but I prefer the Chelsea studio.
My colleague recently told me about a group exercise class called Bounce where you jump around on a trampoline.
Apparently itâ€™s really hard! Thereâ€™s also a running path along the Thames in southwest Londonâ€”and lots of races to take part in all year long.
The Royal Parks Half Marathon is a great because it goes through four of the citys royal parks and past lots of famous monuments.
On pub culture In London pubs arenâ€™t just for adults looking for a night out on the town.
Going to a pub for a family lunch is just as acceptable and common as going to a pub for after-work drinks or the big game.
Thereâ€™s also a roundsâ€? etiquette where everyone in the group takes turns buying a round of drinks for the table as opposed to people buying individual drinks for themselves.
One of my favorite things about British pubs is that youâ€™re allowed to take your drink with you outside.
When the weather is nice thereâ€™s always a large crowd of people drinking outdoors.
Plus a lot of the pubs have great beer gardens.
The bars in Broadgate Circle or around Leadenhall Market are always great spots for after-work drinks.
On local cuisine Ive definitely started eating fish and chips more since I moved to London.
And it may sound weird but its the condiments that Ive really gotten into! There are some foods now that I cannot even eat without Brown sauce Colmans mustard or Pizza Express salad dressing.
I love the diversity of Londonâ€™s food scene.
You can find the best food from every country all over the world including Indian Lebanese Spanish and Southeast Asian.
Although the portion sizes are smaller in London than the US if you dont finish your meal its awkward to ask to take home leftover food.
Most restaurants dont do thatâ€”and will look at you strangely for asking! On date nights My husband and I go on a lot of dinner dates because we have a long list of restaurants that we want to try! But we keep coming back to The Sands End in Fulhamâ€”itâ€™s a great gastro pub in our neighborhood with seasonal food and real cask ales.
Theyâ€™re famous for their homemade Scotch eggs and serve them all day long.
On the social nature of tea People dont just drink tea just for an afternoon pick-me-upâ€¦ its more of a social thing here.
Whenever you visit someones home theyll offer you a cup as soon as you walk in the door and at work its an excuse to take 10 minutes out of the day to chat.
While some people like sugar and others dont I dont think Ive ever seen a British person drink a cup of tea without milk.
On must-visit attractions London can be so big and overwhelming especially for first-time visitors.
I recommend going somewhere that offers a view of the entire city just to see how it all pieces together.
Itâ€™s hard to get a feel for where everything is when youâ€™re just traveling around underground! City Social at the top of Tower 42 Sushisamba at the top of Heron Tower Sky Garden and Aqua Shard are all great cocktail bars with awesome cityscape views.
You can also see a beautiful view of the city from Hampstead Heath in north London if youâ€™d rather be outdoors! On new holiday traditions Every November 5th our friends host a big bonfire party to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night.
It feels like the closest thing to a UK Independence Day.
There are fireworks a bonfire and lots of food and drinks.
On regional travel My husband lived in Brighton for many years and still has lots of friends there so Ive been fortunate to visit there many times.
Its a seaside town with a pebble beach and lots of little streets with good cafes and shops.
The Brighton Pavilion is definitely worth checking out too.
I also really like Cambridgeâ€”itâ€™s a beautiful old little city with so much culture.
The Cambridge colleges are interesting to explore â€“ but the must-do attraction is punting up and down the Cam River by yourself or with the help of a guide.
However my all-time favorite UK destination is the Lake District.
Itâ€™s absolutely stunning and a paradise for nature lovers.
On getting away from it all Every once in a while my husband and I like to leave London for a night to explore somewhere new and take break from the city.
Sometimes weâ€™ll visit my husbands family in Wiltshire or as a bit of a splurge and because of the novelty of it! weâ€™ll book a room at one the historic castles and buildings that are abundant across the UK.
Most of them have on-site restaurants and are in the most charming little villages.
Some of our favorite stays have been in Amberley Castle in Sussex Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire and the Manor House in Castle Coombe.
