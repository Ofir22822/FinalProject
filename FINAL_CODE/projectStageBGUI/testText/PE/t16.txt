They can be crunchy or fluffy the question is whether to add yeast or not.
Ingredients for around 40 crunchy or 25 soft bugnes 250g 2 cups multi-purpose flour Â½ packet baking powder 6g 1 tbsp only add for soft bugnes 2 whole eggs 50g 1/4 cup soft butter 75g 1/3 cup sugar 2 pinches salt 2 tbsp rum Icing sugar for dusting Method In a bowl form a well in the flour and baking powder if youâ€™re making fluffy bugnes.
Add the beaten eggs and mix vigorously then add the rest of the ingredients and mix.
Knead the dough well by hand then wrap it in cling film and let it rest for a few hours if this rest exceeds six hours put the dough in the fridge and remove it 10 minutes before using.
If youâ€™re making fluffy bugnes use a large airtight box instead of cling film as the dough will swell a little.
For crunchy bugnes On a floured board using a rolling pin roll out the dough very thinly to 2mm.
Donâ€™t hesitate to use plenty of flour as the dough can be very sticky.
Cut out rectangles of dough roughly 4x8cm with a wheel or pizza cutter.
Make two lines in each rectangle.
For fluffy bugnes On a floured board using a rolling pin roll out the dough to 5-6mm.
Donâ€™t hesitate to add flour as the dough can be very sticky.
Cut fairly narrow diamonds of dough roughly 4x12cm diagonally with a wheel or pizza cutter.
Make one line lengthwise in the centre of each diamond.
Heat some frying oil in a deep pan.
When itâ€™s hot enough test by dropping a small piece of dough into it it should form bubbles and quickly float to the surface brown the bugnes in batches of five depending on the size of your pan for around two minutes turning them over after one.
They should be barely browned for crunchy and golden for fluffy.
Drain them on paper towels.
After allowing them to cool for 15 minutes dust with icing sugar on both sides essential.
Enjoy them lukewarm or cold with tea or coffee.
Both types of bugnes keep for at least a week in an airtight container.
