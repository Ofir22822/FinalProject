Forgotten password? Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Melodious stopover in Salzburg Melodious stopover in Salzburg Salzburg which literally means salt fortressâ€? got its name from its early salt exploitation which also constituted its main wealth.
Located near the German frontier it is the fourth largest Austrian city and is probably one of the most charming places of the country.
Nowadays the city is mostly known as the birthplace of 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart it is also a UNESCO world heritage site since 1997.
On visit in Munich I decided to plan a one-day trip to Salzburg which is enough to discover the main sights and historical monuments the city has to offer.
In this article you will discover what I consider as the highlights of the city complemented with some tips and practical information to make your stay even better.
Accessibility and transportation Because of its central location it is possible to access Salzburg through different ways.
On a national level it is easily accessible by car and train from Vienna.
Within Europe it is well connected to Munich and Zurich especially by rail.
However as a landlocked city with limited parking spaces private vehicular access is discouraged through cheap and simple alternatives.
Salzburg is an eco-friendly city putting a lot of attention on both environmental protection and noise pollution.
In this context the city launched an environmentally friendly bus system made of electric trolleybuses.
The dense network covers numerous stops and buses run every 10 minutes during the daytime.
It is thus simple and easy to access the city from the airport within 4 kilometers from the city-center or from the train station 15-minute walk.
Special tip if you arrive by car I would very much advise to park in one of the Park & Ride P+R parking lots on the outskirts of the city which offer a total of 1100 spaces.
Apart from being practical it is also the cheapest way to get around.
In fact the price 15 EUR includes the parking space and a daily-unlimited bus ticket.
What to do? What to see? Despite the small size of the city it offers countless opportunities whether you are a history buff an architectural amateur or a classical music listener.
In fact as a result of its history and the ones who shaped it Salzburg reveals its multifaceted aspects as you walk through it.
The tour begins with Hohensalzburg Fortress the largest completely preserved castle of Central Europe whose first traces go back to 1077.
It was originally built both to guarantee the safety of the archbishops but also served as barracks and a prison.
Since 1892 it is accessible to the public throughout the year offering numerous opportunities and ticketing options.
From the guided tour with an audio-guide to attending events like the Fortress Concert or simply admiring the stunning 360-degree view on the city and its surroundings it is definitely a must-see in spite of the somewhat high prices.
Accessibility It can be easily accessed by foot or by using the Salzburg Fortress Funicular in Festungsgasse.
Special tip If you plan to visit most of the touristic attractions I warmly recommend to opt for the Salzburg Card available for 24 48 or 72 hours.
After this enriching visit the next stop on the list was Mozartâ€™s birth house known as Mozartâ€™s Geburtshausâ€?.
Salzburgâ€™s Wunderkindâ€? was born there in 1756 and lived there until 1773.
This now world-known museum attracts thousands of tourists from all around the world.
And for a good reason even though one is not a fan of classical music there is no denying that this place makes one shiver.
While wandering through the original rooms where Mozart first saw the day of the light you have the unique opportunity to contemplate valuable artifacts such as historical instruments e.g.
Mozartâ€™s childhood violin mementos and letters written by Mozartâ€™s hand and even more surprising a sample of the virtuosoâ€™s hair.
Special tip In addition to Mozartâ€™s Geburtshaus and if you want to prolong the pleasure you can also visit Mozartâ€™s Wohnhaus known as Tanzmeisterhausâ€? just across the river where he and his family moved in 1773.
You will probably notice that the city is largely marked by a baroque style under the influence of an important Prince Archbishop which it deserves the surname of The Baroque City.
The greatest expression of the baroque nature of Salzburg and an insight into the former archiepiscopal power is undoubtedly the DomQuartier.
This complex of 15.000 square meters consists of palaces cathedrals and an Abbey for which the public access was prohibited for 200 years.
There you will be able to enjoy the stunning Residence State Rooms its gallery the Cathedral Museum and many more.
Special tip If you are not that convinced by the greatness of this place stop at least by the Salzburg Cathedral which is considered as the spiritual center of the city.
Still not impressed? Heading towards the next stop across the river you can simply enjoy the beauty and the charm Salzburgâ€™s streets.
The most famous one remains Getreidegasse.
It is the best-known shopping street but derives its uniqueness and originality from its numerous interior alleys inner courtyards and other curiosities you should discover by yourself! Special tip Lose yourself in one those tiny alleys and try to find this secret treasure shown below.
One hint it is close to Mozartâ€™s Geburtshausâ€¦ After this short break cross one of the bridges and make a last stop at the baroque Mirabell Palace and Garden in the heart of the city.
There you will enjoy the visual orientation towards the DomQuartier and the Fortress offering a last overall historical view of the city before leaving.
There you can recharge your batteries by rambling through The Rose Garden or The Orangery constitutive of this rich array of floral ornamentation typical of baroque gardens.
Where to eat and delicacies You shouldnâ€™t discover Salzburg without tasting one of the main celebrities of the city the Mozartkugel produced since 1884 by FÃ¼rst manufactory? Since then many manufacturers and brands try to imitate the original recipe and mislead unwise visitors.
You donâ€™t want to be one of those? Then you are lucky because here are the four shops where the original Mozartkugeln are sold next to the Mirabell Palace at the old market in the Getreidegasse and at Ritzerboden.
Aside from this famous sugar refinery I recommend the Gasthaus Wilder Mann to all those who want to taste some traditional Austrian cuisine with a good quality-price ratio approximately 10 EUR on average for main course.
Where to find it Getreidegasse 20 5020 Salzburg It is obvious that Salzburg has far more to offer and this article only presents the top-attractions and the must-seeâ€? sights for short-term visitors.
In my perspective the most impressing remains the contrast between the relaxing atmosphere emanating from the streets and the splendor and the grandiosity of the architecture.
This city will thus stay in my mind as a mix of romanticism and power charming and hypnotic all at once!
