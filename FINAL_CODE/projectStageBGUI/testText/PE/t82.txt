Built between 1720 and 1744 and enhanced by the magnificent gardens between 1765 and 1780 it exemplifies a glittering era and is one of the most spectacular royal palaces in Europe.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The WÃ¼rzburg court architect Balthasar Neumann who was given overall responsibility for the enormous construction project had an unenviable role.
He had to keep many sensitive artists happy and motivated to give their best these included the leading architects of Germany and France such as Lucas von Hildebrandt Maximilian von Welsch Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand.
The Italian Antonio Bossi a gifted decorative artist known as the ornamental genius of WÃ¼rzburg Palace and star sculptors such as Johann Wolfgang van der Auvera and Georg Adam Guthmann from Munich were among those who worked on the detailed interior decor.
And Giovanni Battista Tiepolo no less than the greatest fresco painter of the 18th century was responsible for the wall paintings.
They all created timeless works of art in the vestibule staircase While Hall and Imperial Hall â€“ the mirrored hall for example is for many the most perfect example of a room ensemble in the rococo style.
Working in creative collaboration these artists of different nationality and language produced what became known as WÃ¼rzburg rococo the most Italianate of all variations on this style in Germany.
Also part of the UNESCO World Heritage site the court gardens are no less opulent in their beauty than the palace itself.
Another highlight not to be missed in WÃ¼rzburg from the Marienberg Citadel you can enjoy incredible panoramic views across the city and its wonderful surrounding countryside where the famous Franconian wine is produced.
