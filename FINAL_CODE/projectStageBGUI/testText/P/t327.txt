The plan was to do a 2 hour walking tour in Jaffa.
So change of clothes brush of teeth grab an orange and water and out the door I went.
Not too much thoughts were running through my mind other than getting to the meeting point.
And in retrospect that was a good thing.
I will admit to some trepidation of being here alone and wandering the city.
But with cell phone in hand Google maps I just went out the door without any reservations! The walk to Jaffa was about a mile or so but along the coastline.
The Mediterranean Sea is gorgeous! I made it to the meeting point with no time to spare and off we all went on our tour.
This was a free tour and came highly recommemded from all the blogs that I read.
I totally recommend it! The next 2 hours were spent walking the port and the old streets/walk ways of Jaffa.
It was amazing to me to think about all the people who walked this area thousands of years ago.
20180426_104409 Many interesting stories and facts were given...my head is still spinning so you will forgive me if I dont write them all down.
Needless to say unbelievable! Google it! After the tour I came to realize very quickly that I had missed breakfast was was famished.
Off to the St.
George restaurant that I spied on my tour.
They graciously set me up at the bar and I ordered the traditional kabobs.
Not only was the food fantastic it was plentiful! Couldnt finish it all.
And I can say hands down best hummus ever! It was so silky and smooth.
After lunch I then spent the next 3 hours just winding my way around the maze of walkways.
Made my wish on the Wishing Bridge with my hands on my zodiac sign looking out to the Mediterranean! Took many pictures and admired the beautiful views of the sea and Tel Aviv.
You will notice quite a few pictures of doors love those! To just float around and take in the sites is a luxury to say the least.
I had nowhere to be but here and I took advantage! Headed back to my hotel for a quick 20180426_105629 cat nap by the way Tel Aviv has a huge cat population there were cats everywhere! Good thing too since it rained durning that time.
After my nap it was time to find dinner.
I overheard my tour guide saying that Rothschild Blvd was the place to explore so off I went! Spent an hour walking up and down the Blvd before stopping in for dinner.
Glass of wine champagne oyster mushroom rissoto and chocolate mousse for dessert I was set! On my way back to the hotel came upon the urban street art I had been reading about and loved discovering these works on my trek.
Those pictures are in a separate entry you have got to check them out! What a day...still finding it hard to grasp that I am here! It is amazing and I am grateful to be able to experience this.
To experience myself on my own...
Next...Food tour at the Carmel Market and exploring the Flea Market of Jaffa...stay tuned! Be sure to scroll down and look at all the pictures.
I didnt put captions on them.
Maybe when I get back home.
