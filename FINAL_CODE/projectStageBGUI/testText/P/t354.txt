We have been figuring out our next step of this year long adventure.
We have been here for 2.5 weeks now and we are still loving it.
Since the last post we have had many adventures to tell so this may be a long one! The Adventures include <ul style=margin-top 0cm type=disc><li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> Bike rides around Byron Bay<li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> A day figuring out accommodation for 3 months on the Gold Coast<li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> Byron Bay light house walk check out facebook for pictures<li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> lots of beach swims at Clarkes Beach Byron Bay<li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> Visit to Ballina south of Byron Bay<li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> Adventure up to Natural Arch National Park and Springbrook Park this is where we did a couple of hikes swam in a little pool at the bottom where the falls was pouring down.
It was nice ð?˜? <li class=MsoNormal style=colorò‡¨£ margin-top .1pt margin-bottom .1pt mso-para-margin-top .01gd mso-para-margin-bottom .01gd line-height 25.3pt mso-list l0 level1 lfo1 tab-stops list 36.0pt> We tried Stand Up Paddle Boarding.
It was fun we went up and back on the Brunswick River.
Half way we stopped for lunch and then turned around to go back.
Going back was hard as we were going against the wind but we did see lots of blue jelly fish and sting rays ð?˜? We changed our plan from living on the Gold Coast for 3 months as it is similar to Toronto but just with a better beach so we decided to go fruit picking instead.
So the next step was to find a car and drive south towards the fruit picking for the rest of the summer a couple people suggested we go south for the summer and then go north for the winter.
It took us almost a week to find a car but we got a little Nissan.
Once we got the car it was relief - we could head south to finally get jobs ð?˜?.
But before we could do that Scott wanted to pop the question on the beach ð?˜? YAY Before we left Bryon Bay we asked me to marry him which I said yes.
Next we drove down to Sydney.
Stayed the night in a super sketchy Motel Room it wasnt cheap either but it was the only room we could find that late in the evening.
There were stains all over the walls the shower was just part of the floor and it was super awkward.
But it was a bed and I didnt want to sleep in the car.
Then we went to Aubury to stayed with family friends for 2 nights.
It was so nice there was a super pretty lake that we went swimming in and did a couple errands.
Then it is off to the fruit picking farm.
Stay posted to see how the fruit picking goes...
