Ladies Take Back Your Power 10/15/2017 by Kristin 33 Comments Pin me! Iâ€™ve written this post so many times and in so many ways got scared and put it on the back burner again.
The brave women who stepped forward this week to speak out about sexual assault reminded me that by not hiding we stand up for ourselves and for others too.
We say that we wonâ€™t protect our abusers anymore or accept a system that keeps us down by pretending it didnâ€™t happen.
I have something to share too.
There is a deeper stronger reason why Iâ€™m so passionate about women traveling alone.
It healed me.
Part of my story includes sexual abuse as a child.
I still struggle to overcome the lack of trust it instilled in me the steadfast belief that I did not deserve love and that the things that mattered to me would always leave.
It robbed me of normal teenage years if â€˜normalâ€™ is even possible for a teen? and the resulting trauma has ruined every single romantic relationship of mine.
For the longest time I was so afraid to tell you this.
I had shame.
I worried that Iâ€™d invite judgement.
I feared Iâ€™d just look broken like I was complaining or that I was seeking pity.
Now I am realizing that I have to speak out because by staying silent Iâ€™m quietly communicating that itâ€™s okay or that itâ€™s something that I should hide.
So here it is.
Iâ€™m not hiding anymore.
I admit sometimes I feel so angry at my abuser I just think of ways that I can get revenge.
I know enough about SEO at this point to make sure his name and â€˜pedophileâ€™ show up together on Google I could spend hours days months toiling away at this and making sure that I hurt him back.
The court documents are public though the justice system largely failed me as well.
But hate is a poison that only harms me.
And revenge is a sword that cuts me the deepest.
Thatâ€™s not what this blog is for.
My only choices are to rise above or to sink down to depths darker than the inside of a cave â€“ cold wet uncaring and unforgiving.
Then who dies? Then who loses? Stronger now Traveling alone is what showed me that people are good again.
I was scared to do it but it was a gift I finally insisted I had to give myself.
It was an act that many would call selfish.
To those whose families and friends try to guilt or scare them out of going around the world solo Iâ€™m sure you know what I mean when I say that it was selfish.
And you know what? Fine.
I deserved to do it and so do you.
Traveling the world showed me that people including men are not all cruel and abusive.
They are for the most part unbelievably kind and giving.
Every time that something seemed hopeless â€“ I was lost it was the middle of the night I had nowhere to go â€“ someone showed up and helped me.
Every single time.
I thought I had just been lucky so far.
I figured eventually it would run out.
Then my friend Caspar expressed the same thing one Thanksgiving when we all shared what we were thankful for.
He shared that in the eleventh hour there has always been someone there that he is never truly alone.
In that moment all the hair on the back of my neck stood up because I finally knew it wasnâ€™t just dumb luck.
For all of the horrible stories where it didnâ€™t work out which are so few and far between there is such a wealth of kindness and generosity that it doesnâ€™t get attention because it would fill volumes and volumes of newspapers and we would spend all of our time reading because there would be too much good news.
We made it weâ€™ll always make it.
The world is more good than bad.
I know that because I went out to see it.
I know that because I was alone and people took a special interest in caring for me showing me around being good hosts friends and human beings.
They were shepherds because they saw something in me that they liked â€“ the spunk that it took to go it alone the burning need to be healed the last-ditch effort to try to love the world again.
People who have never tried it donâ€™t get it.
They ask arenâ€™t you scared?â€? Isnâ€™t it dangerous?â€? Arenâ€™t you worried that something will happen?â€? Excuse the F bomb but are you fucking kidding me? Worse than what happens in the schools we attend the industry that victimizes women so that they can have a job the dates we go on that end in date rape? The patriarchy telling me that itâ€™s not safe for me to go out and chart my own course? That I would be better off staying at home where people canâ€™t even go to school or the movies or a concert without wondering if theyâ€™ll be next? What the fuck? Seriously what the fuck? You must have no clue what real fear is.
Thatâ€™s what I want to say but I know that they are really asking because theyâ€™re scared too.
We all have something to heal from.
Weâ€™ve all been made victims of this system.
I also cannot emphasize enough that men as a whole are not the problem.
I am not here to demonize them.
I believe that we all have parts of the masculine and feminine in us â€“ do we women not have testosterone running through us too? Men did you not grow inside of a woman? We have to love all of our parts and see humanity as a whole or weâ€™re doomed.
Itâ€™s when we hate something about ourselves so much that we act out and harm others that things go wrong.
No men are not the problem.
The society that created such a sick and twisted power struggle that is the problem.
Thank you to all of the women who have spoken out not just this week but all throughout history.
When we all add up our voices we get louder.
So loud that we canâ€™t be ignored.
Change is happening because weâ€™re not ashamed anymore.
Traveling the world by myself finding out what Iâ€™m made of â€“ that Iâ€™m capable brave enough resourceful enough smart enough and powerful enough healed me in ways I never could have otherwise.
It made me trust again.
So if someone asks you if youâ€™re scared or tells you itâ€™s too dangerous for you just laugh a little bit to yourself.
Theyâ€™re the ones who are scared.
And you are here to show the truth.
That you are strong.
That you will do this.
To anyone who wants to share her story I open up the comments to you as a forum.
Iâ€™m here for you.

Comments Ijana says 10/15/2017 at 819 am Thank you so much for sharing this your writing is just beautiful and Iâ€™m glad you finally decided to use it to express this part of your story â?¤ï¸? You have done so many people a favor with this post by showing that you are a normal person just like them that nobody is alone.
Traveling is a wonderful way to re-open yourself to the idea of trusting people.
Thatâ€™s basically what I did too I was assaulted still hard to use the r word when I was 18 and have gone on to travel and completely restore my faith in people.
I mentioned all the people that you helped with this article but know that you did for sure at least help me ð?™‚ I consider myself quite well adjusted but reading this I felt all warm and fuzzy in knowing the fact that Iâ€™m not the only one.
Keep meeting new awesome people and trusting in the world! ð?˜€ Reply Vianessa says 10/15/2017 at 832 am Thanks for writing this touching and relatable post.
Itâ€™s interesting I rarely think of myself as a solo traveler because I find a community and make friends wherever I go so I never really feel alone except when I choose to be.
Reply Image Earth Travel says 10/15/2017 at 934 am Travelling is an excellent healer.
Reply Emily says 10/15/2017 at 1038 am Thank you so much for this.
Like you said this act of bravery on your part will show so many other women that they arenâ€™t alone.
I worked as a sexual assault nurse at my local ER and every patient I took care of found some way to make it her faultâ€? or some reason that what happened didnâ€™t really countâ€? as assault.
Itâ€™s heartbreaking.
We need to hear each otherâ€™s stories so that we know itâ€™s ok to stand up for ourselves so thank you for sharing yours.
And yes after seeing this crap go on every day in my home city when people tell me I should be afraid to travel â€“ I just laugh and shake my head.
Reply Jessica says 10/15/2017 at 1050 am Thank you for bringing this up and putting yourself in such a vulnerable position.
Iâ€™m sure it wasnâ€™t easy to write this post and I applaude you.
I just got back from a solo trip in Peru today and my family and friends didnâ€™t understand why I had to goâ€?.
I was in a similar situation at the beginning of this year and it really changed me.
I was made to feel powerless and worthless.
I didnâ€™t understand why but traveling made my faith in humanity come back.
I felt so independent and my power came back to me.
Your words were extremely touching and it made me feel so comforted to know Iâ€™m not the only one who feels this way.
Like you said if you havenâ€™t done it you really donâ€™t get it and it can be a lonely feeling.
Thank you again for sharing! Reply Babi Cady says 10/15/2017 at 1108 am Thanks for sharing and for speaking up.
Itâ€™s important for women to know that we are not alone and also the importance of traveling solo.
Traveling solo itâ€™s empowering and I will always support any other woman to go out alone to find out that you are never alone because the world is full of nice people ready to help you! Keep sharing your experiences itâ€™s very important for women empowerment! Reply Amanda Andersen says 10/15/2017 at 1122 am I love this post.
Thank you! Reply Chiara says 10/15/2017 at 1143 am Thank you for bringing this up and sharing your story.
It must be tough but your contribution may be really helpful to other women.
The title â€˜Ladies Take Back Your Powerâ€™ is so powerful.
Reply Charmaine says 10/15/2017 at 1232 pm It is an act of bravery to speak out.
My hat goes off to you.
What you said about travel is so true.
I have traveled by myself 90% of the time and the funny thing is I was never really alone.
Every Christmas I spent away from home I had more things to do than when I am in my home country.
I always get the same questions arent you afraid? To be quite honest the first time i traveled by myself i was afraid but the fear quickly disappeared and was replaced by awe.
For me travel is when I really feel alive.
I have really enjoyed your blog.
Continue being brave and fearless! Reply GG says 10/15/2017 at 204 pm Appreciate the courage you have to share such deep and painful experiences and it is so wonderful how the traveling and this blog has helped so many others as well as provide you healing by being able to express it openly and know that everyone here supports what you are doing.
Hell we hope through this you are replacing shame with pride we are proud of you pity with awe you are awesome fear with power.
We know how you have gone from broken to whole through the traveling solo experience this blog your business writing etc.
I hope to learn from this to help me be whole too.
I also can express how open-heartedâ€? not just minded about not turning blame on a whole group of people or simplifying the problem.
It indeed reflective of the society that condones it not necessarily male vs.
female and really awesome how through your experiences that indeed that in many ways it isnâ€™t masculine vs.
feminine that it really is a spectrum as viewed in many Eastern cultures where we have both.
However the cultures that condoned or even encouraged this behavior have been male run or dominated so we males have to own up to it.
There are so many places in the world where this is an issue.
Men and women need each other while we are not literally equal we need to treat each other as equals and appreciate what each unique person brings to the table.
I agree that most people are generally goodâ€? and will help others in need in a heartbeat.
It is great Kristin that you were able to see this through your experiences.
It is easy to get caught up in the negativity.
Unfortunately forgive me for getting less than positive here it only takes a few to ruin the party so easy to destroy than to build.
These few get all the press! You are correct if you added up all the good deeds people did there would be no room for the bad news even if bad news sells ð?™? although not here!.
I think a lot of the problems regarding abuse and violence is tied to issues of emotional psychological and mental health.
I pray that progress is made in the U.S.
and everywhere that addresses the pain anxiety mental imbalance and depression that affects so many and leads to them to hurt others themselves and loved ones lack empathy and lead to violence and cyber-wars.
There are also those with mental issues who are manipulative yet very charismatic and use religion and nationalism to push his/her agenda and know how to press othersâ€™ buttons to get them to act in ways they wouldnâ€™t otherwise.
Then there are those who feel very lowly of him or herself and if you donâ€™t value your own life then how about anybody else? same goes with those who look to the afterlife too much.
Additional problems involve what happens to people when given the opportunity to have total power over someone else whether in the family unit or in a business military or sports team etc.
Think about what happens when you donâ€™t have control like how one behaves when driving especially in heavy traffic? I think we need for everyone not those who are clinicallyâ€? compromised a mental checkupâ€? is in order especially in a world like today where there is so much going so fast and furious traveling in isolation and letting go are great therapy for this clearly!!!.
I think that would help a lot.
Religion can be of use here too think how it impacted guys like George Foreman and Muhammed Ali  then there is Susan B.
Anthony where Quakers believed in equal rights of men and women.
Lastly we revisit the concept of selfishnessâ€?.
Taking a different angle this go around if you are selfishâ€? where it helps you be a better person and in turn help others like in your case Kristin that is good selfishâ€?.
I think you canâ€™t be good to others if not good to yourself so even when you do something for yourself and it does not hurt anybody else is also goodâ€?.
It is bound to help others in the long run.
I think when others you care for who can do it themselves donâ€™t appreciate what you have done for them and use the selfishâ€? term should look in the mirror.
However you hit on an important point where selfishnessâ€? puts yourself ahead of others.
When one thinks that the purpose in life is to get as much out of it for you before you die and the heck with others or if the strongâ€? and cleverâ€? should flourish and the weakâ€? should not we have a problem and the core to many of the worlds problems beyond the mental health issue.
As human beings and looking at our history the societies that at their time were the most advanced and enduring were the ones where strengthâ€? and clevernessâ€? aligned with working together using mental resources and diversity advancing freedom justice and compassion for the time do note.
We were made with frail bodies provided with strong minds and designed to be social to work together.
However things or people donâ€™t always run as they were designed but we need to remember the original specs.
This is whole topic of selfishnessâ€? is near and dear to me also personally but might get to that at another pointâ€¦.
Reply GG says 10/15/2017 at 932 pm Let me restate part of one of the paragraphs I kind of lost focus on it I canâ€™t possibly fully express how open-heartedâ€? not just minded you are being about not turning blame on a whole group of people or simplifying the problem regarding a culture of abuse.
It is indeed reflective of a society that condones it not simply a male vs.
female problem.
It really is awesome how through your experiences with Eastern cultures/philosophy I am assuming correct me if I am wrong that indeed in many ways it isnâ€™t just all masculine or all feminine that it really is a spectrum where we have at least some level of the other.

Reply Lin says 10/15/2017 at 433 pm Thank you Kristin.
The world needs to hear more of this.
Reply Meera C.
says 10/15/2017 at 442 pm Thank you.
I donâ€™t think I ever considered my past with trauma to be part of my drive to travel.
I havenâ€™t yet reached the point in my life where I get to buy that ticket and go but Iâ€™m working towards it everyday.
I always thought my need to travel was just about me and never really considered traveling alone might help rekindle my trust in people.
When someone changes you on such a fundamental level it can be hard to see the path back to yourself.
But your blog has inspired me to chase my dreams and seek the adventures Iâ€™ve always been searching for.
Thank you for sharing your story.
It really has helped me see a little bit deeper into myself.
You are my hero.
Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1218 am Hi Meera Thanks for your comment.
I know it takes a mountain of courage just to even speak openly about what happened for most of us let alone write it down.
This right here is another huge step forward for you.
Another thing I learned is the importance of taking my time and being gentle with myself.
Youâ€™ll buy that ticket when youâ€™re ready <3 Reply Nikki says 10/15/2017 at 557 pm Kristin!!!! â?¤ï¸?â?¤ï¸?â?¤ï¸? Reply Caspar says 10/15/2017 at 831 pm Wow Kristin I just want to start by congratulating you on deciding to write about this openly.
I cannot imagine what it must be like but itâ€™s clear from the comments that youâ€™ve done enormous good by sharing your experience honestly and fearlessly.
Iâ€™m honoured to have played a minor role in your evolution in thinking about humanity.
It was a beautiful moment to share with you and the others there that night and I reflect on it often.
I canâ€™t wait to cross paths again! Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1224 am I look forward to that as well Caspar! Thanks for noticing this and leaving your thoughts and light <3 Reply SweetBrownReimer says 10/15/2017 at 834 pm Thanks for sharing.
I really enjoy your Insta feed.
Stay strong and enjoy our ?! ?? Reply Nour says 10/15/2017 at 843 pm Thank you for being so brave and sharing your story.
You are so strong and self-aware.
The world needs more people like you â?¤ï¸? Reply Michelle says 10/16/2017 at 226 am You are very brave and I hope that speaking about it means you feel less alone if indeed you do/did and of course that we your readers stand with you in support.
I have not had the same experience as you but travel has healed me in other ways significant to me.
In times of doubting myself my ability my drive my very sense of self it is solo travel that consistently brings me back to my core â€“ who i really am what I can achieve what I like/dislike the every day choices i make away from the constant â€˜noiseâ€™ of other well meaning people.
It gives me the best sense of my own ability competence and self of any therapy around!! Thank you again! â?¤ Reply Lori says 10/16/2017 at 626 am Thanks for sharing Kristin! I was date raped by someone I trusted and looked to.like an older brother.
It put me on a path of abusive relationships and no self worth.
I finally forgave the guy but I still struggle in many areas.
This happened when I was 22 Iâ€™ll be 49 this week.
Itâ€™s a struggle at times but we women have to stop being away of judgment and backlash.
I had people question me say it was my fault etc but no woman deserves to be treated poorly.
We need to teach our sisters daughters etc that we are strong and we can overcome! Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1156 am Thatâ€™s amazing to me that you were able to forgive.
I struggle with that but I will get there one day.
I canâ€™t believe anyone questioned you but tbh the police basically did the same with me and made me feel like I was partially at fault or had been stupid or something.
Can you imagine? A kid! Our society needs to change on this matter.
Iâ€™m sorry you were abused too but glad you are healing.
Reply Sarah says 10/16/2017 at 1015 am Thank you for sharing your story.
I hurt for all of us who have gone through this and I am proud of us for surviving.
One thing i would add is the importance of having a support system as you travel.
Travel can be healing and in my experience I have been helped many many many more times than Iâ€™ve been hurt but thereâ€™s no denying there can be triggering moments on the road.
Just the other day I had to go through a very intense and invasive security check â€“ being forced to remove clothing is massively triggering for a survivor of sexual assault â€“ and Iâ€™m so grateful for a dear friend I could reach out to right after that who knew what i needed to hear youâ€™re safe.â€? Whether itâ€™s friends or a counselor or a support group I think itâ€™s important to know how to access these vital resources as you travel.
Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1157 am Thatâ€™s really good advice Thank you sarah! Reply terra @ terragoes.com says 10/17/2017 at 833 am Thank you so much for sharing! This was spot-on and well-said.
Reply Xenia says 06/05/2018 at 737 am Thanks for sharing this.
You should be proud of yourself and what you have done with your life against all odds.
A round of applause and go on you are a true inspiration for all of us that are trying hard not to be destroyed by the system.
Reply Kristin says 06/06/2018 at 713 am Thank you Xenia.
We can do it together <3 Reply Michelle says 07/13/2018 at 101 pm Hand Wow â€“ thank you for sharing that.
Funny how so many of us who have suffered choose to seek solace in travel and solo travel at that.
I have been bullied â€“ attempted suicide â€“ raped and sexually assaulted â€“ sofa couch surfed having no fixed abode and come out of all it.
At the grand old age of 43 I have a mortgage in London!!!! a cat and a fantastic circle of friend setraline aside Iâ€™ve a one way ticket to Bangkok from Heathrow and a backpack.
My first solo jaunt was to Rome and now Iâ€™m doing a whole continent.
Iâ€™ve been to India and love Yoga so I certainly am a hippy at heart and off to indulge it.
Some women despite what life throws as them canâ€™t be tamed and I guess Iâ€™m one of them! Reply Kristin says 07/13/2018 at 1125 pm Hell yeah Michelle! Way to rise from the ashes like a phoenix! Reply Michelle says 07/13/2018 at 104 pm PS my cat will be fine â€“ I have house sitters for the duration of my trip.
