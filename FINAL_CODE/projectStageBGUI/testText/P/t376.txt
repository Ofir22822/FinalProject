Â« Previous Entry Next Entry Â» Advertisement Asia Â» Japan Â» Aichi Â» Nisshin July 9th 2006 Published July 11th 2006Edit Blog Post Iminimelanimo Fireworks for a 4th of July in Japan Hush! At the moment Im writing this theres around 5 to 7 days left for most of the people in I-House.
For my part I know Im leaving here on Sunday and then go to Tokyo for a week but leaving here feels like Im leaving Japan like all the other ones.
Like if a kind of bound was linking us all...
I know Ill have a great time in Tokyo but still I spent all the summer here with the same persons everyday shared everything with them washed my clothes with them this last one is a joke eh.
Last week I sent my box! Yeah feels like everybody is moving sending boxes of what they got sonce they arrive here and doesnt fit in their bag.
Its so expensive!!! For example mine was not too expensive 80$! wouhou! I guess this is a expense you have to expect when you spend six months in a country and buy lots of clothes and gifts.
One girl here spent nearly 1000$ to send the mangas she bought here for 1$ each...
I think its a bit extreme but oh well theyre lot more expensive where she from.
My Watermelon party! play is going along pretty well its gonna be on the 13th of July in two days! We were supposed to do it last week on Friday but two days before two of the group came to me and asked if it was possible to change the day...
it was pretty impossible for everybody to do it on the due date! Its crazy how the cultural programm student are busy right now all the papers are due the same week...
and plus everybody was kind of sick...
so finally the whole group was really happy to do it this week! Now we now our text last week we didnt...
aye aye aye it could have been bad! and were more relaxed about it even if we still have 10000 things to do! Its great fun and I love it.
It would have been the most interesting I did here appart from learning Japanese obviously! The 4th of July was the Independance day.
Americans decided it was a good reason to light fireworks at 10h30 what was really fun until all the residents in the neighboring called the police its allright they came often in the past and the school Clifton the melon demon the day after thats less good now we have interdiction to light fireworks forever  I didnt do it for America having no nationalist feelings for it but I can say Im a little bit jealous of them they were able to do something by themselves and now looks like it works pretty well! I did it because fireworks are prrrrrretty.
ð?˜‰ Last Friday was the I-House farewell party.
Were gonna have one for the whole programm including Proxy and school staff next Friday.
It was a pretty nice party free food a big fest of watermelon.
It was really cool to see everybody around the three eating their big watermelons while spitting the seeds in the weeds.
There were lots of ice cream too cookies and cream flavor included.
mioum mioum.
Then some of us went to karaoke it was pretty fun we sang for 4 hours some even stayed longer.
Ill miss karaoke.
But you know what? I was looking on the web and I found one in Montreal thats not a bar where there are 40 people you dont that look at you singing like a wanabee popstar.
Ill have to bring you there.
Sunday Yeong Kyoung Hung me and Aya I went to Italian Mura with Hung and his two sempai.
It was pretty nice.
Its a relatively small place but theres a lot of smelling sooooo good pizza restaurants pastas et tout le tralala.
Between other things we went on a little ferry tour and a horse car tour...
the driver was the first gaijin I could talk during the day I was happy to have the possibility to talk with someone because Hung and his sempai are not English speakers...
but that guy was soooo not nice.
I asked him a regular question about his horses...
and he just nod his head with a look saying listen I dont fucking care about what you could tell me...
anyway theres people like that I guess...
but most of the time the horse riders have to be talkative and entertaining...
not in Japan I guess! Well write to you later dont know when...
I leave on Sunday for Tokyo going to take a break in the mountains and come back to Tokyo after.
