Pattaya - Scummy little city! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Jomtien February 29th 2012 Published February 29th 2012Edit Blog Post Michael and Katie our room Hiya!! So after leaving Bangkok we went to Pattaya which is the HOLE!!! of Thailand the place is horrible it is the capital of the Thai sex industry which I think says it all and there were lots of wrinkley old men with 20 year old girls and there are prostitutes everywhere.
It is just completely acceptable there which we found really strange.
Also it has been completely taken over by Russians so there was not a lot of Thai culture at all and it was so expensive.
One thing that was good about Pattaya was our hostel it was so nice ad clean and we had a huuuge room.
We were booked into this place for one night and then we had two nights booked in another.
We went to the second hotel the next day and it was awful it looked like a prison and when we went into our room it had ants all over the side.
After 20 mins we just thought no way are we staying here so asked for a refund so we could go back to the nice place.
At first they argued and would only give us half the money but then DSCF0401 Michael bargained with the man and we got almost all of it back.
We had been warned about how horrible Pattaya was but that was where we had to go to spend the day in the elephant village.
The elephants were amazing!!! we got to ride them into the grassland where they fed for a few hours and then we washed them and spent time with them.
My elephant was called Jandi and Michaels was called Simoon.
I would happily do it again anyday - We didnt really do much in Pattaya because we thought it was best to save our money for the islands.
But we did meet a really nice girl called Andrea who gave us loads of tips and advice.
We travelled to Pattaya with her and back to Bangkok.
We have also decided to change our route sligtly and instead of going to Phuket we are going to go to an island called Koh Tao straight after the full moon party.
The island looks so pretty and it is famous for scuba diving so we are thinking about taking a begginers course if we have enough money.
Yesterday we came back to Bangkok DSCF0402 and stayed at the D&D inn on Khao San Road .
Last night we both got a massage and then sat in the roof top pool which is open til midnight!! We are getting on the Night train tonight and heading to Koh Samui sooo excited.
- but a little scared about the train hahaha xxx Miss and love you all Katie & Michael X x x x x « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 26 Displayed 23 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Michael and Katie Michael and Katie We are off around the world for 3 months and travelling to Thailand - Malaysia - Singapore - Australia - Fiji We have set up this blog our families and friends can follow where we are and what we are getting up to - Miss you all!!
