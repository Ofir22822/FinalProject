10 Questions from 2 Years of Traveling the World 09/12/2014 by Kristin 59 Comments Every now and then my mind drifts back to two Christmases ago on Bottle Beach where I met Jason a 50-something British man who had lived in the same simple electricity-free beach bungalow for nine years.
He started traveling the world looking for a new home after his brother passed away leaving behind Italian sports cars a big house and an unused retirement fund.
Once he died all of it went to waste no longer mattered and seemed to have been for nothing.
It was Jasonâ€™s wake-up call.
He stopped chasing money and instead chased peace.
He found it on Bottle Beach so he stayed.
Iâ€™m no Jason but I departed a normalâ€? life in a similar fashion chasing peace and trying form my own opinions on how I should live.
I still donâ€™t have the answers but maybe thatâ€™s because life is really about the questions.
Just about every writer who travels long term eventually puts out a post about things theyâ€™ve learned but for me there are many more questions than answers.
As much as Iâ€™ve traveled outwardly these past two years have gone inward quite a bit as well turning my perceptions upside down and challenging everything I thought I knew.
Here are 10 key questions I realized we need to ask more determined from traveling alone for the past two years 1 Why donâ€™t I realize how rich I am? Having a roof real walls regular meals clean water the technology to read this blog a car no matter how much of a clunker it is access to a credit card or even a bank account and the ability to obtain a passport that permits entry into most countries in this world are massive luxuries that most people do not have.
Itâ€™s easy to get bombarded by rich celebrity worship obsess over how to be thin or look pretty feel inadequate because the guy who just passed you on the freeway drives a Maserati or give too much importance to a Louis Vuitton purse.
Every day weâ€™re convinced that who we are and what we have isnâ€™t good enough.
Leaving the Western world and going to places where scores of people live in shacks with dirty water have no hope of ever leaving their small towns and do the same back-breaking tasks every day with very little chance of ever knowing what itâ€™s like to worry about gaining weight put this into real perspective.
Even the poorest of my circle friends which is actually probably me now is rich beyond imagination compared to the majority of people in the world.
2 Why arenâ€™t generosity openness and compassion valued more than money and beauty? I used to think that the most important things a person could possess were money good looks and power.
Now I realize that so many of those things are fake fleeting and so irrelevant and shallow that I shudder at my former definition of success.
The person who selflessly helps another seeking no recognition or even thanks and manages to smile and be kind most of the time plus doesnâ€™t turn up his nose at a new custom but remains open â€“ heâ€™s the one who I admire and want to spend my time with whether he has money or not.
3 Why do I always think itâ€™s about me? Itâ€™s easy to get frustrated or feel agitated when traveling in a new country where I feel like an outsider because I donâ€™t understand much of anything and canâ€™t comprehend the customs.
Itâ€™s even easier to get upset when I feel Iâ€™ve been cheated or a tout is too aggressive with me.
I feel targeted but thatâ€™s silly because itâ€™s really not about me.
People simply want to pursue happiness instead of suffering.
Maybe that means cheating me or waving me away if helping me might be too much of a hassle.
Taking it personally is the wrong approach.
I do believe that you get out what you put out there but I also believe how random people treat me is usually not about me.
You never know what the full story is 4 Why do I forget that happiness is a choice? Iâ€™m captain of this shipâ€? I often have to tell myself on down days.
If Iâ€™m going to be sad itâ€™s because Iâ€™m letting myself follow negative thought loops.
If Iâ€™m going to be at peace itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve mentally put myself there.
Itâ€™s important to be careful where one puts his or her energy because so much of what we subconsciously think or believe shapes our day-to-day lives in ways that we often canâ€™t see until itâ€™s too late.
I thought traveling would cure all but nothing can because there are positives and negatives that come along with every choice.
Once I realized this and simply pushed out negative thoughts and refused to think of them life became a lot sweeter.
5 Can less really be more? Ever since de-complicating my life and possessing fewer things Iâ€™ve realized how much easier it has been to enjoy every moment.
I for a long time used to make about 20% of the income I used to as an investment banker.
It was miniscule.
It means I had to eat street food stay in cheap countries and take public transport to make ends meet.
It also meant I experienced more local culture ate better and loved and laughed more in my daily life.
6 Can love really last forever? A friend once said to me that all relationships ebb and flow and I realized how right he was once I started traveling leaving some of my best friends and could-have-been romantic partners behind.
Yet the best friends who have always been there for me from back home still are and though our friendships have evolved over time the fact that we continue to put effort in is what makes us close.
The natural state of things is to change.
Itâ€™s OK if a relationship changes because thatâ€™s what life and people do.
Accepting this has made life less stressful and put less pressure on my relationships.
Whatâ€™s real? 7 How much of perception is real? Photoshopped images only the happy moments that show up on Facebook and the acquaintances who seem to be hitting every major milestone of the magic three a masterâ€™s degree marriage and motherhood can make me feel like an utter failure at times.
But thereâ€™s often so much behind the scenes that gets swept under the rug.
Everyone has skeletons in her closet that she hides no matter how issue-free things appear on the surface.
Comparing myself to something that isnâ€™t even real is a recipe for disaster.
As Theodore Roosevelt said comparison is the thief of joy.â€? 8 Why donâ€™t I appreciate what I have achieved more? When I was a kid I envisioned myself going to the exact university I ended up attending.
When I was a teenager I imagined living in Newport Beach one day and climbing the corporate ladder â€“ something I did exactly six years later.
Then I dreamed of buying a one-way ticket and traveling the world building a travel blog and having real readership.
It has all happened and yet I still find ways to be dissatisfied with the present moment always wanting more.
More of what though? Now I realize itâ€™s not about once I do this Iâ€™ll be happyâ€? point #4.
Itâ€™s more about recognizing the triumphs and having pride in my accomplishments while still dreaming and acknowledging that I have and always will have future goals.
When I stop and appreciate that Iâ€™ve done much of what Iâ€™ve set out to do I feel a lot better about what I havenâ€™t yet achieved.
9 Why am I so afraid of getting older? Mark Twain said Do not complain about getting old it is a privilege denied to many.â€? I canâ€™t help it.
I was raised in Southern California and itâ€™s a shallow Hollywood-impacted culture.
We care a lot about our looks and how others perceive us.
It has taken a long time for me to finally realize my body is a vessel and itâ€™s the soul that makes me me.
This may seem overly flowery but appreciating my health amazing life experiences and most importantly freedom are important and only afforded to me because I have survived for as long as I have.
When I think about all of the things Iâ€™ve experienced in my life I realize that each year is the greatest gift I could ever have been blessed with.
Not everyone makes it out of infancy childhood or their early 20s.
10 Why do I think everything I do matters so darn much? I stared up at the stars one night on a boat in Komodo and couldnâ€™t believe how small it made me feel.
It was like I couldnâ€™t matter less in this universe.
Iâ€™m just one small hiccup in millions of years in an endless abyss of particles ideas and energy.
It was incredibly freeing to realize this.
It was like any little mistake I make will never matter and nobody really cares anyways.
Once I realized how little time anyone else devoted to thinking about me as compared to the amount of time I thought people spent judging me I realized I was free.
I can do anything I want because every little thing I do as long as it doesnâ€™t hurt someone else has almost no impact in the long-term.
A few centuries from now itâ€™ll be as if I didnâ€™t even exist.
This isnâ€™t depressing.
Quite the opposite â€“ itâ€™s liberating! The small stuff is not a big deal and little mistakes are meant to be made.
In closing there are a lot of things I learned from two years of traveling like becoming my own boss and spending most of the year in places completely foreign to me.
Chief among them is to never stop asking questions wondering and of course wandering.

Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 1002 am Thanks so much Christina.
It appears youâ€™ve had amazing travels as well! Iâ€™d love to see Tibet.
Reply Franca says 09/12/2014 at 1129 am Once more Kristin you are inspiring others to take the courage of fighting any fear and finally leave the comfort zone.
People need to know how enriching travelling can be but they also need to know everything else that comes with it nothing is always easy and straight forward.
Best wishes and more years of nomadic adventures to come ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 129 pm Aw thank you Franca.
Reply Jeremy says 09/12/2014 at 131 pm Seriously AMEN to everything on this list.
Looking forward to crossing paths with you someday! Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 307 pm Feels weird to me that we havenâ€™t met IRL because it seems like we have!

Thanks for sharing these beautiful observations.

Reply Evran says 09/13/2014 at 653 am Kristin how nice you have realised that facts and also shared with us with your beautifully fluent and inspiring writing.
Reply Kristin says 09/13/2014 at 1119 am Haha beautifully fluent.
German is next! ð?˜‰ Reply Kaleenas Kaleidoscope says 09/13/2014 at 737 am Great questions! I particularly relate to #8.
I think itâ€™s a trap that people like us with ambitious perfectionistic tendencies tend to fall into.
I have to constantly remind myself that by living abroad I AM living what I used to dream of even though right now I catch myself feeling like Iâ€™m not accomplishing much.
And itâ€™s trueâ€“Iâ€™m totally afraid of aging now when I know I shouldnâ€™t.
But these wrinklesâ€“theyâ€™re really setting in! haha.
Lovely post.
ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 09/13/2014 at 1118 am Itâ€™s definitely a trap but also part of our culture so itâ€™s a hard thing to shake.
I agree with the wrinkles and every time I see a new one Iâ€™m like noooo!â€? but itâ€™s inevitable so the two choices are to embrace it or fight it and the latter battle isnâ€™t one I want to wage.
Reply Rika | Cubicle Throwdown says 09/13/2014 at 1050 am Wonderful post Kristin! Love how you framed it with questions.
Very insightful! Reply Rachel of Hippie in Heels says 09/14/2014 at 353 am I really enjoyed reading this.
Number 7 is one I struggle with.
Actually I think in blogging it becomes a competition sometimes so adding that on top of personal life is a lot of comparison that I canâ€™t help making.
Before I travel blogged and worked as a nurse I wasnâ€™t ever wondering if someone was a better nurse than me- but choosing a job of writing in a public space has changed a lot.
Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 927 am I agree that in that regard I always feel inferior but then I look at the people who have larger readerships and they have definitely been around for longer and longevity has a lot to do with success.
Working more and more and more are what lead to success in just about any field I can think of.
Experience is what you need.
Isnâ€™t easy but itâ€™s a journey and a great one once you start to see it paying dividends.
Reply Katie Featherstone says 09/14/2014 at 458 pm The main thing I take away from travelling is that life is just whatever you make it.
Travel just means we can leave all the mundane behind and try and find something new and exciting- like you said you make your own happiness.
Thought provoking post thank-you.
Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 824 pm Very true.
Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 824 pm Gratitude is huge and compassion.
Those two are major for me.
Reply Silvia says 09/15/2014 at 324 am This are such great questions to raise! I tell myself that Iâ€™ve broken free by deciding to travel and write instead of pursuing a normalâ€? career but in many ways Iâ€™ve just attached myself to a new set of standards set by travelers and travel bloggers.
Itâ€™s important to step back sometimes and reassess my priorities.
Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 820 am Thatâ€™s such a good point.
You leave one routine but inevitably pick up another.
Just has to be all well in your heart.
Reply Chris A Sharpe says 09/15/2014 at 925 am A touching analysis of the things we all think when travelling a long time but are too afraid to talk about.
The questions you ask are tough and can only really be understood through experience.
Everyone at one point in their life will have been guilty having these thoughts doubts and fears opening up and breaking down these misconceptions is something to be applauded.
Excellent use of a Mark Twain quote as well a personal fave Do not complain about getting old it is a privilege denied to many.â€? Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 951 am That quote was big for me once I discovered it and really put things into perspective.
Why are we so afraid of getting old? I guess for most it feels closer to death but that could happen any time.
Reply Abi says 09/15/2014 at 939 am So glad you pointed out number oneâ€¦If only more people could realise! Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 950 am I think it takes traveling to realize.
Leaving your bubble is so important and most people never do.
Reply Ayngelina says 09/15/2014 at 1214 pm I donâ€™t think travel ever solves these questions but maybe makes us feel more comfortable that we donâ€™t know the answers.
Or maybe the older I get the less I need to feel like I have everything under control.
Donâ€™t fear age Iâ€™m happier each year.
Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 123 pm I also wonder if itâ€™s just maturity or travel that has helped me feel less worried about not having the answers.
Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a combination of both but traveling was definitely a catalyst.
Reply Abby says 09/15/2014 at 129 pm Our society almost makes us feel guilty for being content I know I should be happy butâ€¦â€? Beautiful beautiful post.
Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 150 pm So very true.
Itâ€™s like saying I donâ€™t want anything more and Iâ€™m happy with thisâ€? feels arrogant but why should it be? Thank you Abby ð?™‚ Reply Alana - Paper Planes says 09/15/2014 at 957 pm I loved reading this Kristin and have many of the same nagging questions.
While traveling has opened up my world in wonderful ways and made me more comfortable in some truths in reality itâ€™s made me question things more and become even less sure of things than I was before I left homeâ€¦ Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 1105 pm So true.
I question a lot more but I think thatâ€™s a good thing.
Reply Alex says 09/19/2014 at 1239 am Wow Kristin I canâ€™t tell you how much I love this post.
Iâ€™ve come back to it and reread it a few times now! Iâ€™m going to keep a lot of these questions in mind for my own self reflection.
I found myself saying I am the captain of this shipâ€? when I woke up to some unpleasant thoughts this morning! Love love love.
Reply Kristin says 09/19/2014 at 900 am Thatâ€™s wonderful! Iâ€™m so glad it made a positive impact.
Thanks for the amazing comment <3 Reply Angie Away says 09/19/2014 at 758 am Awesome post! Thought-provoking! Traveling has certainly made me ask a lot of these same questions â€” and even though I continually come back to the same answers I find myself getting caught up in the non-important stuff over and over.
Itâ€™s great to be reminded of the big lessons I learned while on the road full time so thank you! Reply Rekha Devarapalli says 09/19/2014 at 905 am Beautifully written Kristin!! Reply Jess says 09/19/2014 at 1058 am Wow â€“ you have just summarised everything Iâ€™ve been thinking and feeling for the past 6 months.
Thatâ€™s why I so love reading these blogs.
Iâ€™ve just moved to Thailand for two years itâ€™s been my plan for 5 years.
Now Iâ€™m so happy but the first few weeks I was like â€“ ok what next?! Enjoy the moment is the best advice Iâ€™ve given myself ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 09/19/2014 at 1116 am Good for you! Thailand is awesome.
Reply Laura says 09/19/2014 at 939 pm Very though-provoking.
Number 4 is a big one for me especially when getting pulled into the sometimes drama of daily read work concerns.
Reply Kristin says 09/20/2014 at 1219 pm Itâ€™s hard to remember to just push bad thoughts out but when I can do so effectively itâ€™s a big help.
Reply Simone says 09/20/2014 at 241 am This has to be one of my favourite and most thought provoking posts of yours! Youâ€™ve given me a lot of food for thought ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 09/20/2014 at 1218 pm Yay! The good response on this has led me to write more similar posts.
Reply Camels & Chocolate says 09/23/2014 at 857 am YES to all of these but especially NUMBERS THREE and TEN.
This is so thought-provoking and lovely.
Enjoyed reading it! Reply Kristin says 09/23/2014 at 915 am Iâ€™m glad you enjoyed! Reply Joyce says 09/23/2014 at 1204 pm I love how travel changed your perspective.
Thanks for sharing I always love to hear other peopleâ€™s stories and lessons learned.
Reply Kristin says 09/23/2014 at 1256 pm I do as well.
I always find those kinds of posts to be very uplifting.
Reply Mary says 10/18/2014 at 605 am Bravo! What a brilliant philosophy you have developed through your travelling.
Mine is similar! As a 75 year old wrinkley who still loves solo travel let me reassure you that wrinkles donâ€™t matter a jot.
In fact I believe they have become an advantage while I am travelling the world! Thank you for a great read.
I found your site through Nomadic Matt.
May your journey throughout the world continue to bring you many more joys with no troubles.
Mary.
Reply Kristin says 10/18/2014 at 345 pm Thanks Mary! Really nice to have your thoughts on the beauty of aging and traveling solo at 75! My grandmother traveled a lot as well and I always looked up to her for that among many other reasons.
Reply Anne says 11/07/2014 at 927 pm Beautifully stated.
Everything! We have just been justâ€? on the road for 10 months and I can genuinely relate to these questions.
And to your point about how much of perception is real.
It goes both ways.
I post pictures and send my friends and family pictures of all the FUN things we doâ€¦ but there are also the very REAL moments of long term travel like this that arenâ€™t so glamorous that donâ€™t often get told.
ð?™‚ I know you can relate to that too! Keep doing what youâ€™re doingâ€¦ I think youâ€™re amazing! Reply Kristin says 11/09/2014 at 1154 am Thanks Anne ð?™‚ Iâ€™ve written posts from time to time about the non glamorous side but itâ€™s hard to understand until you go right? Otherwise it just sounds like griping about an otherwise awesome lifestyle.
Lots of REAL moments traveling thatâ€™s for sure.
Reply ChasinJason13 says 11/11/2014 at 1054 am #11- Why in the hell did I think that what I wanted or even thought I wanted before I went to would be the same things I wanted when I returned? What did I think going on adventures of a lifetime would just cement in me that everything I was doing before was right on the money? You know itâ€™s cliche these days to say that youâ€™re going traveling to find yourselfâ€? but I for one have found much more of myself out there -wherever thereâ€? may be- than I ever have at home.
Reply Kristin says 11/11/2014 at 1137 am I have as well and honestly I think traveling does help you find your true self â€“ without the influences values and judgements affecting your decisions like they did when surrounded by a certain type of society friends and family.
No matter how well-meaning we affect each otherâ€™s decisions.
Once youâ€™re on your own exploring the world you start to realize how capable you were all along of making your choices on your own.
Itâ€™s pretty cool.
Reply Alex B says 11/13/2014 at 731 pm I love this so much! Iâ€™m bookmarking this under my Inspiration for when I get down on the roadâ€? folder ð?˜‰ Reply Kristin says 11/14/2014 at 323 am Aw thanks and thatâ€™s a really good idea to keep something like that.
I think this one is really good to stick in there too http//zenpencils.com/comic/98-alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object/ Reply Martina Donkers says 11/18/2014 at 652 pm Hey Kristin ð?™‚ This is such a beautiful post and an affirmation to life.
Itâ€™s so important to remember what we have how privileged we are in our travels and how much of the world there is to explore.
Martina ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 11/19/2014 at 411 am Thanks Martina.
Agreed ð?™‚ Reply Navraj says 07/08/2017 at 842 am You get a perfect ten for your thoughts! But like you said about relationships itâ€™s true of ourselves too.
Feelings and emotions also keep ebbing and flowing.
The key is to remain centered by being in harmony & balance with all our surroundings and most importantly with ourselves.
Happiness is our choice our responsibility to ourselves.
I have observed that itâ€™s not bad that relationships change.
Those which help each other grow and experience life in a much deeper & more meaningful way tend to flourish.
Life is beautiful and we need to disconnect the thought that happiness depends on getting something or someone.
