What to Wear in India A Complete Guide for Women Travellers and Men!.
Itâ€™s no secret that India is at least one of our favourite travel destinations on the planet.
Thereâ€™s enough to awe entertain and inspire you here for months if not years â€“ and many a traveller has fallen for Indiaâ€™s charms.
India also seems to suffer from something of a reputation problem though â€“ particularly when it comes to the topic of female travel.
The question of solo female travel in India is hotly debated and with it a certain emphasis comes on how to carry yourself and how to dress in India.
India is a sub-continent populated by over a billion people.
Times are changing fast and India is firmly set to become one of our worldâ€™s economic powerhouses.
Although we may see pictures of poverty tradition and rural India on social media the country is far more than that.
Mumbai is reportedly home to the greatest number of billionaires in the world and youâ€™re just as likely to see beautiful girls in hot pants on a saturday night out as women in sarees.

Rather there are as many answers as there are times of day â€“ such are the nuances of this rapidly changing country and culture.
But fear not.

This is a mini-guide to clothing for travel in India what to avoid myths about what to wear in India and sensitivities to be aware of.

Our Indian Uniformâ€? â€“ Ravi in jeans & t-shirt me in Salwar Kameez Dressing for Safe Travel in India Weâ€™re guessing what brought you to this post is your desire to a be safe travelling in India and b be culturally appropriate and respectful while travelling in India.
Firstly Thank You! The world needs many more sensitive travellers like you.
Secondly Despite the warnings and cautionary tales India is an incredibly rewarding place to travel and the vast majority of female and male travellers who venture here do not experience any trouble.
If you follow your common sense keep an eye on your surroundings and are aware of how you are perceived then it will increase your safety too! How you dress does have a direct impact on how you may be perceived during your trip to India â€“ especially if youâ€™re venturing off the beaten path.
Which is why how to dress in India as a tourist is an often debated topic.
Whatever you wear in India if you have a non-Indian skin tone either lighter or darker and different colour hair you will stand out.
But wearing revealing clothes on top of that can add some masala to the attention.
Which you probably donâ€™t want! Foreign women are sometimes perceived as exoticâ€? and naturally attract increased interest in what is still a male dominated society where women are in short supply â€“ so to mitigate that you want to cover up more than you might at home while staying cool.

Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts of dressing in India Based on our experiences here are a few Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts Do look around you Take note of what local women are wearing what areas of the body they are covering and take your queue from them weâ€™re not saying you have to buy a saree but if everyone around you is in shorts youâ€™re probably fine in the same.
Do ask if youâ€™re not sure Ask local friends if you have them ask other hotel/hostel guests or ask tour guides for feedback on what youâ€™re wearing if youâ€™re really not sure.
If youâ€™re at the beach donâ€™t wear swimwear off the beach even just to cross the road to get your coconut water.
Many of Indiaâ€™s beautiful beaches are actually in more conservative communities depending where in the country you are and not dressing properly causes offence.
In Goa or at resort beaches bikinis are fine but on local beaches itâ€™s better to swim partially clothed a loose t-shirt over your swimsuit is a good idea.
Donâ€™t ever sunbathe topless.
Even if you think no-one can see you they probably can.
And do you really want your nude top half going viral on WhatsApp? Donâ€™t show lots of leg.
Youâ€™ll see that locals regardless of where you are very rarely show leg.
Itâ€™s best to wear long trousers and skirts.
An exception is some beach towns Goa and Varkala being the obvious examples where shorts can be fine.
Donâ€™t show cleavage or wear strappy tops.
In more liberal parts of the country sleeveless shirts or tunics are fine whereas in other places youâ€™ll feel more comfortable in sleeves.
Do avoid overly tight figure hugging clothes.
Protect that booty by covering it with a long / loose top or loose pants/trousers! Do wear bright colours Not only will they make your feel more cheerful youâ€™ll blend in to Indiaâ€™s rainbow of colour! Dispelling a Few Myths Given that India has been portrayed in a certain light in the media travel advice tends so err on the cautious and a limited view of what it is like to live and travel in India has developed.
Letâ€™s be clear on a few things.
Itâ€™s not always hot in India.
Depending on when and where you travel you may need warmer layers too.
You donâ€™t need to cover your hair in India unless youâ€™re entering a Sikh or Muslim religious shrine/temple/mosque You donâ€™t need to wear Indian clothing â€“ see more below! Younger Indians are just as likely to be sporting t-shirts and skinny jeans than traditional Indian dress.
It all depends on where you are! You donâ€™t have to wear elephant pants.
India is loved as a hippy backpacking destination but it is perfectly possible to travel here and look smart too! You can wear jewellery â€“ just maybe leave your diamond collection / family jewels at home.
Many Indians wear a lot of jewellery so donâ€™t be afraid to get some local jewellery for yourself too negotiate!.
â“˜ TIP Planning a trip to India? Click here to get our FREE India Travel Checklist! Should you Dress Local? For my first solo trip to India I followed the advice that wearing local clothing would earn me more respect and be safer as a solo female traveller.
I headed out shopping and got myself a few kurtas tunic style long tops with splits below the waist â€“ they vary in length from just below the bum to below the knee as well as a custom made salwaar kameez.
All of this was great fun and very inexpensive but I found myself attracting plenty of attention and comments for my Indian-style attire particularly in the big cities.
I found myself wondering Would I just have blended in better if I had been wearing western clothes? The answer is probably yes in some situations.
Clearly weâ€™re not advocating wandering around India in a backpack and saree hardly the most comfortable combination.
Here are a few guidelines based on our experiences In cities or touristy areas think Goa Mumbai Bangalore Delhi Rishikesh Ladakh etc youâ€™re fine in western clothes or a Kurta and leggings / jeans.
In rural areas and villages youâ€™ll need to dress more conservatively and local clothing can help here for women.
We suggest wearing Kurta + Leggings or a Punjabi Suit / Salwar Kameez baggy trousers + kurta top.
Some parts of India are more conservative than others â€“ e.g.
Uttar Pradesh & Rajasthan are more traditional than Maharashtra so local clothing as above for rural India can be helpful.
If in doubt Look at what the local women of your age around you are wearing and use that as a barometer.
In general Sarees are the preserve of married Indian women and we donâ€™t recommend wearing them out and about on your travels for visitors unless you are invited to wear one to a special occasion or event such as a wedding.
Buying one as a souvenir is of course fine! The one time I got to wear a saree in India! What to Wear in India The Essentials Here are our recommended essential items for dressing in India for Women.
Go for natural fibres / fabrics whereever you can as these keep you cooler and are more comfortable plus they are better for the environment.
Accessories Sunglasses â€“ not only for keeping the sun out but great for avoiding any stares or would be Romeoâ€™s.
We love ethical brand Pala Eyewear.
A secure handbag / purse.
We love crossbody bags as you can keep them in front of you and on your person at all times iâ€™ve always used crossbody bags when travelling in India.
A basic leather one is good or for added security you can use a Travelon one which has additional security measures built in! Top Half Scarves Scarves Scarves.
Drape them across your chest backwards like a dupatta Indian Style wrap them over your head in the heat or around your shoulders to keep warm in AC.
You will find so many uses for your scarf! We recommend 1 x Thin / light Linen Cotton or Hemp Scarf and 1 x Thicker Shawl which you can also use a blanket on AC trains etc Tunic tops / loose shirts or blouses â€“ we love this one and this one T-shirts â€“ preferably made from organic cotton hemp or bamboo such as these ones Kurta tops â€“ you can buy them online if you just canâ€™t wait until you get to India ð?˜‰ Warmer Layer such as a fleece or hoodie always take one warmer layer for air conditioned transport and winter in North India High quality organic cotton/bamboo vest tops are useful for wearing under a blouse / kurta if itâ€™s really hot and you donâ€™t want to wear a bra â€“ personally I find they really dig in in the heat.
Cotton layers actually help to keep you cool ð?™‚ Bottom Half Loose fitting harem pants or Linen trousers like these Leggings only wear under a long top that covers your bottom Jeans â€“ skinny or regular we suggest 1 pair is enough Modest shorts for the beach not ones that expose your â€˜cheeks! A long loose skirt or Linen trousers like these â€“ skirts are great for bus travel in case you have to go to the bathroom in nature! Make sure your long skirt is not too tight and doesnâ€™t have tall slits in the side.
I saw a girl wearing a long skirt with thigh-high slits in at the Taj Mahal â€“ and every man in sight was gaping at her.
&ampampampampltbr /&ampampampampgt Swimwear for India A loose fitting kaftan or maxi dress can be handy if youâ€™ll be hitting the beach A bikini or swimsuit is fine for resorts or the touristy beaches of Goa.
On local beaches or in the countryside we suggest swimming with a t-shirt & shorts on as locals swim fully clothed.
Donâ€™t ever walk around off the beach in your swimwear My typical Mumbai attire T shirt skinny jeans and scarf Footwear We suggest taking a pair of sandals / flip flops for chilling out in we love Reef who contribute to cleaning up beaches around the world.
These are also super useful for visiting temples where you need to remove shoes.
A pair of covered pumps / canvas shoes such as Toms for travel and walking around cities you donâ€™t want step in something nasty Hiking shoes if youâ€™re going to be trekking breathable ones are recommended and make sure you wear them in beforehand You can buy cheap chuppelsâ€? in India pretty decorated sandals so leave plenty of space in your bag! &ampampampampltbr /&ampampampampgt What to Wear for Yoga in India Leave your tight leggings racerbacks and spandex at home! A loose fitting t-shirt Baggy yoga trousers / harem pants Yoga in India is a modest affair and you wonâ€™t see the tight yoga clothes that have become a staple of westernâ€? yoga.
Try to bring tops you can tuck into your trousers to avoid flashing during your downward dogs! Pin me for Later! Knowing What to Wear and When As youâ€™ll see in our should I dress in local clothingâ€? section â€“ we recommend adapting what you wear depending on where you are in India.
The easiest way to judge this is to look at what people your age are wearing around you.
In general in cities and touristy areas you are fine in western clothing but do stick to the rules of not showing your shoulders chest or legs above the shin.
Even in some more touristic areas â€“ notably Agra Varanasi and other parts of central India these regions are more conservative and you will want to cover more than youâ€™d need to on the beaches of Goa.
In other specific situations such as going on Tiger or other Wildlife Safaris in India youâ€™ll want to be covered and wearing neutral tones â€“ leave that beautiful bright red top at home.
â“˜ TIP Travel Insurance is a must for India â€“ we use and recommend World Nomads â€“ Get your quote here! What to Wear in India for Men Ah guys you have it so easy! Much of the debate around how to dress as a traveller to India is related to women because of the traditional society that exists there.
As a man you can wear pretty much what you would at home although a few things to bear in mind Shorts are not popular in India except on the beach.
You can wear them but you wonâ€™t see many Indian men wearing them in towns and cities.
If youâ€™re going to any formal type of event donâ€™t wear shorts.
Donâ€™t go topless again unless youâ€™re on the beach You donâ€™t need to wear local clothing â€“ even in villages.
Youâ€™ll get a few odd looks if you wander India in a Salwar Kameez! The best bet? Jeans / Chinos and t-shirts / shirts.
We recommend light jeans and cotton t-shirts or polo shirts for a slightly smarter look.
Final Words of Advice If you research in advance like reading this post! and do your packing right you wonâ€™t have to worry about what to wear in India when youâ€™re there! Job done! We recommend not packing too much flexibility and items you can mix/match are the key â€“ not least because there are so many beautiful clothes scarves and accessories youâ€™ll want to buy once youâ€™re there!
