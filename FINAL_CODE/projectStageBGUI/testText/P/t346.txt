Started yesterday 630am hopped in the bus and listened to our tour guide talk about everything weâ€™re going to do.
Sounds like this is going to be a wicked trip.
But it could very well get costly I just paid $105 for one night food/stay/activities but it was so very worth it.
The group is awesome and the place we stayed is super cool.
Itâ€™s remade to look like a mining village and the activities included a choice of night kayaking/horseback riding/Abseiling going down a cliff on a rope/mountain biking.
I chose Night kayaking and biking.
After a free lunch a guy from Jersey UK named Chris and I headed Mountain biking which was said to be quite extreme.
After a 20 min bus ride we were at the start of the trail and on our way.
The Biking really was extreme it was straight downhill with ruts on either side of a dirt path.
One wrong move and youâ€™re flying over your handle bars at 50km.
After white knuckling my way down we were at the last hill and I hadnâ€™t fallen.
One more little hill to go one STEEP little hill.
I fell Opera House three times over my handle bars and missed cow shit by a foot.
The widow makerâ€? made me its newest member of the widow club.
We came back for some relax and then all you can eat pizza for $10.
From there we were off to night kayaking which is literally what it sounds.
We were going down class 3 rapids in the dark with nothing but a headlamp and really ugly wetsuits.
I Purposely chose the ugliest one I could find.
It wasnâ€™t as exciting as expected but still a good time I led the pack down the rapids only a few times getting caught on rocks.
I eventually started looking for people on rock and just started ramming into them as hard as I could.
They were inflatable kayaks so I figure it was all safe.
From the kayaking the story goes to As every good story does alcohol.
We grabbed our beer and hopped in the hot tub.
After probably three too many a few of us including Celeste and Tom  ran down to the creek to scare the second group of kayakers as they finished their trip.
We swam through the creek underwater Chris Jersey ON the way to biking and jumped up pretending we were platypus Iâ€™m still convinced they were scared shitless even though they wonâ€™t admit it.
The night continued in its drunken mess and before long I was passed out from fatigue and alcohol.
Itâ€™s now Day two and weâ€™re on the bus to some place for surf lessons.
Should be fun now that Im â€˜intermediateâ€™! Thesteps.com.au for pictures more pictures.
Today we pretty much drove all day.
We made it to the surf camp at Cresent Head and had some surfing.
Im stealing their signals Im a common day thief now its time for more drinking and sitting around the campfire.
Having so much fun and so happy to be on this tour.
I making good friends with some of these people already.
PS - I took my laptop.
oops.
