Each winter in the month of February runners from all around gather for its annual half marathon.
This year over 2500 runners toed the line in what is touted as the fastest half marathon in the worldâ€?.
I was one of these runners taking on a course that from an aerial view appears to be right out of the 90s adventure puzzle computer game of Myst.
Run on Al Marjan Island in RAK this series of 4 connected man-made islands extends 4.5 kilometers Everything is metric in this country and itâ€™s hard to get used to into the Arabian Sea or Persian Gulf to some and covers 4.5 million square meters thatâ€™s a lot.
This yearâ€™s race had fabulous weather for this area pushing the mercury to 56 degrees at the gun.
A vast group of elite women started the race at 645am with the elite men starting at 700am along with the mass start of everyone else.
Course A group of 4 Ethiopian ladies finished first with the top finisher Senbere Teferi crossing with a time of 10545 tying the #10 fastest in the world 10451.
Not long after the menâ€™s top finisher Stephen Kiprop of Kenya crossed the finish with a time of 5842 which beat Ethiopiaâ€™s Abadi Hadis by 2 seconds.
Kipropâ€™s time tied him for the 6th fastest finish in the world 5818.
I was not as speedy as these top finishers having just come back from injury and not getting in a long run over 10 miles for three weeks.
That said and taking into account the lack of conditioning and training I held my own and ran a good 10 miles before the tank ran out of gas finishing with at time of 22517.
Obviously not my best but not my worst finish either.
Support along the course was pretty good and was located about every 2.5km.
Bottled water is what everyone drinks in the UAE so each runner was handed a small bottle as they came through the water stop.
Each kilometer was marked which means 21 in all.
Mentally this messes with my head so I keep my watch on miles because 13.1 miles is much easier to run than 21.1km.
After running my second half marathon in the UAE I find that these races are very well organized.
Bib numbers are assigned upon signing up for the race and race pictures are sent to you minutes after you cross the finish line.
Not only that but you donâ€™t have to pay to download the pictures so there isnâ€™t a large logo superimposed across your face.
This race had your packet shipped to you via UPS that included a race shirt along with your bib.
Once you finished you were handed a medal that weighed about 5 lbs and a finishers bagâ€? which included a nice towel the second race I received a towel and a race branded coffee cup.
The racing season here will soon be wrapping up as come April the temperatures will begin to rise along with the humidity.
It is not unheard of for the temperatures to top out around 110-120 degrees.
Even early morning temperatures will be uncomfortable with the humidity but at least the sun wonâ€™t be beating down on you.
Here is to hoping I will survive the UAE summer.

For me this was huge.
I have never lived anywhere other than the east coast of the US and I will say I never really considered myself a world traveler....until now.
Enjoy the information and adventures...and if nothing else you can live vicariously through me.
