It was a desolate sort of building that gave off a haunted house vibe located atop an isolated hill.
Wakkanai was still being deluged by buckets of rain and after a while I began to feel somewhat trapped the early stages of cabin fever were imminent.
I walked around the empty hostel in an attempt to keep myself busy but there was no one else around.
Reception was only open for a couple of hours each day and the elderly gentleman receptionist mostly appeared to be interested in staring at the wall.
Each morning I would awake and pull back the curtains to expose the watery world of Wakkanai.
Then Iâ€™d let out a heavy sigh before trudging downstairs to reception to book yet another night in the house that time forgot.
The receptionist would also sigh in disgust at my request and thus the cycle continued.
One would have thought that my saving grace would have been the television in my room yet unfortunately this would only add to my misery as it allowed me to bear witness to World Cup Fever on the little screen the tragedy of Englandâ€™s offensively disgraceful World Cup campaign and the less said about that sham the better.
Wakkanai - Shosanbetsu 74 miles On my fourth day there a heavier than normal sigh ensued as I skulked downstairs to reception.
â€˜Ohayo gozaimasuâ€™ good morning I said to the receptionist who seemed a little disgruntled by the fact that Iâ€™d just disturbed his reverie of boredom.
â€˜Oh...
Ohayo gozaimasuâ€™ he begrudgingly replied.
â€˜Mou hitoban onegai shimasuâ€™ one more night please.
â€˜Anoâ€¦ chotto...â€™ hmmâ€¦ ermâ€¦well.
He was being hesitant about something.
â€˜Oh mondai desu ka?â€™ Oh is there a problem? The receptionist then went on to tell me that the hostel was full.
â€˜What??â€™ I said in English the word echoing down the baron hallway and it probably still is.
I then took a good look around me making a point to observe one of the buildingâ€™s main proficienciesâ€¦ its sheer emptiness.
â€˜Honto ni?â€™ Seriously?I said marginally miffed.
â€˜Hai sou desu gomen neâ€™ Yes thatâ€™s right sorry about that.
Before going on to confirm that check out was at 10am.
I looked at my watch it was 950am.
I Shosanbetsu sighed so hard I almost destroyed myself.
11 minutes later and I was reaquainted with a classic drenching as I began to work my way south on the long road towards Okinawa.
Although despite the damp conditions there was a certain jubilance about being back on the road again.
The act of being just ever so slightly more productive than being sat on oneâ€™s arse in a crummy hostel room was one of pure invigoration.
I was reaping the positives from the negatives.
Yes it was pissing it down but I was back in the saddle and more importantly I was happy to be there! After a couple of hours I came across an unmanned road side rest area.
It was a small wooden structure immaculately clean offering toilets cooking facilities a dining area and an enticingly huge gas heater.
It was open to the weary traveller in a gesture of goodwill and trust a true pyromaniacâ€™s paradise.
Feeling the increasing need to take all my clothes off I stripped away my seemingly non-waterproof waterproofs.
Firing up the gas heater I began to dry my belongings.
The rain continued to hammer it down outside like it had nothing Hokkaido else better to do.
Inside under shelter and around the now raging warmth of the gas heater I took it upon myself to learn the Japanese words for human body parts laughing childishly to myself upon learning the words for both male and female genitalia.
With my clothes subsequently dried and the onset of boredom beginning to deliver itself once more I decided to saddle up and head out into the rain.
I hugged the coast for several more hours the weather eventually clearing shortly before my arrival in the village of Shosanbetsu.
I lucked out here by finding the Misakidai camping ground perched upon a scenic cliff edge overlooking the oceanâ€™s calm and gentle waters.
The sun clung to the horizon its bright fiery reflection trailblazing across the Sea of Japan.
The camp site also had the added bonus of being free.
Well when I say free nobody asked me for any money.
Andâ€¦ the extra prize of an onsite onsen was also added to the playlist.
This I should note however was not free but for a meagre Â£1.80 the price of cleanliness was wholesomely affordable.
I found it hard initially to conquer the idea Shosanbetsu of having a big bath with other completely butt naked strangers.
Was I a prude? Well yes but growing up in conservative England where having a bath was private behind closed doors dictated my abstract gingerness.
In Japan the baths are segregated by sex as to presumably discourage a modest amount of jizzing.
After removing oneâ€™s clothes and placing them in a small basket one can collect a modesty towel to cover oneâ€™s sausage.
But a Japanese bathhouse is a place of etiquette you canâ€™t just simply go waltzing in after a long hard sweaty days work and belly flop straight into the shared bathing facilitiesâ€¦ that would be the most heinous of bath crimes.
One must shower first and properly too.
A row of stalls bordering on toddlerâ€™s potties are generally provided along with a selection of soaps shampoos and a big mirror so you can presumably check out your junk in its reflection - or not.
Here one must take the time to liberate oneâ€™s self of a day of grime scrubbing hard and furiously so that one is presentable for public bathing.
When one enters the bath one should essentially be a shiny clean entity img_5163 so if your elbows arenâ€™t sparkling - youâ€™re not coming in! When my elbows were eventually gleaming Iâ€™d find that there were a number of baths available for me to explore all of different shapes and sizes and seemingly varying temperatures - inclusive of an outside bath which would turn out to be my favourite.
Again as I appeared to be the only tourist travelling through HokkaidÅ? at this moment the bathhouse was far from crowded.
It was an appeasing relaxant after a long dayâ€™s arduous journeying in the rain.
Now that I was familiar with this luxury it would become one that I would take advantage of more in the months to come.
