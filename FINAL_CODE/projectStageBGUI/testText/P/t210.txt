How to Stay Healthy on the Road 10/24/2017 by Kristin 30 Comments Pin me! This post has been on my mind for a few months now as a follow-up to the post about me gaining weight while I was traveling.
I was going to title it How I Have Lost My Travel Weight with all of the workouts and new habits that I have employed to get back to a leaner and more muscular me but in the end Iâ€™ve decided I really donâ€™t like this title or this topic at all.
Because all throughout my life I have been way too preoccupied with how I look.
I learned this from a society that is obsessed with looks.
Has this celebrity gained weight? Is she pregnant? 10 Celebrities Who Never Seem to Age.
or worse yet 10 Celebrities Who Have Aged Horribly.
Itâ€™s messed up man.
Every day on my Instagram feed at the grocery store checkout and in transit I am constantly confronted with â€˜perfect bodiesâ€™ and the same damn aesthetic often photo shopped or just with amazing angles and lighting While I have lost about 10 pounds of fat I really donâ€™t want that to be the focus here.
I want the topic of this article to be health.
Much of the reason why I gained weight previously is because I was not taking care of myself.
I noted in the article about gaining weight that I often looked in the mirror and felt a mountain of self loathing holding me down.
I really hated the girl who was looking back at me.
That is so sad.
I was not acting in healthy ways A few months later I worked my way out of my spiral of self-pity and I had started to lose some of the weight through healthy diet and exercise and most of all working on self love.
This was not an easy road.
It took some time before I saw changes but I stuck to it because at the very least the endorphins felt great.
I tracked my progress in a follow up post and when I was starting to feel better about my body again a few really rude comments about my â€˜boxy assâ€™ came through on Instagram and on this blog.
I wrote about them a bit on here because I wanted to take the power away from the trolls by exposing the ugly nature of body shaming rather than just pretending it wasnâ€™t happening.
I wish I could say that they didnâ€™t get to me.
But I do look in the mirror and wonder about my ass.
A few people mentioned that I shouldnâ€™t listen and even others said that I was overreacting and that body shaming is just a normal part of life for women.
Oh yeah trolls? Hereâ€™s my ass again.
Discuss.
But I think itâ€™s only normal because we allow it.
Itâ€™s not about being skinny or having the perfect body itâ€™s about achieving your perfect body â€“ the one that makes you feel good empowered and healthy.
So instead of how to get skinny this post is actually about getting healthier.
It is so much more than physical.
Being healthy is in large part mental.
Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing to stay leaner more muscular and a lot healthier Not making excuses about my diet on the road In Patagonia I often said that I couldnâ€™t eat healthier because of lack of availability.
However I could have gone to greater efforts to cook my own food and it wouldnâ€™t have hurt if I laid off the ice cream and nightly wine either.
Eating whole foods â€“ mostly plants The easiest way for me to drop weight is to stop eating carbs that donâ€™t occur from whole foods.
So I allow lentils beans and sweet potatoes but cut out bread pasta and sugars that donâ€™t come from fruits and other whole foods.
Allow a cheat day Itâ€™s still important to enjoy myself so cheat days are allowed! Sampling the local cuisine even the unhealthy stuff is part of the travel experience.
I just limit it more than I used to.
Finding exercises you really enjoy Find that thing you look forward to.
If you hate running why run? Maybe you will like dance aerobics or swimming or Pilates much more.
This is what works for me Finding YouTube workouts that require no equipment and that I enjoy particularly PopSugar fitness and Blogilates.
I also made a playlist for exercises I can even do when I donâ€™t have a mat so there are no excuses! Groupon on the go I search for classes that I can get discounts to when I know Iâ€™ll be in an area for any reasonable length of time.
I take a weekly pole dancing class now in Berlin.
Itâ€™s empowering and even though Iâ€™m sore for almost a week following each class I can tell Iâ€™m getting way stronger with each passing week.
Working exercise into travels Make your vacations active ones! I love to go paddling like in Manitoba and swimming diving and hiking.
In cities in Europe I walk.
I always look for ways to make a trip active for the nature and for my body.
Iâ€™m not gonna lie it helped tremendously that over the summer I had two more or less back-to-back 8-day treks one in Kyrgyzstan and one in Alaska.
Alcohol I probably owe most of my previous weight gain to my drinking habits.
Now that I really think about it I was having at least one drink almost every day when I was traveling but usually more.
I havenâ€™t had any alcohol for over three months now but thatâ€™s another post entirely.
Spent three days canoeing â€“ a good workout in a gorgeous place! Apart from all of these things the biggest thing of all was knowing why I was doing it and why getting healthy was important apart from aesthetics.
I really wanted to be stronger.
There are a lot of sports that I love doing â€“ like through multi-day hiking where I am carrying roughly 30% of my body weight and diving where again I am carrying pretty heavy gear and recently pole dancing.
All of these things have a high potential of injuring me if I am not strong enough to do them.
The other thing is if I do not break up my work day by doing some exercise I tend to isolate myself too much and then I start feeling weird.
Feeling strong seeing results and feeling confident I also needed to work on my self-love.
Wow what a journey that has been! The Emotional Freedom Technique and Six Pillars of Self Esteem I mentioned here and the Life Coach I mentioned here have both been so helpful for that as was the decision to stop having alcohol which I promise to talk about in a later post.
It also helped to just start.
By taking healthy actions every day then I feel encouraged to take other healthy actions like going out for walks meeting up with people and being social or going to the damn grocery store and all of those other little things that should be normal activities but for me sometimes are difficult to do.
At this point I have lost the 15 or so pounds of fat that I was carrying around and gained a bit of it back in muscle.
Iâ€™m happy with where I am and my only goal is to keep getting healthier.
In the end I hope this is helpful because I really donâ€™t want this article to come from a place of everyone should be skinny everyone should look like me.
I donâ€™t like this perpetuation of the idea that only slim bodies are beautiful â€“ not that thereâ€™s anything wrong with that Iâ€™m predisposed to be skinny myself â€“ but itâ€™s just one out of many body shapes and sizes.

Reply Yasmine says 10/25/2017 at 938 am Daily meditation walk everywhere I can within reason to explore a city and Gaia.com for yoga and class videos.
I do these in the morning because it starts my day off really well.
And they have an offline player.
I also try to make my breakfasts oatmeal smoothie if possible and carry some cut veggies an apple or almonds in my purse.
Iâ€™m often at my happiest when travelling because Iâ€™m relaxed and it usually helps me better keep in a routine.
Thanks for this post! I love how you keep true to yourself and keep positive.
Reply GG says 10/24/2017 at 150 pm Hi Kristin.
Well put.
You effectively made the focus on a healthy you and not on looks.
Based on looking at the links you have provided the amount of reading you have done on these subjects and the common sense recommendations you make I can tell you that you have not only kept yourself healthier physically but have challenged and exercised your mind.
You are showing great wisdom and intelligence.
Health is holistic you are only as strong as your weakest point and you are trying to cover all the angles.
A healthy mind and body go hand in hand and so happy for you and your accomplishments.
Congrats on losing the weight the way you are doing it you will keep it off.
Funny thing is I am referring to the emotional weight as much as the physical.
Also funny is how so much of beauty shines from those who exude power love confidence and inner peace.
Being satisfied with how one looks and physical appearance is part of our nature but have been pushed too much to the forefront.
Feeling strong and empowered is more the ticket.
You are not kidding about the alcohol and weight that is low hanging fruit.
And I looked up pole dancing since not heard of that as an exercise and holy cow wow you must be getting pretty strong! I and others here should try that some time because I have trouble with standard weights for building muscle..
I am more a use your own body weight and stretches type of person I have to stretch a lot I am not flexible at all plus lots of running.
I wish I could say something to you about trolls to make you feel better about them but you seem to be handling it better than I would honestly if I were in your situation.
The only comment is one of scale it used to be there might be one jerk in a room or in a crowd.
Now with the world wide web we are in front of thousands and thousands of people the 0.001% can make some noise.
It will hurt what they say but you have become so much stronger than that.
Wonâ€™t be able to keep them away but what you are doing here puts them to shame.
As for my thoughts to contribute if you have covered any of these feel free to provide everyone a blue link to them  1.
I like using stretch bands color coded for how much tension.
You can do exercises anywhere with those just need something to wrap around.
It helped me regain my strength in my calf muscles my injured calf became bigger than my healthy one in a few months! Can be used for stretches and strengthening.
2.
Sleep How much sleep do you get Kristin? I imagine traveling being so active hiking would bring the need for extra of this.
However everyone has their circadian rhythm more into night than day need 9 versus 7.5 hours a night etc.
but as a person who has frequently tried to buy time and sleep deprive it isnâ€™t worth it and it is hard to break the habit.
This is one I am working on but this is vital to a healthy you.
In addition to length positioning is vital as so many injuries are a result of poor positioning.
Imagine posing for 7 hours while you are awake uncomfortably.
That is what many do in their sleep and wonder why they have a sudden jolt of pain in the middle of the following day.
Funny thing is I sleep really well when traveling versus at home and feel more in control.
3.
Posture Not really exercise but if you want to stay limber and strong as you get older this is very important for the back.
So any exercises that work on the posture are good.
I think though what you are doing Kristin covers this a lot so this may not count as an additional contribution! 4.
This might sound not so pleasant but another important healthy thing which you can avoid by not eating those not wholesomeâ€? carbs is regarding your digestive system.
Make sure to eat foods that avoid constipation.
Better to be slightly the other way if canâ€™t be just rightâ€?.
This is very hard to accomplish in traveling though! 5.Make sure to leave gaps between eating and exercise.
All the people in track and field I have dealt with seem to be so impatient with this and with waiting the necessary time to recover from injuries!.
Hope this stuff is helpful! Reply Laura says 10/25/2017 at 456 am I usually gain weight when in other countries because of the different food.
I cook all my meals myself but abroad I donâ€™t want to be rude and say no to food Iâ€™m invited to.
Itâ€™s already a balance act being a vegetarian / part-time vegan.
You inspired me to pay more attention on what I eat while travelling and to say no to things that donâ€™t make me feel good.
Reply Kristin says 10/25/2017 at 603 am So much respect for maintaining a vegetarian and vegan diet when abroad! Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™d like to lean more towards as well.
Reply Deborah says 10/25/2017 at 528 am Nice post with helpful information.
I think many people struggle with the same thing.
About the bodyshaming some people are just really stupid.
I love reading your posts en stories.love your personality.
All you can do is being true to yourself and be the best you can be and not worrying about the opinion of other people that arent dear to you.
Easily said i struggle every day with my weight ?  but iâ€™m getting better at it! Thatâ€™s the best of getting older! Reply Kristin says 10/25/2017 at 602 am SO TRUE â€“ the older I get the fewer fcks I give about anyone elseâ€™s opinion of my body.
Reply Ijana Loss says 10/25/2017 at 1230 pm Great post! Itâ€™s so hard to be healthy on the road.
I commend you for doing so well on improving it making changes like that is not easy and especially not while traveling.
I try and find a CrossFit box to drop into wherever I go but traveling is just begging for overindulgence.
The alcohol is a big one too Iâ€™ve been thinking I need to stop drinking it as well.
Iâ€™m living in Germany right now hey that makes two of us! and everyone loves beer here and Iâ€™ve kind of jumped on the wagon and perhaps need to tone it down a bit XD Reply Kristin says 10/26/2017 at 234 am Germany is also home to alkoholfrei beer! But I donâ€™t think itâ€™s all that delicious.
Cutting out alcohol has been really good for me in terms of my time being better spent now my money my body everything.
Reply Charlotte McGhee says 10/25/2017 at 451 pm Meditation! This is the thing that Iâ€™ve been hearing we should all do but it only clicked recently and Iâ€™m so grateful.
What a beautiful way to start your day and shut out the trolls! Huzzah for being healthy while traveling and always! Reply Kristin says 10/26/2017 at 232 am Same Iâ€™ve only forced myself to make it a daily thing recently and it changed everything.
Reply Elina says 10/26/2017 at 901 am I love your self-reflecting posts Kristin the whole reason Iâ€™m such a big fan of your blog is that youâ€™re not just doing 10 best things to do in whereverâ€? type of stuff.
I really like how you said an ideal body should be YOUR ideal body not something that someone or something else thinks is ideal â€“ I mean even if I did have the perfectâ€? body and someone told me that it wouldnâ€™t matter at all if it wasnâ€™t the body I was striving for.
Staying healthy on the road can be so damn difficult.
For me the biggest thing is that Iâ€™m missing my usual sports classes I hate the gym and that Iâ€™m eating sweets like every damn day just to get some energy and cope with travel stressâ€¦ But even with that I think travelling has actually helped me gain a better body image.
My body hasnâ€™t really changed much over the last few years just my attitude towards it.
Anyway thanks for writing about important semi-travel related stuff! Keep doing it please! Reply Kristin says 10/27/2017 at 1246 am Hi Elina thanks for the feedback! Iâ€™m glad you like these posts.
I try to cope with the stress more with the gratitude lists.
However truth be told I eat a lot of candy lately too! a girlâ€™s gotta live.
Reply Natalia says 10/28/2017 at 655 pm Walking is a must when I travel.
Where possible I explore places on foot sometimes armed with a good podcast.
You also see more that way! Reply c s says 10/31/2017 at 810 am When we travel I try to limit how much and what I eat.
At home I do low carb and I try to continue that abroad.
For breakfast I eat eggs and coffee and maybe a tiny bit of fruit with a small amount of plain yogurt for a treat.
I have had pastries in some countries and just have found they are not that good to me so I skip them.
I also donâ€™t eat lunch just breakfast and dinner.
Being in such beautiful places we walk constantly and I just donâ€™t think about food.
I did find one time when we travelled when I also ate lunch or large amounts of food then I did gain that time.
I donâ€™t drink as it makes me feel awful so that takes care of the issue for me.
Reply Kristin says 10/31/2017 at 155 pm Oh man I actually have to do the opposite â€“ I eat all throughout the day but small meals.
I get hangry otherwise! Reply Erica says 11/03/2017 at 947 am I got super excited when I read youâ€™ve started pole dancing! Iâ€™m glad to hear youâ€™re in love with it it tends to have an oddly healing effect on people.
Iâ€™ve been poleing for 4 years and I currently teach it at a studio just outside Toronto so if youâ€™re ever in Toronto and looking to get a practice inâ€¦..
ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 11/03/2017 at 337 pm Absolutely! Itâ€™s a new obsession for sure.
Just started doing twice per week.
I have never been this strong in my life Iâ€™m loving it! Reply Skyler says 11/12/2017 at 707 am Thanks for posting about this Kristin! Iâ€™ve been traveling 9 months now and while at first I saw myself thinning down from the daily active life that is travel vs sitting at my office desk all day youâ€™re 1000% right about the alcohol and eating.
Theyâ€™re starting to show.
Itâ€™s so tough when being social at hostels and meeting new friends because the bonding usually occurs over eating and drinking.
I just ordered a travel yoga mat and am trying to work on adding meditation into my daily life.
Because in the end itâ€™s really not about being skinny but instead about self care.
Itâ€™s not easy it requires effort that is totally worth it.
Thanks for giving me the encouragement I needed.
Keep kicking ass girl Skyler Reply Kristin says 11/12/2017 at 936 am Glad you connected with it Skyler! Yeah it can be hard with the pressures associated with hostel bonding being over drinks.
I wonder how itâ€™ll be when Iâ€™m back in hostels but abstaining.
Iâ€™m curious to see! Reply Brian says 11/12/2017 at 1222 pm Wow great post! Iâ€™m not on the road that much anymore but I wish I will be soon enough ð?™‚ Thanks for the tips they will surely come in handy for many people! Reply Erin says 02/06/2018 at 738 pm Really enjoyed your post! I have been following Cassie and blogilates for years! When I lived with my parents I would do her workout videos in my bedroom.
I donâ€™t do her workouts anymore but still follow her blog posts.
I found that what I truly enjoy the most is group fitness classes such as barre TRX spin as well as yoga.
To be honest I am super lazy and I would prefer to show up and do what Iâ€™m told as opposed to planning my own workout and having to think about it! Iâ€™m glad to hear that you have been learning to love yourself better and look forward to hearing about why you quit alcohol.
Reply Pearl Accountants says 07/21/2018 at 318 am Very nice.
Its a useful post with helpful information.
I think most of the people have got problem with the same thing.
thank you Kristin.
Reply Charlotte says 08/26/2018 at 407 am Great blogpost! I think your ass is perfectly fine.
ð?˜‰ Just discovered your blog and exploring all the articles and you are totally awesome for doing al those epic hikes! <3 Reply Kristin says 09/04/2018 at 156 pm Thank you! Much love.
Reply Goldie says 12/24/2018 at 118 am I love how she really shows us what she really eats healthy unlike other models claiming they eat pizza and junk food unhealthy which means that they properly had slice of pizza for the entire day or in other words starving themselves.ï»¿ Reply Jessica Hill says 12/29/2018 at 650 pm Nice post! Itâ€™s so hard to motivate yourself to keep healthy while traveling but if itâ€™s for longer periods of time then you have no choice but to establish SOME sort of routine right?! ð?˜‰ Reply Kristin says 12/29/2018 at 756 pm Thatâ€™s what I found! Reply Martina Baum says 10/16/2019 at 1032 pm This was such a good read.
Thanks for sharing this very important tips when traveling.
This helped a lot.
Reply travautood says 10/17/2019 at 119 am Travel beyond limits is something that is beyond someone imagination.
Itâ€™s sink or swim on the road.
You either get better at making friends or you end up alone crying each night into a pillow.
You learn to make friends out of strangers and get more comfortable talking to new people.
When I first started traveling I was kind of an introvert and uncomfortable talking to those I didnâ€™t know.
Now Iâ€™ll happily talk to strangers like weâ€™ve been best friends for years.
Travel not only makes you comfortable talking to strangers it makes you better at it too.
After talking to people all the time the same questions get boring.
You start to even bore yourself.
After a while you donâ€™t care about where people are from where they are going how long theyâ€™ve been traveling.
