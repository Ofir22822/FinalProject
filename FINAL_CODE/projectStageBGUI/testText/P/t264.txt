See our Editorial Policy and Privacy Policy for more info! A Brief Introduction to Train Travel in Thailand Trains are one of the most comfortable and enjoyable ways to get around Thailand.
Forget freezing in air conditioned sleeper buses that seem to think theyâ€™re transporting items that need to be frozen and instead sit back or lie back and watch the serene Thai country side roll past or read your book as an attendant comes and nicely folds down your bed for the night.
Travel by train in Thailand is low hassle high comfort especially on the brand new trains and one of the best ways to take in the contrasting scenery.
Plus itâ€™s the only way to be certain of skipping the traffic.
Thereâ€™s a certain air of nostalgia too about Thailandâ€™s railways Impossibly quaint signal boxes and station managersâ€™ offices rising above freshly swept platforms dotted with flower pots are the order of the day completed by a picture of the Thai royal family at every station.

I knew that when I returned in November last year that it wouldnâ€™t be long until Iâ€™d find myself back on the rails.
When it comes to Train Travel in Asia there are few countries where itâ€™s easier or more comfortable to travel by train the train journey over the river Kwai is unforgettable and the best way to travel between Chiang Mai to Bangkok is by train.
Weâ€™re not biased we promiseâ€¦ Yet unfortunately many travellers seem to be unaware of the options or have been tarred by experiences of being ripped off by unscrupulous travel agents.

Even better train tickets can now be bought online saving the hassle thanks to the ever helpful asian booking site â€“ 12go.asia â€“ get your tickets here.

I love falling asleep on sleeper trains.
I find that thereâ€™s something soothing about the motion of the train on the rails.
This journey from Chiang Mai to Bangkok is perfect for just that.
The Chiang Mai to Bangkok train journey takes around 12 hours if you take the express / super rapid option.
Thereâ€™s a choice of two express trains one leaving at 5pm and one leaving at 6pm from Chiang Mai.
There are also a couple of slower trains available that leave earlier in the day but these tend to arrive in Bangkok in the middle of the night and are older trains.
The express trains arrive in Bangkok at 05.25 and 06.25am respectively although both times that Iâ€™ve taken the train from Chaing Mai to Bangkok it was about an hour late.
Either way the length of the journey is perfect for getting a good amount of shut-eye! Time to relax and catch up on journalling! A few hours into the journey train staff come around and pull down the upper bunks convert the lower bunks and make-up the beds with clean linen.
Both times Iâ€™ve taken this train Iâ€™ve opted for second class sleeper so I canâ€™t attest to first class luxury but 2nd class has always been a wonderful experience for me.
Arriving into Bangkok in the early morning this time I was greeted with a ruby-red sunrise creeping through the gaps in-between skyscrapers and flyovers as we crawled into Bangkok.
Walking out into the early morning sunshine from Bangkokâ€™s Hualamphong station provides a rare chance to see the city in a cleaner early morning light after street life has already begun but before other travellers are up! Iâ€™d also enjoy doing the reverse journey taking the sleeper train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai where the early morning view is of the mountains and countryside houses surrounding Chiang Mai as opposed to the concrete jungle of Bangkok.

Classes of Travel Planning & Booking for Chiang Mai Bangkok Trains.
I recently read an account by another blogger whoâ€™d been scammed into buying two first class tickets at a huge markup so that she could have the first class sleeper compartment to herself and avoid sharing with an unknown maleâ€?.
A few points that will help avoid this sort of scam First class compartments â€“ if youâ€™re a solo traveller you may be paired up to share the compartment but only with someone of the same sexâ€”solo travellers of different genders will not be paired up by Thai Railways.
Most foreigners opt for second class air conditioned where there are no compartments but sleepers are open plan have privacy curtains and are very comfortable.
Train tickets open for booking a maximum of 60 days ahead.
Some companies may offer to book further out for you but they can only actually make the reservation when ticket sales are opened by Thai Railways 60 days in advance of travel.
Powered by 12Go Asia system Which Chiang Mai Bangkok Train Should I Take? There are several Chiang Mai to Bangkok day trains you can choose or three Chiang Mai to Bangkok Night trains.
There are also different classes of trains in Thailand from Rapid far from it to Special Express.
Train number 10 that departs at 6pm daily is the most popular and fastest train to Bangkok.
Thai Railways timetable courtesy railway.co.th Day Trains The day trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok generally use older rolling stick with cheaper sitting classes available that are fan / not air conditioned.
These options are perfect for those with time on their hands want to get the most of seeing the countryside or are after the best value seat.
These trains also take longer than the faster night trains taking up to 15 hours to run the journey with more frequent stops.
Day Train options include the 06.30 and the 08.50 departure from Chiang Mai.
As you can see from the Chiang Mai to Bangkok train timetable below only those wanting the truly scenic experience should take train number 102.
Night Trains Sleeper trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok leave daily at 15.30 17.00 and 18.00.
Train number 14 at 17.00 is a slightly older version of the 18.00 express while train number 52 at 15.30 is a slower older version again.
For those who want the chance to take photographs through an open window the 15.30 departure is a good bet â€“ train number 10 is fully air conditioned and has sealed windows and doors.
Where to book Train Tickets in Thailand.
If youâ€™re already in Thailandâ€¦by far the easiest option is to go and buy them yourself from the train station.
Remember to take your passport with you! From outside Thailand if you want to book ahead youâ€™ll need to use an agency.
The one we suggest is 12Go as recommended above who will offer you the option to collect your train tickets later in Thailand at a hotel or nearby major stations.
The same booking restrictions apply i.e.
maximum of 60 days out but they have a minimum of 3 days before travel for tickets to be booked.
Personally Iâ€™ve always booked my tickets in Thailand at the Station a week or two in advance.
Iâ€™ve never had a problem this way even on the busy Chiang Mai to Bangkok route.
Thai holidays and Chinese new year can get busy though so itâ€™s best not to leave buying tickets last minute or leave it until the day of travel.
At December 2016 the price for a 2nd class AC sleeper on the new express trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok was 881 Baht for a lower birth or 792 Baht for an upper birth upper births are slightly narrower and you donâ€™t get a window view ð?˜‰ .

Why Travel from Chiang Mai to Bangkok by Train? In short a few reasons.
Not only is train travel more environmentally friendly than flying I find it a lot more comfortable and efficient in terms of time as well.
Although the flight between Bangkok and Chiang Mai may be a short one add on the time to get to the airport at either end check in go through security etc and itâ€™s not so short after all.
With the train I save myself the cost of a hotel for the night and the hassle of security and getting to and from airports.
Being transported from city centre to city centre whilst I sleep is a pretty sweet deal.
These older trains are not used on the popular sleeper routes anymore so you wonâ€™t be on one of theseâ€¦ But thereâ€™s another reason.
For me train travel is also an opportunity to see more of the local culture.
Each time Iâ€™ve taken the Chiang Mai â€“ Bangkok train despite there being other foreigners around Iâ€™ve chatted with locals and got to be able to enjoy what is going on around me.
This doesnâ€™t happen on a plane.
The first time I ended up trying to have a conversation with a lady opposite me who spoke no English and I donâ€™t speak Thai! based on the language glossary in the Lonely Planet! The next time on the train to Trang a lady attending a business meeting in Bangkok invited me to stay with her.
After arrival in Bangkok â€“ views over the Chao Phraya River.
This time from Chiang Mai it felt like the whole train was full of social media fans or bloggers perhaps! who were focussed on making videos of the brand new train which runs on the Chiang Mai-Bangkok 6pm route.
Lastly travelling by train in Thailand is incredibly safe.
Iâ€™ve taken most of the sleeper trains in Thailand by myself and have never felt unsafe on any of them.
Heading to Thailand? Grab your Lonely Planet here! Frequently Asked Questions for Taking the Chiang Mai Train Which is the best Train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok? This depends on your point of view.
If you want the fastest most comfortable train then train 10 leaving at 18.00 daily is a good option â€“ but book tickets well ahead of time as this is also the most popular train to Bangkok.
For those with more time on their hands we recommend giving one of the day or part day trains a try which offer a more local way of travel and more time to enjoy the views.
How can I buy tickets for the Chiang Mai to Bangkok Train? If youâ€™re already in Thailand you can easily book tickets at any Thai Railways train station within 60 days of departure we recommend booking at least a few days ahead.
If youâ€™re not in Thailand yet and itâ€™s within 60 days of your journey we recommend booking your tickets online here.
Which is the Best Class of Travel? For a comfortable overnight journey we recommend booking Second Class Sleeper Air Conditioned which gets you your own berth upper or lower with privacy curtain that converts into a comfortable window seat during day time.
Upper berths are available at a slight discount compared to the slightly wider and more sought after lower berths.
When Should I book My Train Ticket from Chiang Mai to Bangkok? As soon as you can within 60 days of travel and preferably at least in advance.
If the sleeper trains are booked up there may still be tickets available for one of the day trains.

Totally agree with you one point of your article Thailand is one of the few Asian countries that has good train system.

Reply Hawaii Amanda April 13 2018 - 635 am I love the Thailand trains ! ð?™‚ I have used them over and over on my Thailand trips .
Reply Louis August 12 2018 - 814 am Iâ€™m on the day train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok.
Iâ€™m absolutely devastated that thereâ€™s no where to charge my stuff lol..
thereâ€™s plug sockets but none of them work ð?™? Thanks for the info though ð?™‚ Reply Ian August 23 2018 - 727 pm I have travelled on night trains twice in Thailand from Bangkok to Chiangmai and from Nong Kai to Bangkok.
In both cases they converted to seats to beds around 7 pm much to early in the evening in my opinion.
Admittedly the last time I did the trip was in 2006 maybe the policy has changed.
Reply peck December 2 2019 - 811 pm hi Ellie thanks for writing about training within Thailand.
Iâ€™m an asian who always travel to Bangkok but have not gone to other cities in Thailand.
So this time Iâ€™m planning to go Chiang Mai and Bangkok.
can i ask for your opinion as of which direction do you enjoy the most? or which direction do you think has the best view? Chiang Mai to Bangkok or vice versa? Reply Kim February 7 2020 - 909 pm Hi Ellie! Looks like you were traveling with just a backpack â€“ what is the luggage situation on this train? Thank you! Reply Ellie Cleary February 12 2020 - 917 pm Hi Kim thereâ€™s space under the seats to store your main backpack or suitcase and you can keep any valuables in your seat/on your berth with you.
Thereâ€™s space for a suitcase but travelling light is always easier.
