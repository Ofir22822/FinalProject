Sober in Southeast Asia An Impossible Mission? 03/11/2018 by Kristin 29 Comments I remember that afternoon in my Berlin apartment expressing to a friend of mine who also doesnâ€™t drink that I was afraid of going back to Southeast Asia as a solo traveler without being a drinker anymore.
It had been three years since Iâ€™d been back and I remembered it as quite the party place.
I tended to bond with people over Chang beers and in backpacker bars.
So many of the activities involved alcohol and I was afraid that Iâ€™d be the only non-drinker there.
He smiled and suggested that the reason why Iâ€™d thought of Southeast Asia as such a party place before is because that was the mode I was in at the time.
Youâ€™ll find the other non drinkers because this time youâ€™ll be looking for them and theyâ€™ll be looking for you.â€? I was skeptical but heâ€™d turn out to be right and this decision would lead me to the best travel experiences of my life.
Why no alcohol? Abridging it on the spiritual journey Iâ€™ve been on over the past few years Iâ€™ve been taking a harder look at the things that have kept me from being happy and at peace.
Hangovers always gave me anxiety and when I asked myself what positive contribution alcohol made to my life I couldnâ€™t think of anything.
Not one thing.
That made the decision clear though taking action hasnâ€™t always been easy.
I promise to talk more about that later but for now I just want to share the experience in Southeast Asia and why it was so worth it A different kind of approach Upon arriving back in Thailand I headed straight for a Vipassana retreat in Chiang Rai.
Iâ€™d done it once before and found it amazingly invigorating.
That meant five days the usual is ten but this one was shorter of complete silence meditating all waking hours of the day.
I turned off my technology didnâ€™t read rarely wrote and focused on being mindful.
I emerged from that recharged and empowered in my decision to do this trip sober.
At the retreat center New Life Foundation in Chiang Rai This set the tone for a much healthier month to follow spent adventuring around Thailandâ€™s hidden places in a car Iâ€™d rented with my assistant Ashley and my adventure tour partner Pete.
We never went to any backpacker places and alcohol never came up on the trip.
We were simply too busy having adventures! I loved this healthier approach.
I saw 28 out of 31 sunrises that month was surrounded by friendly Thai people in more remote places and otherwise was at a retreat where everyone else was sober too.
I was surrounded by spiritual and intentional people and that made it easy and enriching.
Sunrise #20 I knew that I had it easy.
I didnâ€™t have to work at being social with anyone since I already had a built in network.
However that was about to change.
In the solo months that followed in Indonesia I prepared myself for more challenges.
Feeling like an island Upon arriving in Indonesia I was on my own again.
It wasnâ€™t a huge deal since I joined a dive boat in Raja Ampat right away.
I was the only non-drinker on board and I did get asked why I wasnâ€™t drinking but Iâ€™m pretty used to that now.
A nice glass of wine a beer to close out the day or a shot of sake are ingrained in our respective cultures.
Itâ€™s considered strange to abstain though on the other side of it I wish more people would give it a try.
I didnâ€™t say that though I just said that I like life better this way and people were usually satisfied with that.
Thankfully nobody was getting wasted on board anyways because the point of the trip was diving.
I had a great time and this trip ranks in the top 5 of my life.
Was the only non drinker at the beach party but it didnâ€™t matter! After that I landed in Lombok and went straight to Kuta.
Thatâ€™s where it sank in that I was alone and my former methods for meeting people â€“ dorms and drinking â€“ were on the table for what felt like everyone but me.
I went to a few bars with people from my guesthouse but it just didnâ€™t feel right.
I felt like an island in a sea of people who had different objectives than I did.
I was trying to fit into a place Iâ€™d intentionally decided to part with.
I had a couple of lonely days but thankfully it didnâ€™t last for long.
The people I met It didnâ€™t take long for me to realize Iâ€™d just been looking in the wrong places.
I had to go out with more intention.
So I went to a yoga class and struck up a conversation with someone who looked interesting in a coffee shop in Kuta.
He turned out to be an amazing adventure buddy for the next few days there â€“ a spiritual person who also just wanted to experience the nature and beauty of Lombok.
Next I went to the Philippines and on my first day in Siquijor met a local who also meditates regularly and seeks spirituality.
We sang karaoke and swam in waterfalls in the days that followed.
I had amazing trip there too and as I sit here writing this I canâ€™t wait to see what the rest of the month of March brings.
My trip isnâ€™t over yet! Mermaiding in Indonesia I donâ€™t believe that itâ€™s by chance that I was led to these people and them to me.
I realized that by trusting by being open and by focusing on meeting the kind of people who I want to be meeting I put myself in situations where itâ€™s more likely to happen and the chances increased.
I also had an amazingly productive three months both on this blog and in my travels.
I had so much more time on my hands and to entertain myself I couldnâ€™t just fall back on happy hour drinks I had to go out and experience something.
Itâ€™s just not possible to see as much as I saw when sleeping off a hangover or drinking afternoon beers instead of afternoon exploration.
The sunrises were somehow brighter.
I noticed more things.
I was in the moment so much more and my mind was sharp.
Every morning that I woke up feeling good I knew I had made the right choice.
Itâ€™s my hope that by sharing this story it shows that itâ€™s possible to have an amazing travel experience without the crutch of alcohol or drugs.
Iâ€™m not here to try to convince anyone of anything or to demonize anyoneâ€™s lifestyle choices.
But maybe someone who reads this today will see exactly what they need to right now.
If thatâ€™s you I hope you know that better adventures await you than ever did before.

Comments GG says 03/11/2018 at 702 am More power to you Kristin.
I know personally that it must not have been easy for you and is a continuous battle.
But the rewards are tremendous.
You look great too both in your smiles of contentment and physically which are just a few of those.
Iâ€™ve been that island for many years and can attest to that personally.
Keep being the great role model you are nonjudgmental but making good judgments.
You have much support here on this.
Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 246 am Many thanks! The support has been amazing.
Reply Michelle says 03/12/2018 at 1216 am Iâ€™ve just returned from a 8 week trip to South East Asia and though it wasnâ€™t an entirely sober trip for me I unintentionally drunk far less than I expected to.
There were probably a bunch of reasons but i think itâ€™s mainly that Iâ€™m in my late 30s now and frankly I give less shits about trying to fit in hanging out in big groups or finding the party.
So I stayed in places I thought would suit me â€“ chilled hostels guesthouses and apartments that it seemed Iâ€™d enjoy communal areas but no bar decent bed free tea near to places Iâ€™d want to see rather than crazy nightlife.
Where I had to use a tour I chose the smaller group experience doing the things I liked rather than automatically picking the cheapest version.
I walked all day finding things that interested me and made me smile and having interactions that enriched my day.
I did activities that I enjoyed.
Lots of things required an early start.
Because of where I was spending my time met like-minded people of all ages from 18 to 67 who were more interested in local food markets sunrises experiences exploring a chat over tea finding a good cup of coffee even a good nightâ€™s sleep.
There was some booze for sure but there was no pressure and for each time I decided to have a beer I noticed there were at least equal numbers of people not drinking.
And so alcohol became largely irrelevant.
It was hot so cold water and fruit shakes were as common as beers in the places I chose to hang out.
I met more people who chose not to drink at all than Iâ€™d expected to â€“ either for economy or just becauseâ€¦ who knows? I didnâ€™t ask nor particularly care because more importantly it just wasnâ€™t an issue.
Some people drank others didnâ€™t the world went round and we all enjoyed our experience in the way we wanted to.
Incidentally my days and evenings were full despite not hitting the bars each night â€“ I didnt even read the books Iâ€™d hoped to finish! Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 242 am Thatâ€™s wonderful â€“ traveling with intention and meeting others who do as well! Reply Blair says 03/12/2018 at 429 am I love that you shared this.
I too am sober and I backpacked Southeast Asia for 4 months then 2 months in Mexico.
On these trips I had a friend so it wasnâ€™t bad or really tempting at all.
This past January and February however I went to Africa by myself and I was the only nondrinker around.
At first I was scared I wouldnâ€™t meet anyone or make any friends but that was absolutely not the case.
I loved every moment of it.
And waking up with no hangover I was able to see the sunrises and enjoy all of the amazing things and people that Africa has to offer and I want to go back and explore more.
It is definitely possible to travel sober even when there is such a big party scene.
You have a platform to share that experience where others will see itâ€™s possible so thank you.
Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 241 am I love no hangover too! I actually love going out dancing as well just with way less frequency and for the purpose of enjoying the music.
So glad you had fun in Africa and itâ€™s nice to know it worked out well for you out there too.
Reply Geoff says 03/12/2018 at 451 am I enjoy reading your adventures and am reading this over a Chang in Chiang Mai.
One thing I cannot understand though is why it has to be either one extreme or the other all or nothing drunk or teetotal? Why not just drink or not appropriately for the occasion? Or is it a lack of self control? Which I find hard to believe in your case.
Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 231 am To answer it simply for me thereâ€™s no such thing as just one like a potato chip.
Itâ€™s not about self control at all actually.
For someone who needs to be one extreme or the other it never was about self control to begin with although thatâ€™s often misunderstood.
I believe my body just reacts differently to the substance and I donâ€™t get that satisfied feeling from one that a lot of people do.
I canâ€™t wrap my head around the point of just one so for me it makes sense to do zero.
I will go into more detail in the future but thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m comfortable sharing right now.
Reply RaeAnne says 03/12/2018 at 203 pm Hi Kristin I have never traveled alone especially to another country itâ€™s a little bit intimidating! I think itâ€™s absolutly amazing that you have had so many solo adventures!! Itâ€™s very inspiring thanks for sharing!! Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 224 am Aw thanks! I understand that it can be intimidating and it is sometimes a bit more of a challenge â€“ then again so is traveling with others at times.
Itâ€™s led me to my best adventures.
Reply Kristen says 03/18/2018 at 908 am Thank you so much for sharing! I decided to give up drinking this year as I began realizing that alcohol made me feel worse hangover or not rather than better.
Also I enjoy experiences more being sober and fully present.
I havenâ€™t yet taken my sobriety on the road but I have wondered how that will pan out on my next trip as Iâ€™m a fairly reserved person and would use alcohol as the gateway to letting my guard down.
I really look forward to reading more on your experiences with sobriety.
Thank you for the continued inspiration! ? Reply Kristin says 03/18/2018 at 540 pm I think a lot of people find alcohol helps them come out of their shell but the truth is that was always you in there and the longer you become comfortable as the sober you the less youâ€™ll feel like thatâ€™s a necessary crutch.
You can still go out to bars and everyone else who is drinking will be more relaxed and talkative and maybe youâ€™ll find thatâ€™s enough for you too! Reply Gina says 03/18/2018 at 154 pm Keep on keeping on sister! You inspire! From your can do- I AM WOMAN HESR ME ROAR- attitude to the pics and your candidness YOU inspire! I have commented on your Instagram @thatmtgirl about my journey- BLAST OFF June 14 2018 to foreverâ€¦.I will be embarking on another solo female adventure single sober and enthusiastic! Last time I traveled through Europe I was in my 20â€™s and in the party mode.
Quite different this time and canâ€™t wait to embrace and be immersed in The cultural aide I missed before!!!! Not many get the 2nd chanceâ€? and I will embrace not waste!!!! Safe journeys fellow wanderlust junkie! Thatnka for the inspiration! Reply Kristin says 03/18/2018 at 538 pm I love that.
Not many do get that second chance and I can say that when youâ€™re not in party mode you actually SEE it for what it is and itâ€™s so much better this way! Reply Taylor says 03/19/2018 at 1204 am It was awesome to read this as someone who has just given up booze 3 weeks ago.
It feels amazing that I donâ€™t crave it and helps that I have a roommate who doesnâ€™t drink either but I do sometimes feel the pressure when out to have a beer in my hand as it still feels like a habit.
Iâ€™m also living in canggu so drinking is pretty common! Thanks for writing this up and best of travels! Reply Kristin says 03/19/2018 at 713 pm Go for a soda water instead! Still bubbly but no sugar ð?™‚ Reply Ilona says 03/19/2018 at 931 am This is a very inspiring post.
I do not like to drink much mostly because I donâ€™t enjoy the taste of alcohol and I donâ€™t see the point in drinking something that tastes awful to me.
There are some exceptions and a couple of drinks I had that I really enjoyed but mostly I stay sober.
I have never had problems meeting people on my travels despite rarely joining in parties and pub crawls.
I think I have made the same experience as you.
I might not meet the party crowd but I make great connections and come across like-minded people who enjoy the same things I do.
That retreat you wrote about sounds very interesting.
I think I would love to join something similar one day.
Maybe something where I could also do some yoga or other physical activities meditate and just have a few peaceful days.
It is definitely high on my list.
I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in Southeast Asia! Reply Kristin says 03/19/2018 at 708 pm Youâ€™d probably love New Life then.
They have all of that! I do find that I make fewer connections now but the ones that I do make are powerful.
Itâ€™s been quality over quantity and I donâ€™t have that feeling I did before that traveling resulted in friendships that were mostly skin-deep.
Itâ€™s been like night and day.
Reply Brianna says 03/21/2018 at 154 pm Iâ€™m also not big on drinking.
I just canâ€™t stand the taste of alcohol! One of the reasons Iâ€™ve been a bit hesitant to travel to SE Asia is because of its reputation as a drunken party destination.
Itâ€™s great to read your perspective on this matter and see that you can still enjoy this area without having to wear beer goggles the whole time! Reply Kristin says 03/21/2018 at 852 pm Totally I came to find itâ€™s just the experiences you seek and the people too.
You can find your tribe.
Reply Emily Harper says 03/27/2018 at 1059 pm Hi Kristin Though I am not a big drinker I want to challenge myself to turn off my phone or to stop checking my emails and be one with nature.
That is a great approach and itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always wanted to do.
ð?™‚ Reply Kristin says 03/30/2018 at 823 pm Yes itâ€™s another addiction a lot of people have to social media and technology! Reply Jenna Moor says 02/17/2019 at 509 pm I would love to do one of these kinds of retreats please email me some links! Thanks! Reply Cassie McCabe says 03/09/2019 at 1052 pm Thanks for this post! Iâ€™ve been traveling and drinking for the last 10 years.
Almost 5 months sober and although Iâ€™ve been on one trip it was with another sober friend.
I canâ€™t imagine the hostel/backpacker life sober.
This was encouraging and inspiring.
Reply Kristin says 03/13/2019 at 1150 am Yay.
Stay strong! 5 months is huge! Reply Bill Winn says 04/03/2019 at 626 pm Aloha Kristin almost a year has come to passâ€¦so on the 25th of April it will be 26 yrs! Last yrs Meeting in The Amazonâ€? will be a tough act to follow! Lol! Your business seems to be booming & i am still handing out copies of Your book to young people I meet.
Just for the record I was traveling to Boston back in late September of last yr on the lay over in Seattle I saw a face I thought I recognized.
And then she was gone with a mass of peopleâ€¦two hrs later I was about to board my flight & across the hall I see this gal again?! So i get up & head towards this Young Lady half way there I realize itâ€™s Jaguar Jenâ€? from the Peru Trip Your 1st trip.
So I shout out Hey Jaguarâ€? & her head snapped around so fast! Jaguar was her spirit animal WE all chose one at the Hotel in Cusco long story short Delta screw up her flight to up state NY so they put her on aflight to Boston one seat in front of me.
She might have been returning home after Your Alaska trip.
It was a grand flight We had breakfast at Login Airport Boston & went Our separate ways.
It is a small world Kristin & with some luck Our will cross paths again.
And i am thrilled life is treating You so well.
I little long winded but Happy Trails You Lady! Best=BillWinn P.S.â€”hey that cracks me up.
Reply Kristin says 04/04/2019 at 141 pm Aw so cool that you saw Jenn! Glad you guys got to have breakfast together.
It truly is a small world.
Congrats on 26 years BillWinn Reply Dan S says 01/07/2020 at 1028 pm Hi Kristin So this post just saved me.
I am a 36-yo recovering individual 4 years at the end of this month from northern NJ and decided that a soul-o backpacking trip was very much in order as both a college graduation present to myself before I start grad school and a continuation of the journey.
Thailand originally appeared on my bucket list for VERY different reasons than the ones that keep it there today.
So even though Iâ€™m not worried about my choices going there I was apprehensive about the crowds Iâ€™d be surrounded in or the isolation Iâ€™d feel being apart from the majority.
Iâ€™m very much looking to experience the type of trip you were discussing.
Iâ€™ll be starting with diving in Koh Tao in May and plan on doing a abbreviated banana pancake trail which routes me through N Thailand to Laos for the bulk of my trip and then flying to my other stops Vietnam and Cambodia and eventually drops me in Bangkok in July.
If you have other suggestions on stops experiences lodging Iâ€™d be thrilled to get your perspective.
You really just replaced all my fears with joy and hope and if youâ€™re like me thatâ€™s a tremendous gift.
Thank you so much for being the experience strength and hope I needed Sincerely Dan Reply Kristin says 01/08/2020 at 552 am Hey Dan so glad you found what you needed! I love places where a sport or spirituality is part of the reason why people visit.
Then partying isnâ€™t on the docket as much.
Iâ€™d pick places with some kind of activity youâ€™re excited about and other people are likely to go for the same reason.
