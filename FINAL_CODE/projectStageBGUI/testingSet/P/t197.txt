Welcome to Iceland.
Itâ€™s a destination unlike any other in Europe.
Its unique landscapes and natural wonders perfectly complement the modern capital of Reykjavik with its cafÃ© culture and boozy rambunctious nightlife.
Iceland is known as both the Land of Elves and the Land of Fire and Ice.
Itâ€™s a country where youâ€™ll find smoldering active volcanoes and vivid blue glaciers side by side.
Horses and sheep dot the countryside colorful puffins flock along the cliffs and whales breach the choppy Atlantic waters that envelop this tiny island.
Itâ€™s easy to see why Iceland has become such a popular destination in recent years all those cheap stopover flights have helped greatly too.
And while itâ€™s not the most budget-friendly country in the world there are still ways to see the sights without breaking the bank! If youâ€™re planning a weekend getaway or want to drive the entirety of the island this list of Iceland itineraries will ensure that you see the best the country has to offer! Table of Contents One Weekend in Reykjavik Four Days in the South Four Days in the North One Week Golden Circle and Southern Iceland Two Weeks Exploring the Ring Road One Month Everything! What to See and Do in Iceland One Weekend in Reykjavik Day 1 Take a tour of the city I always like to start my trips with a free walking tour.
Theyâ€™re a fantastic way to see a destination learn about its history and culture and get all your questions answered by someone who knows what theyâ€™re talking about.
City Walk and Free Walking Tour Reykjavik both offer great free tours of the city.
Theyâ€™ll help you get a sense of Reykjavik so you can decide what you want to revisit later.
The tours are donation based so just make sure to tip your guide! Explore Laugavegur When youâ€™re in need of a coffee or snack go for a stroll down Laugavegur a shop- and cafÃ©-lined street in the center of the city.
This is the oldest and coolest street in Iceland and youâ€™ll find everything from expensive couture to dollar stores here.
Be sure to stop in a bakery for a pastry or a coffee.
My personal favorite is Mokka Kaffi.
Visit a museum After that make your way to the National Museum of Iceland where you will learn everything you need to know about this tiny Nordic nation.
The most famous piece in the collection is the ValÃ¾jÃ³fsstaÃ°ur door a piece carved in the Middle Ages that illustrates the saga of the lion and the knight.
The museum does a fantastic job of giving you a robust history of the country without being boring.
If youâ€™d rather visit a more unconventional museum consider a visit to the Icelandic Phallological Museum instead.
Colloquially known as the Penis Museum this small institution is home to the worldâ€™s largest collection of penises and penis-themed art.
Yes you read that right! There are almost 300 items in the museum including whale penises and allegedly troll penises! Itâ€™s a small museum but itâ€™s actually incredibly informative â€” if youâ€™re not too shy! National Museum SuÃ°urgata 41 +354 530-2200 thjodminjasafn.is.
Open daily 10am-5pm closed on Mondays in the winter.

Icelandic Phallological Museum Laugavegur 116 +354 561-6663 phallus.is/en.
Open daily 10am-6pm.
Admission is 1700 ISK per person.
Go for a swim Once youâ€™ve gotten tired of walking go for a refreshing swim in the Laugardalslaug Geothermal Pool.
Swimming and saunas are how locals relax and unwind after work.
Itâ€™s basically a national pastime.
This pool is Icelandâ€™s largest and was built in 1968.
Itâ€™s actually a whole complex with hot tubs a thermal steam bath a waterslide and even mini golf! If you have extra time check out the nearby garden and zoo too.
Sundlaugavegur 105 +354 411-5100 reykjavik.is/stadir/laugardalslaug.
Open weekdays 630am-10pm and weekends 8am-10pm.
Admission is 625 ISK though if you have the Reykjavik City Card itâ€™s free! Take in the nightlife End your day enjoying the cityâ€™s famous nightlife back around Laugavegur.
This is one of the best party cities in the world so thereâ€™s something for everyone.
Just make sure to go during happy hour so you donâ€™t blow your budget alcohol in Iceland is not cheap!.
Here are a couple of my favorite hotspots in Reykjavik Kaffibarinn â€“ This cafÃ© transforms into a dance club on the weekend and itâ€™s a great place to party.
The space is divided into three different sections bar dance floor and lounge so you can find a section for however you want to spend your night out.
Itâ€™s small so seats can fill up quickly.
BergstaÃ°astrÃ¦ti 1 +354 551-1588 kaffibarinn.is.
Lebowski Bar â€“ Yes this is a Big Lebowskiâ€“themed bar.
The inside looks like a vintage American diner and bowling alley.
And since The Dude drinks a lot of White Russians its menu includes a wide variety of different ones.
Its signature Lebowski cheeseburger is pretty good too.
Spin the prize wheel to win up to 10 free beers! Aim for happy hour which is held daily 4pmâ€“7pm as drinks are cheaper then.
Laugavegur 20b +354 552-2300 lebowskibar.is.
Slippbarinn â€” This is the first proper cocktail bar in the city and boasts live music and DJs several nights a week.
Happy hour is daily 3pm-6pm.
Myragata 2 +354 560 8080 slippbarinn.is.
Where to stay in Reykjavik Hlemmur Square â€“ If youâ€™re looking to splash out this is both a cozy hotel and an upscale hostel so you have options for your type of stay.
Thereâ€™s a great bar here plus traditional Icelandic communal dinners several times a week.
For a more standard hostel stay at Kex Hostel.
It has a cafÃ© and bar with an awesome happy hour a comfy lounge and a heated patio.
Day 2 Explore the Golden Circle The Golden Circle â€” comprising the Gullfoss waterfall the Strokkur geyser and Ã?ingvellir National Park â€” is the biggest tourist draw in Iceland so youâ€™ll want to start your second day early and head out of town in a rental car or on a tourist bus.
As tourism booms in Iceland these sites can get a little crowded so make sure you get there early especially in the summer and on weekends.
The round-trip journey is around 250km so plan accordingly when it comes to food and fuel if youâ€™re driving.
If youâ€™re driving youâ€™ll also be able to stop regularly to see the many Icelandic horses that youâ€™ll pass by.
Experience the famous Blue Lagoon This is one of the most iconic destinations in Iceland.
The pools are quite large and the whole area is steamy with the water a stunning milky-blue color that is rather photogenic which is why the lagoon is so popular on social media.
Itâ€™s a beautiful and luxurious way to end the day and a great place to relax right before you depart.
Personally I think the place is a bit overhyped as there are tons of free secluded hot springs all around the country.
Of course if youâ€™re short on time and donâ€™t plan on leaving the city then itâ€™s the perfect way to end your trip! Fun fact The Blue Lagoon is simply runoff from the nearby geothermal plant.
Icelanders just found a way to monetize it for tourists! Thank you Instagram? Ha! NorÃ°urljÃ³savegur 9 +354 420-8800 bluelagoon.com.
Open daily but hours vary so check the website for an up-to-date schedule.
Admission starts at 9990 ISK per person but it can be cheaper if you go during certain hours.
READ MORE How to save money in Reykjavik What to See and Do in Iceland Four Days in the South In addition to the itinerary above here are some activities youâ€™ll want to add if you plan on getting further outside of Reykjavik to explore the southern region of Iceland.
Day 3 Experience nature Head southeast on the Ring Road from ReykjavÃ­k to scout out some waterfalls.
Be prepared and bring swimsuits towels a waterproof camera and a jacket.
Reykjadalur â€“ Stop in the town of HveragerÃ°i to visit the Reykjadalur hot spring or hot pot as they are known locally.
It offers a gorgeous backdrop of rolling hills and mountains and itâ€™s free to enjoy.
Youâ€™ll need to hike a bit to get there 30-40 minutes but itâ€™s worth it! Keep in mind that thereâ€™s not a private changing area here so you may want to wear your swimsuit under your clothes.
Seljalandsfoss â€“ Continuing on the Ring Road youâ€™ll come to the picturesque Seljalandsfoss waterfall.
It has a drop of 60m and is another highly photographed spot in Iceland so try to get there early before the tourist buses.
You have to pay for parking but otherwise itâ€™s free.
If youâ€™re hungry thereâ€™s a food vendor that sells delicious lamb stew among other things.
SkÃ³gafoss â€“ Another epic waterfall is SkÃ³gafoss.
Legend says that you can find a treasure chest behind this massive waterfall.
This is also the starting point for a long multi-day hike but you can also just climb to the top and walk for as long as youâ€™d like before returning.
Thereâ€™s a small museum nearby as well if you want to learn more about the history of the waterfall.
Seljavallalaug â€“ This hot pot is located a short walk off the Ring Road.
Itâ€™s not super hot and the change room has seen better days but itâ€™s secluded and itâ€™s worth it just for the scenery as its located at the bottom of a deep valley.
Make Your way to VÃ­k Head to the charming little town of VÃ­k and spend the night there.
VÃ­k is a seaside village with a glacier that covers the Katla volcano.
Itâ€™s also home to some amazing black sand beaches and a DC-3 plane wreck in SÃ³lheimasandur located on the coast between SkÃ³gafoss and VÃ­k.
Where to stay in VÃ­k VÃ­k HI Hostel â€“ This charming hostel has a cafÃ©/bar a female-only dorm rooms for families and a kitchen so you can cook your own food if youâ€™re on a budget.
Day 4 Chill at the beach Wake up in VÃ­k and go for a stroll on the otherworldly Reynisfjara black sand beach.
There are some offshore rock formations you can see from the shore and from the cliffs above if you feel like a hike.
If youâ€™re here from May through August you may even get to see some puffins! Take in the view If thereâ€™s time head up the hill to see the small VÃ­k i Myrdal Church.
It overlooks the town and gives a complete view of VÃ­k and the ocean.
Grab a coffee at a local cafÃ© and enjoy the scenic vista.
Head for home Head back to Reykjavik.
See more sights chill in more cafÃ©s.
Do whatever you want before you head home! sad What to See and Do in Iceland Four Days in the North If you want to get away from the crowds go north.
Northern Iceland is one of the least-visited regions of the country and has a lot to offer the intrepid adventurer including majestic hikes more varied landscapes whale watching fewer people and a better chance to see the Northern Lights! Day 1 Travel north to Akureyri Start your adventure off by flying north to Akureyri from Reykjavik.
If you donâ€™t want to fly itâ€™s a 5-6-hour drive from Reykjavik up the west coast which can easily be done in a day.
Youâ€™ll just want to factor in a few stops along the way to sightsee! Explore Akureyri Take a self-guided tour of the town visit the Akureyri Botanical Gardens get an espresso from the picturesque Laut CafÃ© hop in the local swimming pool or just explore the relatively small town and sip on some kaffi coffee and happy marriage cakeâ€? rhubarb jamâ€“filled pastry with a buttery oat crust from KristjÃ¡nsbakarÃ­.
Soak up local life as much as you can before you go! Where to stay in Akureyri Akureyri Backpackers â€“ This is a laid-back hostel with a cool bar great staff and really hot showers! Day 2 Visit the Waterfall of the Gods Make your way to GoÃ°afoss the Waterfall of the Gods.
Itâ€™s a majestic semicircular waterfall thatâ€™s close to Akureyri on the Ring Road.
The waterfall is over 12m tall and 30m wide and not surprisingly is highly photogenic! Enjoy the view before heading onward to MÃ½vatn.
Head to MÃ½vatn Spend the day in MÃ½vatn starting off with a hike around Lake MÃ½vatn.
There is an easy trail you can follow that lets you stretch your legs and enjoy the natural beauty of the region.
You can easily hike the lake in a few hours if you go at a leisurely place.
Then head to the MÃ½vatn Nature Baths geothermal pool which is much quieter and cheaper than the Blue Lagoon.
Thereâ€™s not much else to do here.
Itâ€™s a quiet town for relaxing but the lack of lights makes it a wonderful place to see the northern lights! Spend the night in MÃ½vatn at one of the many Airbnbs guesthouses or farm stays in the region.
Day 3 Pretend youâ€™re on Mars Next youâ€™ll want to head toward the coastal town of HÃºsavÃ­k.
On your way there stop at Hverir and Krafla two geothermal areas with Martian-like craters and lakes.
Steaming sulfur fills the air giving this whole area an otherworldly ambience.
You can just stop to take photos or go for another hike.
Visit Dettifoss Next head to Dettifoss Europeâ€™s most powerful waterfall.
There are two roads leading here from the Ring Road 862 and 864.
The latter is ridden with potholes but in my opinion offers the better view.
Just drive slowly and keep an eye on your tires! Enjoy a snack by the waterfall and take in the scene.
When youâ€™re ready drive to HÃºsavÃ­k you can take the 864 north from Dettifoss.
Visit the Whale Museum Whaling has been a part of Icelandic culture for centuries.
And while there is a global moratorium on hunting whales itâ€™s still worth learning about these massive creatures their habitat and their impact on the country.
They also have a full blue whale skeleton! HafnarstÃ©tt 1 +354 414-2800 hvalasafn.is/en.
Open daily with hours varying depending on the season.
Admission is 2000 ISK per person with discounts available for seniors families and kids.
If you go whale-watching with Gentle Giants youâ€™ll get 20% off your museum ticket.
Where to stay Spend the night in sleepy HÃºsavÃ­k at a local guesthouse or Airbnb.
If itâ€™s northern lights season stay at Arbot HI Hostel.
The hostel is in a relatively secluded spot outside of town so youâ€™ll have a great view of the dancing lights without having to worry about light pollution.
Day 4 Watch the whales and explore the coast Wake up early head to the coast and go whale-watching.
There are a few different companies you can book tours with here including Gentle Giants who have a partnership with the Whale Museum see above.
Whale-watching tours usually last around 3 hours.
Expect to pay around 10400 ISK for adults and 4400 ISK for children.
When youâ€™re done explore the hiking trails around HÃºsavÃ­k.
You can find a list of the trails on the Visit HÃºsavÃ­k website.
Pop into some of the local shops and cafÃ©s to get a sense of small-town life here in Northern Iceland.
See some unique architecture Travel to nearby LaufÃ¡s which is located west of HÃºsavÃ­k.
Here youâ€™ll get to see the old turf houses traditional Icelandic homes that are timber framed and covered in grass.
The furnishings are from around 1900 and youâ€™ll feel like youâ€™ve traveled back in time.
While in LaufÃ¡s take a small detour and check out the church.
Inside is a decorative pulpit from 1698! Have an Icelandic feast Go back to Akureyri to explore the city and dine on fresh fish and chips from Akureyri Fish & Chips.
Donâ€™t forget to sample the countryâ€™s famous ice cream from Brynja too! Note I know it sounds like a lot but if you have a car this itinerary is very doable.
What to Do In One Week in Iceland Golden Circle and Southern Iceland Day 1-2 Head East Fly into KeflavÃ­k International Airport and rent a car SAD Cars and Car Rental Iceland are the companies I recommend.
Head east from ReykjavÃ­k along the Ring Road to start your adventure! Soak in the hot springs and search for puffins Head east for a soak in the Reykjadalur hot springs in HveragerÃ°i.
Camp or stay at the hostel nearby so you can get another soak in before heading onward.
To get a bit off the beaten trail take the ferry to the Westman Islands for the afternoon or an overnight stay youâ€™ll find plenty of puffins here during the summer season!.
There are very few tourists here so itâ€™s a nice way to escape the crowds and relax.
Chase some waterfalls Venturing onward along the Ring Road head to Seljalandsfoss and SkÃ³gafoss waterfalls.
At SkÃ³gafoss the 29km FimmvÃ¶rÃ°uhÃ¡ls Trail begins.
If you want to hike the entire trail you can stay at the Volcano Huts at the end of the route and then take a bus back to SkÃ³gafoss in the morning.
If youâ€™re fit you can do this hike in a day.
Otherwise youâ€™ll need to bring tents and camp halfway.
If an epic hike isnâ€™t in the cards stroll around the area before continuing east toward VÃ­k.
Tour a crash site Before you get to VÃ­k youâ€™ll want to check out the DC-3 plane wreck in SÃ³lheimasandur.
Itâ€™s about a 45-minute walk from the Ring Road but itâ€™s worth it to see the crash up close you can no longer drive directly to the site.
Dress appropriately as it can get windy near the coastline.
Spot puffins Continue on to VÃ­k and stop to see the black sand beaches.
There are also two short hikes nearby that take you up the cliffs.
They offer incredible views of the areas and if itâ€™s the right season you can go puffin spotting! Where to stay For your first night stay at the Hot Springs Hostel in HveragerÃ°i right near the hot spring.
That way you can wake up early and go for another soak before you leave.
If youâ€™re on the Westman Islands stay at Aska Hostel or book one of the many private guesthouses for a cozy local experience.
When you get to Vik stay at VÃ­k HI Hostel.
Days 3-4 Hike FjaÃ°rÃ¡rgljÃºfur Canyon This 2km-long canyon dates back to the Ice Age.
Itâ€™s over 100m deep and makes for a great place to hike or have a picnic and enjoy the view.
The road to get there is full of potholes so drive carefully.
Explore VatnajÃ¶kull National Park Hike in the Skaftafell wilderness area to see the glaciers of VatnajÃ¶kull National Park.
There are plenty of hikes here both long and short for outdoorsy types.
For a shorter hike head to Svartifoss another photogenic waterfall surrounded by long columns of black basalt the waterfallâ€™s name literally translates to the black waterfallâ€?.
KlapparstÃ­gur 25-27 +354 575-8400 vatnajokulsthjodgardur.is.
The park itself is open 24/7 however the Skaftafell visitors center has limited hours usually 9am-7pm in the summer and 10am-6pm in the winter.
See the website for more details including camping information and weather updates.
Parking is 750 ISK per vehicle per day.
Visit JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n Lagoon The JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n Glacier Lagoon borders the national park and you donâ€™t want to miss it.
The waters are blue and there are huge icebergs from the nearby glacier floating in the water.
The lagoon flows into the Atlantic Ocean and youâ€™ll see lots of seals in the winter.
You can follow the stream out to sea and watch the glaciers as they meet the ocean.
Best of all this is right on the Ring Road and itâ€™s all completely free though if you want to take a boat out into the lagoon youâ€™ll have to pay â€” I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth doing though! Tour the coast Continue on the Ring Road to HÃ¶fn or DjÃºpivogur two tiny coastal towns.
Get a taste of what life is like in small-town Iceland while exploring the winding coastline.
Thereâ€™s a hidden hot spring outside of DjÃºpivogur to reward you for making it so far up the coast too! Where to stay If youâ€™re ending your day in HÃ¶fn stay at HÃ¶fn Hostel.
You can see the VatnajÃ¶kull Glacier from the town and everything is within walking distance.
If youâ€™re heading on to DjÃºpivogur Airbnb will be your best choice.
Days 5-7 Return to ReykjavÃ­k Hop in the car and head back to the capital city.
Stroll the cozy streets take a free walking tour and enjoy some of the cityâ€™s plentiful happy hours.
See the Golden Circle Wake up early and drive out to see the three main sites of the Golden Circle.
The sooner you start the better as youâ€™ll be able to beat the tourist buses there and get some photos without the crowds.
Youâ€™ll also have time to hike in Ã?ingvellir National Park if you want to stretch your legs.
Stock up on snacks for the day in Reykjavik to save some money the cheapest supermarket is Bonus so shop there!.
Relax at the Blue Lagoon If youâ€™re craving another dip in a hot pot head to the Blue Lagoon before your flight home.
Youâ€™ll be able to end the trip on a very relaxing note! Two Weeks Exploring the Ring Road With two weeks you will be able to drive the entire Ring Road without rushing too much.
Youâ€™ll have time to enjoy the rugged east coast and places like Seydisfjordur explore the second-largest city Akureyri hike around the SnÃ¦fellsnes peninsula and maybe even dip into the Westfjords.
Start in Rekyavik head east see Seljalandsfoss and SkÃ³gafoss explore VÃ­k visit the JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n Lagoon detour over to SeyÃ°isfjÃ¶rÃ°ur then head over to Dettifoss MÃ½vatn GoÃ°afoss and Akureyri.
After exploring Akureyri continue west to the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula for some hiking.
Make sure you stop off to see the iconic Kirkjufell mountain which is one of the most photographed spots in all of Iceland plus itâ€™s where they filmed some Game of Thrones scenes too.
SnÃ¦fellsnes National Park is home to SnÃ¦fellsjÃ¶kull a 700000-year-old volcano capped by glaciers.
You can book a glacier hike here or just explore the rest of the park on your own.
Itâ€™s right along the coast too so youâ€™ll be met with some gorgeous views.
Stay at The Freezer hostel it has great live music.
If you have time and want to get off the beaten trail detour into the Westfjords in the northwest or visit the Westman Islands off the south coast.
If you want to be more focused on your trip you can split Iceland up into smaller geographic areas.
One fun route to take is to head west to the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula then up into the Westfjords for some hiking and relaxing before flying back to the capital.
This will be the most remote part of the country so youâ€™ll have a lot more space and privacy to enjoy your trip.
One Month Exploring All of Iceland With one month you can see the entire island of Iceland.
Iâ€™ve met quite a few people who have decided to spend this amount of time in the summer months.
Theyâ€™ll rent a car or camper van pack a bunch of camping gear and drive the Ring Road at a leisurely pace.
But even if you arenâ€™t renting a van or car you can get around by bus air or hitchhike! Take multi-day hikes visit to the less-explored Westfjords an area many tourists skip due to a lack of time and paved roads visit HrÃ­sey and/or GrÃ­msey the very remote islands in the north with fewer than 100 inhabitants each or the Westman Islands or explore more parks in the interior of the country itâ€™s very remote very unvisited and very very awesome.
If youâ€™re traveling on a shoestring budget and planning to camp and hitchhike in Iceland youâ€™ll need this longer travel time to make sure you arenâ€™t rushed as sometimes youâ€™ll be waiting awhile for a lift.
But with a month here thereâ€™s very little you canâ€™t explore! *** Iceland really does have something for everyone.
Whether youâ€™re visiting for a weekend or spending an entire month exploring this rugged landscape youâ€™ll be able to have an amazing experience.
