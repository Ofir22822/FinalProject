Itâ€™s often considered one of the most haunted cities in the entire world â€” and anyone who has been will be hard pressed to argue! When I was there a few years ago I took part in some of the cityâ€™s many ghost tours.
And there are a lot to choose from! Regardless of whether you believe in ghosts or not these tours take you on an adventure that not only teaches you a part of Edinburghâ€™s history but also leaves you feeling just a little weird.â€? Or if you are like me scared shitless.
While I hate horror movies because I always find them too unbelievable as Alfred Hitchcock said a good fright comes from what people donâ€™t see or know.
When I finished my ghost tours I was so spooked that I refused to sleep with the light off that night.
The only other time I felt such unease was after I saw The Blair Witch Project.
Whether youâ€™re looking for a fright or just want to learn about this historic cityâ€™s spooky past youâ€™ll definitely want to take a ghost tour during your visit.
Here are the best ghost tours in Edinburgh to help you make the most out of your next visit 1.
City of the Dead City of the Dead is one of the top-rated ghost tours in Edinburgh and itâ€™s the company I went with during my first visit to the vaults.
The underground vaults were built in 1788 and used as storage space and workshops for businesses near the South Bridge.
However the bridge was poorly constructed and water from the surface would leak down into the vaults.
The vaults were then abandoned in 1795 and became slums turning into a red-light district with countless brothels and pubs.
Additionally the cityâ€™s poor called these vaults home.
The rooms were cramped and dark and had poorly circulated air and no sunlight running water or sanitation.
Crime was widespread but by 1820 the leaking became so intense that even the squatters had left.
The story I remember most is of a girl and her mother.
The little girl felt someone grab her hand.
Thinking it was her mom she grabbed back.
But the hand according to the story felt weirdâ€? and slowly kept squeezing her hand until it hurt.
When the girl said Youâ€™re hurting meâ€? the mother said Iâ€™m over here honey.â€? The guide moving the flashlight to the girl found that she was standing alone.
Who held her hand? How did she get separated? I donâ€™t know.
Maybe they made the story up.
Or all the other stories for that matter.
But moving through the vaults in the dark with your mind in overdrive creates an atmosphere of unease that you want on a ghost tour.
Of course the guy jumping out of the corner in the dark doesnâ€™t help at all either! +44 131-225-9044 cityofthedeadtours.com.

I definitely want to do the City of the Dead one the next time I visit.
Reply Tabish Ghafoor October 22 2019 at 808 pm I have lived in Edinburgh for more than 2 years but never knew about these tours.
Probably coz I donâ€™t really go for tour and want to explore on my own.
The ghost tour is really worth it though.
