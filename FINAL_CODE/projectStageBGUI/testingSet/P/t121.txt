I’ve been going there for over nine years and have yet to tire of the history the charm or the food and wine!.
Over the years I’ve taken a million different tours of this amazing city to learn more about what makes it tick.
For four months earlier this year I lived in Paris and had the opportunity to check out even more walking tours.
And there were a lot to check out! There are dozens upon dozens of companies covering all aspects of life in Paris and it can be hard to make a sense of all those endless Viator and Tripadvisor listings.
It’s obscene how many tour companies there are.
I mean I’ve tried so many tour companies and I STILL have more on my list to try and some to retry.
But I still feel like I’ve done enough to warrant a post on some of the best walking tour companies in Paris so today I want to share with you my top favorites Best Overall Tour Learn More Take Walks What makes Walks amazing is that they get better access than most tour companies and hire specialized guides.
You get to skip the line go before or after other tours so you have the space to yourself and get fun guides who are knowledgeable in their field.
They also have a nine-hour full-day tour of the city for anyone looking to really explore it’s a great option if you’re short on time but still want to see everything.
Their tours are reasonably priced and their guides always know their stuff.
I’ve gone on three of their tours and loved them all.
Best Free Tour Learn More New Europe Tours New Europe is one of the most popular free walking tour companies in all of Europe.
Their main free tour takes you around the center of Paris and gives you a historical overview of the city.
They also run a good but paid tour of Montmartre and they have a really fun pub crawl as well if you’re looking to hit the bars with other travelers.
While those may be the best free and paid tours in the city Paris has a lot more to offer — no matter your interests.
Here are 10 other insightful and educational tours in the city! 1.
City Free Tour This free-tour company like New Europe offers a couple great general tours to help you get familiar with the City of Light led by a local expert who can answer your questions.

I also really liked the Scandalous Paris tour which highlights Paris’ brothels and more colorful past.
There’s also an insightful literary tour too that takes you through the literary history of the city’s left bank.

Fat Tire Tours Offering cycling tours of Paris Fat Tire Tours are probably the best bike tour in town.
I don’t think I’d go with anyone else.
Their bike tours are the best.
Do their Versailles tour – and try to do it on Sunday or Tuesday when they stop at the market that is open then and if you can check out their Monet’s Garden tour where you can cycle around the gardens of the famous impressionist while exploring the charming village of Giverny.
Most tours last 2-3 hours though there are several full-day options available too.

Paris by Mouth Paris by Mouth company offers a handful of neighborhood tours that highlight the best food in Paris.
The groups are kept small no more than eight people and they are really focused on providing a lot of information on food history and culture.
It’s like a mini-class more than it is a chance to just eat food though you do that too.
The tours aren’t super budget friendly but if you’re looking for a really detailed food tour this company would be it.
And if you’re a diehard fan of French cheese like I am they also have an entire workshop just for cheese.
It’s amazing.
Tours usually last around three hours.
Tickets start at 110 EUR per person.

They also have a dangerously delicious pastry and chocolate tour that will take you around to half a dozen bakeries and shops to give you a firsthand experience of Paris’s love of decadent desserts.
You’ll get A LOT of food during the tour so come hungry.
Be sure to avoid Monday tours when most markets are closed and you end up just eating in one location instead of going from shop to shop.

I always visit Montmartre every time I’m in Paris but I never took a walking tour with someone who knows much about the city..
I’ll have to look into that for my next trip as I always see bits of history there that I haven’t dived into very deeply yet.
Reply Renuka Walter July 12 2019 at 314 am Beautiful.
Walking is the best way to explore a city.
Such insightful walking tours would do full justice to the beauty of Paris.
I’d love to do the Localers and then may be do a walking tour of my own later.
Reply Querencia July 15 2019 at 1113 am Loved the insight given for each type of tours.
Would love to take up the Context travel whenever I could make it.
