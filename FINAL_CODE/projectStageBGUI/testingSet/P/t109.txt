Whether youâ€™re looking for a relaxing stay or to party the night away the city has something for everyone! Tokyo does hostels right.
Iâ€™ve been visiting Tokyo for years now and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Tokyo are Location â€“ Tokyo is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.

Price â€“ In Tokyo you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
