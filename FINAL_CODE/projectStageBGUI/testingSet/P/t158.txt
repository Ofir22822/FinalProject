I always liked London but it wasnâ€™t until I spent a few weeks there last summer that I fell in love with London.
I didnâ€™t want to leave.
London is a sprawling city covering 607 square miles and home to over eight million people.
While the city may be expensive though like any big city it has lots of free things to do there itâ€™s popularity means there are lots of hostels in the city.
Hundreds upon hundreds.
Iâ€™ve been visiting London for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in London are Location â€“ London is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In London you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free or cheap breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in London that I like the most.
If you donâ€™t want to read the longer list below the following hostels are the best in each category Best Hostel for Budget Travelers The Walrus Hostel or The Dictionary Best Hostel for Families SoHostel Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers Wombats City Hostel London Best Hostel for Digital Nomads The Walrus Hostel Best Hostel for Partying St.

Thereâ€™s also a pool and foosball table.
The beds are plush but there are not many charging plugs in the walls so youâ€™ll have to fight for space.

Some of the rooms are even former jail cells! Thereâ€™s a huge downstairs kitchen/bar area where you can work eat socialize and drink.
They host a lot of unique events like solo traveler meet-ups and DJ + Bingo nights.
The dorms are kind of cramped that eight bed really should of been a six bed but they have curtains on the side individual lights and outlets and lockers.

Thereâ€™s a great party vibe and the friendly hotel staff will help you arrange tours and activities.
Plus the 1 GBP breakfast canâ€™t be beat! I love the old wooden dÃ©cor of the building as you feel more like youâ€™re in a home than a hostel.

Wombats City Hostel London The Wombats City Hostel is located in a beautiful refurbished building that used to be a sailorâ€™s hostel.
This led to the current dÃ©cor and the wooden bunk beds that are unfortunately a bit squeaky.
The rooms are a nice size and there are activities planned most nights of the week like walking tours and karaoke.
The hostelâ€™s central location is one of its best features â€“ itâ€™s super close to Londonâ€™s main attractions like the Tower Bridge the Tower of London and City Hall.

This is a pretty big party place with an outdoor terrace regular beer pong nights and musical performances.
There are a ton of social events to get you well acquainted with your fellow travelers! Itâ€™s the first hostel in London to have cozy pod-style beds.

YHA London YHA has six London locations but the Earls Court and Oxford Street locations are my favorite.
These hostels both have dorms and private rooms.
The rooms are typically very clean and safe and both locations host activities every week including free walking tours and movie nights.
The Earls Court location is in a recently refurbished Victorian building.
The Oxford Street location is colorful and cheerful but not great for families as it does get pretty loud in the evenings.

Great list of cool places The Dictionary looks awesome! When did you stay there? The swing seems fun Reply Keith Lutz February 21 2019 at 601 pm Iâ€™m single male and old well Iâ€™m 66 now but I was 63 when I stayed at The Walrus in London for 5 nights.
My bed was in a 10 bed mixed dorm on the top floor that should have only had 8 beds.
Six of the bunks were occupied by tiny Korean girls whose rolling cases were bigger than them and took up a lot of floor space.
I was there during World Cup Rugby week so the rest of my roommates could be rather boisterous at times.
I suspect that my presence as the â€˜old manâ€™ in the bottom bunk may have served as a calming influence on occasion.
The pub downstairs was a lot of fun with good beer and good natured banter between rival rugby fans.
Reply John Smith August 3 2019 at 824 pm Its always a dream for everyone to visit to London once in a life.
