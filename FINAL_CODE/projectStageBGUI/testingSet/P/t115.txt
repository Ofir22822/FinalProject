Luckily I’ve been visiting Bangkok for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Bangkok are Location – Bangkok is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.

Price – In Bangkok you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi though virtually none include free breakfast.
If you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
