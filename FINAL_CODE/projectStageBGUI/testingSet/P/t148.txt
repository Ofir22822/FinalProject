As Iâ€™ve come to learn â€” and as any traveler will tell you â€” things donâ€™t always go as planned.
You just never know what will happen.
Sure nine times out of ten youâ€™ll be completely fine.
But every now and then youâ€™ll stumble into an unfortunate situation.
Maybe itâ€™s just a missed flight or a delayed connection.
Maybe your wallet disappears while riding a crowded bus.
Maybe like me you burst an eardrum while scuba diving.
Bad things unfortunately do happen when you travel.
And they can get really expensive if youâ€™re injured or fall sick abroad and are not insured.
But what about if youâ€™re taking a cruise â€” how does travel insurance work then? Well of course you still need travel insurance if youâ€™re on a cruise but there are some extra things youâ€™ll want to be aware of.
7 Things to Look for in a Cruise Travel Insurance Policy 1.
Make sure that whichever travel insurance policy you choose you double-check that itâ€™s valid for any emergency and problem that might arise on a cruise specifically.
Often cruise coverage is an extra charge on top of your regular travel insurance.
2.
Even if youâ€™re cruising close to home you may still run into unforeseen issues.
For example in the United States medical insurance stops covering you when your ship is more than six hours away from a US port in Australia it stops as soon as your ship leaves port.
For that reason youâ€™ll want to get a policy that covers you even if youâ€™re in/around your home country.
3.
Be aware that the treatment for less serious medical conditions â€” the kinds that donâ€™t require you to leave the trip â€” are more expensive on a cruise ship than on land.
Make sure your policy has a sufficient amount of medical coverage of at least $100000 USD.
4.
Remember if you fall seriously ill when youâ€™re at sea and you need to be evacuated to a hospital itâ€™s more expensive than if youâ€™re already on land.
Evacuation by helicopter to the nearest treatment facility can be in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Make sure your policy has sufficient evacuation coverage.
If you donâ€™t want to get stuck in that nearestâ€? hospital consider getting Medjet.
They are the premier membership program that then gets you all the way to a hospital at home.
5.
Be sure to have cancellation delay or trip interruption coverage too.
For example if you have a flight delay that means youâ€™ll miss the start of the cruise itâ€™s a lot more difficult to deal with than just arriving late for a land-based trip.
Hurricanes or other severe weather events also affect cruises significantly and youâ€™ll want your insurance policy to take that into account.
6.
Take a look at the shore activities you might participate in during the cruise and check if any need to be mentioned to your insurer like certain adventure activities or water sports.
7.
Unlike other kinds of travel you might be more likely to take valuable jewelry and expensive clothing on a cruise for some of the fancy dinners and events cruise ships hold.
Often a regular travel insurance policy will only cover these items up to a certain value so check that your belongings are covered against possible loss or theft.
What is the Best Cruise Travel Insurance? With so much to consider it can be hard to decide which cruise travel insurance to choose.
Be aware that while many cruise companies offer their own insurance the conditions are often stricter and you might find it hard to make a claim.
For example they often will only reimburse up to 75% of your expenses tend to have only a short list of reasons you are able to cancel for and rarely cover pre-existing medical conditions.
Youâ€™re always better off using a third-party insurer.
Whichever policy you decide on itâ€™s vital that you read the policy details carefully so you know exactly what you are covered for.
The insurers below are some I recommend that have specific cruise insurance policies and offer a decent amount of coverage for a lot of potential mishaps.
Travel Guard Travel Guard has specific cruise insurance policies which makes it simpler than trying to find an add-on.
If youâ€™re getting a quote online theyâ€™ll ask you to specify if youâ€™re taking a plane a cruise or both.
They cover any emergency travel assistance trip interruption delay or cancellation.
Medical expenses and emergency evacuation are covered but the maximum amount varies between the essential preferred and deluxe plans the essential plan includes a $150000 limit on emergency evacuation which might not be quite enough from some parts of the world but you can get up to a million dollars of coverage on the deluxe plan.
VisitorsCoverage/IMG In early 2019 VisitorsCoverage and IMG partnered to launch a new insurance product specifically for cruise travelers called SafeCruise.
The SafeCruise plan includes all the extra protection you need as a cruise traveler and even has an upgrade option to include coverage of up to 75% of prepaid nonrefundable costs if you cancel for any reason at all.
The emergency evacuation or medical repatriation coverage has a high limit of $1000000.
Additionally as long as you purchase insurance by the time you make your final trip payment thereâ€™s a waiver for most pre-existing conditions too.
Insure My Trip Insure My Trip is an unbiased aggregator site that will look at many different insurance policies to find the one that best fits your needs.
For example if your cruise is during hurricane season to an area that might be affected its search algorithm takes that into account and recommends travel insurance policies with good coverage for weather problems.
*** Donâ€™t go on a cruise without proper travel insurance.
However you need to be aware that for a cruise you have to pay a bit more attention than usual to the conditions of the policy.
Make sure that any policy you choose covers you sufficiently for medical evacuation medical treatment onboard and other mishaps like missed connections stolen luggage delays and cancellations.
If you canâ€™t afford to add cruise travel insurance on to the costs of your trip you probably canâ€™t afford to travel.
Itâ€™s just not worth the risk of coming home with a bill in the tens of thousands of dollars or more if something unexpected goes wrong.
In my experience itâ€™s always better to be safe than sorry.
The peace of mind is worth the extra cost.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
I use them all the time.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.
