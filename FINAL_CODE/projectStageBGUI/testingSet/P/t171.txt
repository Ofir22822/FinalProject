Comment /04/25/2020 Share Seville the fourth largest city in Spain is a city with an impressive historical value due to its long history dated back to the time of the Romans 2000 years ago.
From exploring a gigantic palace to learning the history of bullfighting Seville offers countless activities for you to do.
Seville was the second city I visited right after Madrid and if you think Madrid is already laid-back try visiting Seville.
With its countless parks artistic buildings and the always-sunny weather you may be here for days before you see everything.

Otherwise a fast train is another good option but it will be more expensive.
If you are taking a bus from Madrid be sure to ask your hostel for the bus schedule.
Once you know which bus you want to take go to the EstaciÃ³n Sur bus station an hour earlier and get your ticket sorted.
I went with the Socibus.es since it was the cheapest one and it ran that day.
You can also go with FlixBus as they are cheap reliable and run widely throughout Europe.
How to Get Around Seville Seville can easily be done on foot.
If the heat is unbearable then you can hop on the tram that runs throughout the city.
Where to Stay in Seville Budget - Sevilla Kitsch Hostel Art - 18 USD/Night Dorm Mid-Range - The Boutike Hostel Mid-Range - 63 USD / Night Double/Twin Room Daily Budget Traveling here on average will cost you more than traveling in most countries out there.
You can expect to spend around 45 - 65 USD per day per person with food accommodation and transportation.
Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling which is leaning more toward the budget side of things.
If you want to stick to this budget expect to sleep in dorms eat out only a few times and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation which often times involves walking.
Travel Insurance If you are looking for travel insurance to go along with your trip to Spain I would recommend WorldNomads.com which is what I use to look for a travel insurance that fits my kind of adventure.
They have a simple and flexible search system that allowed me to find the right insurance for the right amount of time at an affordable price in seconds.
If you need travel insurance give WorldNomads.com a try.
Get a Quote from World Nomads What to Do in Seville Geek out at the Plaza de Espana This is possibly one of the best attraction in Seville.
A gigantic red palace located near the Maria Luisa Park.
Its vast space unique architectural design and its humongous size made it a must-see place in Seville.
To make this place even better for you it is known that this place was used to shoot a scene in one of the prequels of the movie Star Wars! Usually a place this beautiful is usually crowded with tourists but this was not the case for me.
Possibly due to its vast space and an open-air style building it felt like I had the whole place to myself.
Relax in the Maria Luisa Park Across from the Plaza de Espana is a beautiful park where you can hide from the raging sun to be among the beautiful nature and chirrping birds.
Be sure to observe every detail of the structure you run into in the park from the beautiful bridges over tiny canals to a resting stop that looked almost like it was taken straight from a fairy tale.
Stare at the Cathedral in wonder As you walk around the old town you cant mistaken this cathedral for anything else.
This gothic-style church is the third-largest church in the world.
Even without going inside you can appreciate the intricate detail and hard work that went into bringing this massive piece of magnificent to life.
I was unable to go inside due to some event that took place when I was there so if you have a chance to go in dont hesitate.
I heard the detail inside are even more breathtaking.
Walk around the AlcÃ¡zar of Seville A little bit south of the Cathedral lies another impressive palace called AlcÃ¡zar of Seville.
Within that palace is heaven..
or at least a park that resembles it.
Its lush green vegetation white walls and beautiful floras contradict the exterior of the palace.
I spent at least 2 hours in here just walking around and getting lost in the park.
Check out the Metropol Parasol To spice things up a little lets take a break from all the old structure and marvel at the modern creation that is the Metropol Parasol.
I found that this is where the cool kids like the hang out chilling out with friends skateboarding etc.
Even though this building is drastically different in style compared to all the other buildings around it surprisingly it did not seem so to me.
Somehow it blended in very well with the city.
Eat Tapas by the River in Triana People usually go into Seville old town to find something to eat even though they know that it will be overpriced and crowded with tourists.
If you are looking for a more laid back and authentic experience all you have to do is cross the river to Triana and eat at one of the many tapas bars along the river like all the locals do.
Las Golondrinas 2 is a good place if you crave authentic tapas for a bargain.
Digital Nomad friendly cafe Finding a cafe where you can sit and work without getting a death stare from the owner in Spain outside major cities has proved to be challenging.
Due to the culture here most cafes are a hybrid between a tapas bar and a coffee shop.
Since they also serve food as well as coffee it is uncommon for people to sit in one of these tapas bars and work away.
I was unable to find a good local cafe here for work unfortunately so I would suggest you stick to StarBucks or stay at your hostels.
A location of a Starbucks where you can work from.
