Meininger Berlin Tiergarten This hostel feels more like a traveler/backpacker hotel.
The rooms are spacious the beds have comfortable mattresses there are big storage spaces and rooms have ensuite bathrooms.
The company is part of a chain that stretches across Europe and you’ll often find it used for group tours school trips and families so it’s generally pretty quiet.
Pets are allowed for an extra 10 EUR/11 USD per night.

Wombats I love Wombats.
It’s a bit big for a hostel as there are hundreds of beds the only downside but its filled travelers has really snug beds ensuite bathrooms lockers and a big breakfast.
It’s clean and there’s a fully equipped kitchen too.
But the real highlight is the rooftop bar with the outdoor patio that offers sweeping views of the city! It’s an awesome spot to drink a beer and meet people! The staff here go over and above too which is a huge perk if you want to ask lots of questions and get some itinerary input.

St.
Christopher’s If you’re looking to party St.
Christopher’s is the place for you.
The bar next door gets quite lively and they do a lot of drink specials you get 25% off on food as a guest too.
I had some really fun moments here though there’s not much common space at the hostel so the bar really is the best place to meet people they try to get everyone there to eat and drink as much as possible.
If you’re not looking to drink or party this won’t be the best place to stay.
But if you are the rooms here are clean and it’s pretty quiet in the hostel itself.
It’s located in Mitte near Alexanderplatz the TV Tower and Museum Island.

The Cat’s Pajamas Hostel What I love about this hostel is that it’s a quiet calm place to stay.
There’s a nice kitchen a good common area and less focus on drinking than in other hostels.
The beds and rooms are average not great but not bad and the lockers in the rooms are very small.
But each bunk has a light and power outlet and towels and hair dryers are included.
It’s in Kreuzkölln — in the middle of Kreuzberg and Neukölln — which is one of the best areas of Berlin for drinking and dining.
If you’re not looking to party and meet people this is a hostel worth staying at.
