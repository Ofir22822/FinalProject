But it’s also surrounded by stunning landscapes with both the ocean and the mountains within easy reach.
It’s known for being a laid-back eclectic city — and an expensive one too.
Since Seattle can be a little pricey budget travelers will likely want to stay in a hostel.
Even with the prevalence of Airbnb hostels in Seattle are still the cheapest form of accommodation — and they’re usually perfect for meeting other travelers too.
That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Seattle are Location – Seattle is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price – In Seattle you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Seattle that I like the most Price Legend per night $ = Under $30 USD $$ = $30-40 USD $$$ = Over $40 USD 1.
Green Tortoise Seattle Hostel This is my favorite hostel in Seattle.
The dorm beds have privacy curtains and there are enough outlets to charge everything you might bring.
The rooms aren’t very large though and the luggage storage is under the bottom bunk so if you’re sleeping there and your bunkmate needs something you’ll definitely hear it.
You’ll also hear music and people late at night given its central location so bring earplugs.
That said the bathrooms here really set this hostel apart from others they have rainfall showerheads and heated tile floors.
The hostel also provides free breakfast complete with eggs cereal fruit and bread.
There is a communal kitchen and common room with foosball and other games.
They also run free walking tours and pub crawls and even host weekly ice cream socials! Green Tortoise is located across the street from the iconic Pike Place Market as well as the first-ever Starbucks.
It’s also not far from other well-known sites like the Great Wheel and the Crocodile a bar famous for its live music — Nirvana Pearl Jam and other famous bands have played here.
If you want the best hostel experience in the city stay here.
