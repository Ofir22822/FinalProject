Itâ€™s fast-paced futuristic and bursting with weird and wonderful activities to keep you busy including gorgeous shrines palaces and temples hip clubs and bars and fashionable people and shopping not to mention cherry blossoms.
Tokyo lives up to all the hype youâ€™ve heard about it.
You never know what youâ€™ll find here.
One second youâ€™ll run into a group of women dressed in pig masks and â€™80s dresses and the next youâ€™re in a robot cafÃ©.
Or a centuries-old temple.
Itâ€™s also one of the biggest cities in the world home to over 13 million people â€” almost 40 million if you count the Greater Tokyo Area.
Itâ€™s massive! Not surprisingly itâ€™ll take some time to see it all.
And there are so many nooks and crannies to explore that itâ€™s easy to get lost.
Here is my suggested itinerary on how to visit the best restaurants sites and activities in Tokyo Tokyo Itinerary Highlights Day 1 Fish Market Ueno Park Asakusa & more! Day 2 Imperial Palace Below the Girders Quirky Cafes & more! Day 3 Shinjuku Shibuya Robots & more! Day 4 Take a Day Trip Day 5 Tokyo Tower Sumo Samurai & more! Tokyo Itinerary Day 1 Visit the Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Market As of 2018 the main fish market moved to Toyosu.
The new market is twice the size of Tsukiji making it the largest fish market in the world.
Just make sure to get a visitorâ€™s pass when you enter.
Eat just-caught sushi for breakfast and marvel at the chaotic atmosphere at the worldâ€™s largest tuna market.
The auction here powers much of the worldâ€™s sushi supply and it is truly breathtaking.
All around you are fish with colors and shapes you didnâ€™t know existed.
I have never seen more seafood I couldnâ€™t identify.
The old outer market where you can find food and shops is still in the same location in Tsukiji.
You can still head there to eat and look around but the main market is now in Toyosu.
Tsukiji Fish Market 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji Chuo +81 3-3542-1111.

Relax in Ueno Park Ueno Park is a lovely spot to spend the day.
Itâ€™s a perfect spot to photograph the many cherry trees and have a picnic.

Established in 1872 this massive building houses one of the worldâ€™s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia particularly Japan.

Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum Built in 1933 this small museum used to be the official residence of the Prince and Princess Asaka.
The prince had studied in Paris and wanted to bring the art deco style to Japan which explains the buildingâ€™s style and decorations.
In 1983 the residence became a museum and is now home to a rotating series of modern art exhibitions.

Stroll Along the Meguro River The Meguro River weaves almost five miles through the city and makes for a magnificent stroll.
Thereâ€™s a path with a bit of green space that follows the water so plenty of locals walk or exercise there.
In the spring youâ€™ll be able to see a lot of cherry blossoms.
Check out Asakusa If you want to check out some of Tokyoâ€™s historic religious sites be sure to spend some time wandering around Asakusa.
Two places that Iâ€™d suggest you visit are Senso-ji â€“ This is Tokyoâ€™s most popular and famous temple.
Itâ€™s beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the beautiful Kaminari Gate.
Thereâ€™s a huge statue of Kannon the goddess of mercy inside the main hall.
Look at the wooden wishesâ€? cards hanging off to the side you can write your own and join the artistic display.
Itâ€™s very busy during the day so maybe check out the grounds in the evening.
2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa Taito +81 3-3842-0181 senso-ji.jp.
The grounds are open 24/7 though the temple itself is open daily 6am-5pm.
Admission is free.
Asakusa Shrine â€“ Not far from Senso-ji is this Shinto shrine.
This is much more peaceful than Senso-ji as there are fewer people and youâ€™ll able to see people praying meditating or performing traditional rituals.
It was built during the Edo period and survived the air raids of World War II.
2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa Taito +81 3-3844-1575 asakusajinja.jp.
Open daily 9am-430pm.
Admission is free.
Have Dinner with Ninjas For a unique dining experience head to Ninja Akasaka a ninja-themed restaurant designed like an Edo-era building with waitstaff clothed in stereotypical all-black garb and trained in all sorts of tricks and illusions.
Youâ€™ll order off old scrolls while being entertained by the skillful tricks of your server! Itâ€™s super fun.
Tokyu Plaza Akasaka +81 3-5157-3936 ninjaakasaka.com.
Open daily 5pm-1030pm 945pm on Sundays Drink in Golden Gai If you are looking for something interesting to do at night this alley of backstreet bars is a cool spot to start at.
There isnâ€™t much going on here during the day but come sundown these zigzag hallways and closet-sized beer rooms are filled with interesting people and cheap drinks.
Tokyo Itinerary Day 2 Stop by the Imperial Palace The Imperial Palace home to the Emperor of Japan is a terrific spot to learn about Japanâ€™s history and culture.
Formerly Edo Castle it was built in the 15th century and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day.
When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace.
Though you canâ€™t go inside or get super close the building is amazing.
It is surrounded by beautiful grounds and a park and thereâ€™s a moat around the stone walls.
You can also see the changing of the guard ceremony though itâ€™s relatively low-key and unassuming.
Admission to the grounds is free.
Visit the National Art Center Opened in 2007 this museum and gallery doesnâ€™t actually have a permanent collection but rather houses a never-ending series of temporary exhibitions from impressionism to modern art.
Check their website to see what is currently being shown.
7 Chome-22-2 Roppongi +81 3-5777-8600 nact.jp.

Eat Below the Girders Not far from Ginza is the Yurakucho neighborhood.
Below the elevated train tracks at Yurakucho Station is a 700m-long stretch of restaurants and bars.
There are wine bars beer pubs and casual restaurants filled with businessmen.
If you want to get a sense of local city life this is a good neighborhood to explore after the workday is over.
Superhero Go-Karting Want to speed around the streets of Tokyo in a go-kart while wearing a costume? Of course you do! MariCar is a real-life Mario Bros.

A budget-friendly sento will cost you just under 1000 JPY.

Whether youâ€™re looking to shop or just want to take in the scene it makes for a cool neighborhood to explore.
Stroll through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden This park is over 144 acres with some 20000 trees.
Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II during the air raids but was rebuilt and reopened in 1949.
During spring this beautiful park is one of the best spaces to see cherry blossoms.
My favorite part is the Japanese landscape garden which has several ponds with bridges and islands.
Itâ€™s a peaceful little oasis within the hustle and bustle of the city.

Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-4pm.

Visit Shibuya Crossing This is quite possibly the busiest and most famous intersection in the world.

Eat at the Robot Restaurant This restaurant is an absolute sensory overload.

Where to Eat Tokyo is so huge and has so many dining options that it would be impossible to pick just two or three favorites.
Here are just a few of my favorite restaurants in Tokyo Bifteck Kawamura Ginza â€“ The steak here basically melted in my mouth and exploded with flavor.
I found it a bit too high-end and overpriced for me though.

8F Chuo 104-0061 +81 3-6252-5011 bifteck.co.jp.
Ichiran Shibuya â€“ This ramen spot served one of the best meals I had my entire trip.

My wife and I are going to be spending 6 weeks in Tokyo this summer and this has helped us a lot in developing an itinerary.
Many thanks Matt! Reply Hazel Joy April 29 2019 at 406 pm Tokyo looks like a daunting city but you have put together a list of things to do which seems pretty easy to follow.
Iâ€™ve always wanted to go to Japan every since seeing Lost in Translationâ€? and ever since hearing that the Okinawa lifestyle is one of the worldâ€™s healthiest.
And dinner with ninjas? Hell yeah sign me up! Reply Rob May 7 2019 at 959 pm I lived in Japan recently for 6 months near Tokyo.
And I have to say this is a very good itinerary.
One canâ€™t really do it all in a week but there are a lot of good suggestions here.
One more to add would be the go-carts.
You drive around Tokyo for an hour or two in go-carts and see a lot of the city.
Itâ€™s fun.
Just bring an international drivers license which is easy to get at AAA.
Reply Eunice Tan February 22 2020 at 1228 am This is a great itinerary for getting the most out of your time in Tokyo! Iâ€™ve been to Tokyo several times now and havenâ€™t done half the things on this list.
Really makes me want to go back again.
