Iâ€™ve never been to the region and itâ€™s long one thatâ€™s held great appeal to me.
It seems raw beautiful and unspoiled.
So when someone reached out to write a guest post on a country there I was excited.
It was a chance to learn a little before I hopefully go.
In this guest post traveler and writer Paul McDougal breaks down what itâ€™s like to travel Tajikistan on a budget.
Aptly and romantically known as The Roof of the Worldâ€? Tajikistan is a hikersâ€™ paradise.
More than 93% of the country is defined as mountainous â€” and more than 50% of that sits at over 3000 meters 9800 feet! Itâ€™s a striking country full of glacial peaks and mountain lakes that are best for multiday hikes but equally astounding on short jaunts too.
Traveling around Tajikistan requires a sense of adventure as the nation is also dotted with poor-quality roads rudimentary facilities and a massive lack of infrastructure.
But after spending almost a month there I learned that itâ€™s easy and affordable to get around these problems with a smile and a shrug.
Many tourists spend more money than necessary when in Tajikistan.
Most do so on an organized tour which is why thereâ€™s a prevailing â€” and inaccurate â€” idea that itâ€™s expensive to visit the country.
A ten-day organized tour booked online can cost anywhere from $1500 to $3500 USD equivalent to a hefty $150-350 a day.
But if you travel independently you can easily navigate this country for about $45 USD per day.
So how do you see Tajikistan on a budget? Hereâ€™s how Transportation Instead of booking a tour through an online agent you have four much more affordable ways to get around to choose from 1.
Find a multiday driver when you arrive Hostels and guesthouses can put you in contact with local drivers with whom you can negotiate your own rate itinerary and trip length.
Typically travelers spend $50-100 per day per person for this.
The better your negotiation skills and the more stubborn you are the greater the chance youâ€™ll get a driver for closer to $50 a day.
Drivers can be found in Murghab Khorog Dushanbe and other larger places.
If youâ€™re traveling the Pamir Highway like pretty much everyone else in Tajikistan you can also find drivers in Kyrgyzstanâ€™s second-biggest city Osh.
2.
Hire a 4WD yourself This typically costs around $100 per day for the vehicle so if youâ€™re traveling with a few people this is a great choice.
It gives you freedom and itâ€™s good for your budget! Itâ€™s very easy to organize this upon arrival.
All hotels hostels and guesthouses in both Osh and Dushanbe can put you into contact with agencies that can arrange 4WD rentals.
Donâ€™t arrange this online unless you want to spend more money.
3.
Public transport Long-distance public transport doesnâ€™t really exist in Tajikistan.
However enterprising locals have filled this gap in a very affordable way.
Every day before they travel from one city or town to another to go about their daily business they always ensure that every single spot in their vehicle is filled.
To find these travel opportunities ask your guesthouse where the bus stationâ€? is.
Theyâ€™ll direct you to a car-crammed area usually near a market where there will be drivers waiting to fill their cars.
Using this method itâ€™s not unusual to end up squashed into the back of an ancient car with four other people on a five-hour trip.
These trips typically only costs around $10.
And itâ€™s a great way to immerse yourself in local life.
The price of the trip depends upon its length.
The most I paid was for any single trip was $35 USD for a 12-hour 600-mile voyage from Khorog to Dushanbe.
And that was in a 4WD.
A quick side note If youâ€™re traveling within a city or town there are many small minibuses marshrutkas that can take you from one destination to another along prescribed routes for the measly price of around $0.20 USD.
But along those routes theyâ€™ll stop anywhere to take on new passengers and drop off others.
And I mean anywhere houses outdoor markets the middle of busy roads â€” itâ€™s all fair game.
4.
Hitchhiking For the vast majority of my trips in Tajikistan I hitchhiked.
Local people hitchhike in Tajikistan every single day â€” itâ€™s a valid recognized method of transport here as not everyone has a car and as mentioned above public transportation is scarce.
When you hitchhike in Tajikistan donâ€™t stick out your thumb.
Keep your stretched-out hand parallel to the ground and wave it up and down.
Depending on where youâ€™re hitchhiking you will probably have to wait a while â€” on some barren stretches of road you might wait thirty minutes to see one car.
But if that car has an empty spot it will stop and take you without fail.
You might have to pay a little money.
I experienced nothing but positivity and warmth doing this.
People were happy to take me and introduced me to all sorts of Tajik food drinks and music.
Itâ€™s not unusual for those who pick you up to offer you snacks buy you a meal or take you to their home.
I always offered money in return for these treats but it was never accepted.
Accommodation 1.
Guesthouses In any town or city youâ€™ll see houses with the word guesthouseâ€? written on them.
Go inside one and strike a deal.
Itâ€™s the easiest and most affordable accommodation the perfect way to save money and have a better experience.
Youâ€™ll be given great food and an even greater welcome.
Throughout Tajikistan local people will let you stay in their home for around $10-15 a night.
This usually will cover breakfast and dinner too.
You can negotiate lunch for a little more if you like â€” or you can eat elsewhere.
Most guesthouses offer much the same welcome and much the same food so it doesnâ€™t really matter which you choose.
Often if youâ€™re in a car with Tajiks whether through hitchhiking or other means theyâ€™ll take you a guesthouse they know of.
And itâ€™ll usually be a good one so donâ€™t be too worried about scams.
And even if you canâ€™t find an official guesthouse youâ€™ll find a friendly local whoâ€™ll let you stay at their home for a small price.
2.
Hotels and hostels These can be equally budget-friendly if you choose the right places.
Some hotels are very expensive but spots such as Pamir Hotel in Murghab offer affordable stays starting at around $15 USD a night.
Some smaller towns such as Jelondy a popular hot spring spot for locals also offer hotel stays for around $10 USD.
Generally speaking if a town is a popular vacation spot for Tajiks there will be a cheap hotel.
Hostels are a good cheap option in bigger towns and cities and especially in Dushanbe.
Green House Hostel in particular is a fantastic affordable hub and is packed with travelers.
Itâ€™s an excellent place to team up with others to save on transport costs.
3.
Camping Your third option for accommodation is camping.
In some ways Tajikistan is very camper friendly.
Iâ€™m not sure what the actual laws are on wild camping but Iâ€™d be very surprised if any exist.
Although I didnâ€™t do so myself I met many people who camped in the wild and none of them encountered any trouble.
You should of course follow the normal rules of wild camping donâ€™t camp in the same place for more than one night donâ€™t camp on private land without permission and donâ€™t camp in cities.
You should also research whether there are any dangers in the particular area youâ€™re keen to camp.
But otherwise you will not draw any attention since camping is very well tolerated here.
Moreover guesthouses and hotels will often let you pitch your tent on their land for only $2 or $3 USD.
Note the harsh weather conditions can often make camping an unpleasant experience.
Because much of Tajikistan lies at such a high elevation the temperatures can be unpleasant and even dangerous â€” and the ground in some conditions can be too tough to push tent pegs into.
So you should be careful when planning where you want to camp.
Food As Iâ€™ve mentioned youâ€™ll likely eat most of your meals in guesthouses.
These will often consist of flat bread salad soup and endlessly flowing cups of tea.
Other popular edible offerings include plov a pilaf-style rice dish with meat and vegetables and manti steamed lamb dumplings.
Outside of guesthouses youâ€™ll find a more varied and versatile selection of food such as kebabs and fried noodles.
You can get your mouth around all of these morsels for low prices in local cafeterias.
The food is tasty and filling and it comes in big portions for less than $2 USD.
If you eat at a more up-market restaurant youâ€™ll be paying closer to $5 USD.
Takeaway stands in bigger towns and cities sell kebabs and samsas which are similar to Indian samosas often for around $1 USD while outdoor markets are an excellent place to buy fresh fruit and vegetables â€” along with special pickles candies and more â€” for very cheap prices.
A quick tip on food bring hand sanitizer and toilet paper! Everyone gets sick in Tajikistan.
I have the worldâ€™s strongest stomach and even I got sick on three separate occasions.
You should also wash your hands as much as possible and avoid putting them into your mouth after handling money.
And donâ€™t drink the tap water! Hiking If you hire a private guide from an agency it can be expensive.
Some people pay up to $100 USD a day for a hiking guide.
But thereâ€™s no need to do this.
Instead simply ask at your guesthouse for a local hiking guide.
The people who live in these towns and villages know the areas extremely well.
They know all the paths passes and landscapes.
And for only a few dollars these unofficial guides will take you to and through the mountains for as long as you like.
Whether you want a day hike or a multiday expedition thereâ€™ll be someone in the village who can take you there.
I hiked for an entire day in Bulunkul for less than $10 USD and went on a two-day hike in Darshai for less than $25 USD per day.
There are very few marked routes in Tajikistan.
Some are marked on maps.me but thereâ€™s very little of the infrastructure that youâ€™ll find in other countries.
So while you can hike independently itâ€™s essential you take a good map a good compass and good equipment â€” and that you know what youâ€™re doing! Make sure you carry a refillable water bottle along with water purification tables â€” this will save you money too.
Are there any other things to see in Tajikistan? Pretty much everyone who travels to Tajikistan does so for the hiking and mountain scenery so I wouldnâ€™t recommend going all the way there if your interest isnâ€™t piqued by peaks.
That said there are a small number of other things to do Museums Dushanbe has a few small museums.
The three most notable are the National Museum the Museum of Antiquities and the Museum of Musical Instruments.
These cost between $1 and $5 USD so theyâ€™re a good idea if youâ€™re looking for something to pass the time inexpensively.
Other small towns and cities have small local-interest museums.
Rudaki Park Central Asian cities are awash with beautiful parks.
And Rudaki Park is one of the best.
Itâ€™s a great way to people-watch and itâ€™s beautifully lit after sunset.
But best of all itâ€™s free! Outdoor Markets There are food markets everywhere which make for another great free activity.
Walking tours Some hostels offer walking tours which can be a nice way to see the city.
These are usually pay-what-you-like so you donâ€™t have to spend much money.
Frequently Asked Questions about Tajikistan Where should I get my currency? ATMs are notoriously unreliable in Tajikistan so make sure you bring enough US dollars to cover your whole trip.
Yes some ATMs will work but finding them can be a chore and having cash gives you more peace of mind.
Outdoor markets/bazaars offer the best exchange rates better than banks.
Look for small shacks with rates written on a sign.
Most tourist establishments such as hotels and guesthouses will also exchange money so itâ€™s always easy to get your hands on Tajik somoni â€” but go to the small market shacks to get more money for your money.
Should I barter in Tajikistan? Tajikistan is a barterersâ€™ economy.
You can negotiate and barter over prices for a whole range of things Food in a market Accommodations Campsite fees 4WD rentals Long-distance rides Hitchhiking Hiking guides Exchange rates But there are things you canâ€™t barter over SIM cards Restaurant prices Short-distance public transport rides Your visa and flights good luck trying Whatâ€™s an overall daily budget in Tajikistan? If youâ€™re a budget traveler you can get by on an average of $45 USD or less per day depending on where you are how youâ€™re traveling and what you like to do.
Here are some figures for what you can expect to pay on average for things in USD Dorm bed in a hostel $5-15 Guesthouse with two meals and a bed $10-15 Double room in a cheap hotel $15-20 Public transport/hitchhiking per day $10-15 Restaurant meal $5 Snacks and fruit $3 A day of hiking $10 SIM card $5 *** Tajikistan will give you a hundred reasons to fall in love.
Whether itâ€™s a full cup of tea in a strangerâ€™s home a steaming bowl of plov or a gold-toothed smile every day is full of beautiful experiences.
Most people come here for hiking amid the peaks and mountain lakes.
And rightly so.
But upon leaving what theyâ€™ll remember most is the warmth the hospitality and the unending kindness.
Itâ€™s often true that poorer countries offer the richest welcomes.
And thatâ€™s exactly the case here.
Youâ€™ll leave Tajikistan feeling better than when you arrived.
So donâ€™t let the inaccurate rumors of costly travel deter you.
Not only is Tajikistan possible on a budget itâ€™s better that way.

Youâ€™ve inspired many of my fave trips! Just wanted to say that I think you should have added some kind of safety information on this post.
My good friend Jay was killed on a cycling trip in Tajikistan along with his girlfriend and a few older European travelers in 2018.
At the time it was considered a very safe destination but I believe many governments have changed their opinion.
It was an act of terrorism not an accident.
I travel a lot and understand that one isolated case isnâ€™t always the experience of others.
That being said I would be remiss if I didnâ€™t at least leave this comment.
Iâ€™m know Tajikistan is 99.9% amazing people like the rest of the world.
To everyone out there â€“ enjoy the trip and be safe.
Reply Arne February 12 2020 at 429 am Quite a nice read.
As a part of a school project I am actually going down to Kazakhstan to have a look at what the cotton industry have done to the Aral sea.
And while I am in the area I was planning to take a hike to Tajikistan as well.
Thereâ€™s quite a lot of wrong information about the country online â€“ but this article seem to be quite accurate compared to what other things Iâ€™ve heard from locals.
Reply Steve Rohan March 2 2020 at 1159 pm I visited Aral Aralsk last year and it was quite depressing to see the former thriving fishing town in such a state of decay.
Kazakhstan is a wonderful country though and I hope you enjoy your trip there! Reply Renuka February 13 2020 at 123 am Tajikistan is one of the countries on my wish-list for sure.
As you mentioned itâ€™s great for hiking Iâ€™d love to explore its natural beauty on foot.
But yes making sure that one doesnâ€™t end up spending a lot unnecessarily is so important.
I guess a good research and planning could help.
