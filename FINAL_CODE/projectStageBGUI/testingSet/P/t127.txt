And one of those goals usually involves trying to travel more.
But when you are starved for time and money travel can seem like a pipe dream.
A wish that might never be fulfilled.
Luckily thereâ€™s a wave of positive developments for those who want to travel more cheaper airfare more deal-finding websites and other information online free walking tours in more cities and more opportunities to bypass the traditional travel infrastructure and connect directly into the local way of life via the sharing economy.
So as we get deeper into 2020 I want to share some suggestions on how to travel on a budget this year so you can check off that New Yearâ€™s resolution! Here are some of my top tips to help you 1.
Change Your Mindset Changing your mindset might not be a traditional budget tip but itâ€™s important nonetheless.
Action begets action and as you think of ways to travel cheaper it becomes a game where you try to keep finding ways to save money.
The first step makes all the other steps easier.
Start with a yes I canâ€? mindset.
Donâ€™t think I canâ€™t travelâ€? â€” think Whatâ€™s one thing I can do today to make my trip closer to reality?â€? Life is a mental game.
Do one thing every day that gets you closer to your trip and youâ€™ll find yourself building an unstoppable momentum.
2.
Come Up with a Savings Plans Unless youâ€™re Bill Gates we all need to save more money.
But how do you do that? While life is expensive I do believe there are always ways to save a little more.
Thereâ€™s always something you can cut.
A little bit of savings adds up a lot over time.
Get into the habit of putting money into your travel fund regularly â€” even if itâ€™s just a few dollars a week.
Every little penny will help.
The more you save the more you want to save.
It sort of becomes a game.
Itâ€™s no longer a chore.
Here are some posts on how to save money 22 Ways to Cut Your Expenses and Have Money for Travel The Ultimate Guide to Traveling Cheap How Michael Saved $14k in 6 Months Making $9 Per Hour How I Find the Money to Travel 3.
Score a Flight Deal One of the things that people always tell me holds them back from traveling more is the cost of flights.
But let me tell you we live in an age of cheap airfare.
If you can be flexible with your plans there are always deals.
Sure maybe you canâ€™t take advantage of that sale to Europe next week but you can still find a date and a destination that work for you at a great price if youâ€™re flexible about one or both factors.
I like to use Google Flights.
I type in my home city and then everywhereâ€? and see what the cheapest results are.
I then base my plans around where I can fly to for the least amount of money.
However if you donâ€™t want to do that I think itâ€™s a perfect Friday night activity you can check out some of the following websites that search for deals and email them to you Scottâ€™s Cheap Flights â€“ The best website for finding flight deals from the US The Flight Deal â€“ Incredible deals for flights all around the world Secret Flying â€“ Another site with amazing flight deals from around the globe they find a lot of Asia/Africa/South America deals not found elsewhere 4.
Get Points! Travel hacking the art of collecting points and miles is a great way to save money.
By getting point-yielding credit cards and using a few ninja techniques you can get hundreds of thousands of miles without spending any extra money thus getting you free flights free accommodation and added cash back.
Itâ€™s what all serious travelers do.
Thereâ€™s no excuse not to do it! I mean youâ€™re spending the money anyway so you might as well get some treats for it.
Here are some resources to help you begin How I Earn 1 Million Frequent Flier Miles Every Year The Ultimate Guide to Picking the Best Travel Credit Card The Ultimate Guide to Travel Hacking Even if you arenâ€™t American you still have options as points and miles have gone global Points Hack Australia/New Zealand Head for Points UK Canadian Kilometers Canada 5.
Use the Sharing Economy The sharing economy has led to a plethora of new money-saving and community-building platforms that have made travel even more affordable personal and accessible.
Itâ€™s never been easier to get off the tourist trail connect with locals and experience their pace of life.
I live by these websites when I travel! You should too.
My favorites include Airbnb â€“ The best platform for finding rooms apartments and homes for rent by locals.
Couchsurfing â€“ Great for finding free accommodation often on peopleâ€™s couches and meeting travelers/locals.
The hangout feature on the app is my favorite as you can see who is around to meet up.
Trusted Housesitters â€“ The most comprehensive website to find house-sitting gigs.
You watch a place on vacation while the homeowner is on vacation.
EatWith â€“ Allows you to eat home-cooked meals with locals itâ€™s the Airbnb of food.
It always leads to interesting encounters so itâ€™s one of my favorite things to do.
BlaBlaCar â€“ A ridesharing app that pairs riders with verified locals who have a spare seat in their car.
6.
Find the Free! The world is awash with amazing free travel resources like this website that can help you travel on a budget.
No matter where you are going thereâ€™s probably a blog post on what to do and see there for free or cheaply.
Someone has been there and theyâ€™ve written about it! Make the best use of all them to help you plan your trip.
My favorite search term is free things to do in X.â€? Youâ€™ll always get a result! Additionally donâ€™t be afraid to walk into a hostel â€” even if you arenâ€™t staying there â€” and ask them what to do for cheap.
Their clientele is budget sensitive so they always know what to do and where to go for little money.
7.
Stick to Public Transportation If youâ€™re on a budget skip the taxis and rideshares like Lyft or Uber.
Unless you can lower your cost by sharing a ride with other passengers public transportation is going to be the most cost-effective way to get around.
Not only will it save you money but youâ€™ll get to see how the locals travel too.
Google Maps usually can give you a basic overview of the public transportation options and prices available.
You can find information about day passes and/or multiday passes local tourism offices which will save you even more money.
See the next tip for more about that.
8.
Use Local Tourism Offices Local tourist offices are a wealth of knowledge.
They exist solely to provide you with information on what to see and do.
They often have tons of discounts not found anywhere else and can also keep you updated on local events free tours and the best spots to eat.
They can help you find public transportation discounts and/or multiday passes too.
Donâ€™t skip the local tourist office! They are serverly underutilizted resource.
9.
Get Cheap Accommodation Accommodation is one of the biggest fixed costs travelers have so reducing that cost can lead to big savings on the road.
Iâ€™m sure many backpackers would sleep in a barn if it were the cheapest accommodation they could find! Heck Iâ€™ve slept in hammocks in national parks to save a buck! Since you have to stay somewhere every night reducing this expense can save you a lot of money off the total cost of your trip.
Stay in hostels use Couchsurfing get last minute hotesl on Hotels Tonight stay at universities yes you can do that or try an Airbnb.
Since thereâ€™s a lot of ways to cut your accommodation costs here are my posts on how to get accommodation deals How to Find the Perfect Apartment Rental How to Find Cheap and Free Accommodation How to Crush it on Couchsurfing And here are the websites I use to book cheap places to stay Booking.com â€“ For finding budget hotels and guesthouses.
Hostelworld â€“ The best site for finding hostels.
Agoda â€“ Another great hotel website specifically for Asia.
Hotel Tonight â€“ Offers discounted last-minute hotel stays.
Airbnb â€“ For finding private rooms entire apartments and homes for rent by locals.
10.
Eat Cheap Other than accommodation food is one of the biggest travel costs.
After all everyone needs to eat.
But there are lots of ways to eat on the cheap Go grocery shopping and prepare your own meals Shop at local markets Use apps to find deals Yelp Seamless LaForchette TasteCard RiceBowl Also use the five-block rule.
There seems to be this magical wall that surrounds tourist areas.
Most people donâ€™t go past it.
Itâ€™s been my experience that if you walk five blocks in any direction from a major tourist area you end up losing the crowds and finding the local restaurants.
Tourist restaurants donâ€™t care about quality since tourists arenâ€™t coming back.
Residents do care so places catering to them need to be better â€” and more affordable â€“ or they go out of business.
Those are the places you want to eat at.
Use the above resources to find where the locals eat and avoid crappy food! Moreover check out these articles for tips on eating cheap around the world How to Eat Cheap Around the World How to Eat Around the World on a Plant-Based Diet 11.
Travel Like You Live The majority of people in your destinations donâ€™t spend lots of money per day like tourists do.
Neither do you in your day-to-day life.
So take that mentality with you.
Walk take public transportation grocery shop spend a day in a park and look for deals.
Do the things you do at home every day to keep your costs down.
Too many people get into this mindset that when they go on the road they just have to spend spend spend spend.
Thatâ€™s not true at all.
Thereâ€™s no law that says you have to spend more.
Be smart with your budget â€” just like you are at home.
That will help you save money and prevent you from going home early broke.
*** The world is full of different ways to travel on a budget once you know where to look.
This year make travel happen.
It doesnâ€™t matter if you save only a dollar a week.
What matters is that you take the first step! Action begets action.
Once you take the first step all the other steps will be easier.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.
My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are World Nomads for everyone below 70 Insure My Trip for those over 70 Looking for the best companies to save money with?
