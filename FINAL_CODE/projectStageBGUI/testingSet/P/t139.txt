25 Things to See and Do in Barcelona Popular Posts Everyone Says Iâ€™m Running Away The Ultimate Guide to Traveling Cheap Why Travel Makes You Awesome Destinations Resources Travel Insurance Favorite Hostels Travel Hacking Best Travel Credit Cards Teach English Abroad Favorite Travel Companies Destination Guidebooks Community Member Content Patreon Events Forums Blog School Shop Ethics in Writing The Case of Saudi Arabia Posted 1/8/2020 | January 8th 2020 As I scrolled through my social feeds recently I noticed set against desert backgrounds a number travel influencersâ€? extolling the beauty and virtue of Saudi Arabia.1 But the majority werenâ€™t there to take advantage of the new tourist visa and explore on their own.
No they werenâ€™t there to see what this new openly country was really about.
They were there on paid press trips funded by a company called Gateway KSA an NGO designed to promote the country.
Note The organization says itâ€™s independent of the government but it has Saudi royal family members on its board and given the complete control the family has over the country I doubt they bring in influential Westerners without Royal approval.
Now let me be clear I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with visiting Saudi Arabia.
I have a few friends who just did.
If you want to travel somewhere you should.
People are not their governments and Iâ€™m not one for travel boycotts.
But taking money from a government is a lot different than paying your own way.
As Rick Steves has said travel is a political act and taking government money can create the impression of tacit approval of it.
So when a government offers to sponsor a trip I think the question that needs to be asked is Is this a government I want to appear to support?â€? The government of Saudi Arabia oppresses its people and promotes extremism abroad.
It jails activists including bloggers has a horrible record on womenâ€™s and LGBT rights kills journalists Khashoggi is just the most famous example and suppresses dissent tortures detainees uses flogging and amputation as punishments and is among the worldâ€™s leading executioners.
Those involved in these paid trips say they were simply showing off the destination and the people.
Itâ€™s not about the governmentâ€? they said.
Saudi Arabia is a beautiful place and there are lots of interesting things to see there.â€? No doubt there is beauty in that country and no doubt there are incredibly warm and wonderful people there too.
Yet I believe that taking money from government-funded organizations creates a moral hazard when you consider that the government jails its own bloggers and disappearsâ€? LGBTQ and womenâ€™s rights advocates.
Psychology has shown time and time again everyone tries to reduce dissonance to justify their actions.2 In this case I think those taking these trips were either just clueless about issues with the countries or created rationalizations when a giant check was waved in front of them.
Both reasons are disheartening and are morally shallow.
Thatâ€™s not saying that I always bring up politics or societal conditions in my posts.
Or that itâ€™s necessarily the job of a travel writer to always discuss local politics.
After all no government is perfect.
They all have their faults.
You can find terrible things committed by governments around the world.
But I think some destinations require more detailed and deeper coverage.
How can one go to the Amazon without commenting on policies that lead to its destruction? How can one go on safari without talking about wildlife issues? There are aspects of travel that require more insightful reporting.
Places like Saudi Arabia Syria Nicaragua Chile and North Korea for example are among many places that require more rounded reporting given their political situations and the fact that one is in the middle of a civil war.
Not bringing up the elephant in the room the governmentâ€™s actions also does readers a disservice because it may put them at risk when they visit since they might believe they can travel like the influencer did or how they do in the West.
Press trips are not like regular trips.
They come with handlers special access drivers guides and a host of other benefits a regular traveler will never get.
Now thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that.
Itâ€™s one way industry insiders find out whatâ€™s new.
But washing oneâ€™s hands of the political realities of sponsored travel is the problem especially with influencers and bloggers who lack the editorial firewall traditional publications have.
Itâ€™s why when I asked on a recent survey if people trust bloggers who take a lot of paid trips 85% said no.
In another recent study only 4% said they trust online influencers.
So prevalent are the hashtags #ad and #sponsored that people tune them out.
Sure there have always been paid trips but I feel thereâ€™s less of a sense of ethics among modern travel influencers.
Looking back on the early days of blogging I feel there were lines we wouldnâ€™t cross â€” mostly because we were travelers too and we had an idea about the context of the trips we were on.
But now thereâ€™s more money floating around as millions of dollars per year are thrown at influencers.
Iâ€™ve been offered huge sums to promote products I once got offered $15000 for a single blog post.
Itâ€™s hard to turn that down if you donâ€™t have another source of income.
Moreover social media didnâ€™t exist when most bloggers started and we had to rely solely on our blogs and in-person relationships.
Now with so many platforms so many people competing for gigs so much money out there and the feedback loop social media provides I think people are justifying morally dubious activities in a way that didnâ€™t happen in the past.
Yes traditional writers bemoaned us the same way Iâ€™m bemoaning influencersâ€? now but I donâ€™t remember standing en masse on peopleâ€™s rooftops in Greece going off trail to take pictures of flowers or hanging off ledges for the perfect shot the way I see people doing those things now.
Too much of todayâ€™s content is look at meâ€? not learn from me.â€? So what can be done? My advice for people who consume travel content is to avoid people who do things that arenâ€™t legal or ethical and donâ€™t paint a full picture of whatâ€™s happening in a country.
By glossing over thorny issues they make it more likely youâ€™ll think everything is fine and increase the risk of something going wrong.
Look for those who are sharing more than pretty photos.
Look for those doing things you the consumer can also do not just on a paid promotional trip because those are the ones who are going to be able to help you learn how to travel better in real life.
And my fellow creatives I urge you to consider the ethics of who sponsors your trip and to give your readers the most complete and accurate information.
Donâ€™t just feature glossy pictures.
We get it every place has wonderful people every place has beauty.
But some places require more in-depth context.
Some paid trips shouldnâ€™t be taken.
Because while special access and paid trips are fun they arenâ€™t as fun when the money received from them drips in the blood of the very citizens you are trying to highlight.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
I use them all the time.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.

There are far too many travel bloggers & influencers with dubious ethics.
It doesnâ€™t help that the platforms make it impossible to report things like undisclosed sponsored trips or illegal behavior like trespassing or unauthorized drone usage.
Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 239 pm I see people do so many illegal things for the â€˜gram.
Itâ€™s sickening.
Reply Kat S January 8 2020 at 1211 pm Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this.
I think they are incredibly on point.
I lived in Riyadh for ten summers when I was a child because my mother worked there and while I agree that itâ€™s a beautiful intriguing country to explore the red sand deserts are otherworldly in my memory I would not advocate travelers especially amateur travelers or solo female travelers to just go there.
For the same reason that one does not go to North Korea to sightsee.
Saudi may be openâ€? to tourism now but that doesnâ€™t automatically mean its culture and people are.
Anyway I donâ€™t want to make this too long but just to thank you for using your platform to educate & forewarn people.
We need more travel content like you instead of Instaperfect shots with no substance behind it! Reply Oli January 8 2020 at 115 pm I dont really agree.
The question is not so much who pays the bill for the trip but if we should promote countries like Saudi Arabia at all.
Because lets face the facts Even if bloggers pay the trips by themselves they can only earn commissions if they promote it.
So no matter if its a sponsored trip or not there is never a complete independence.
So the key question is Shall we promote Saudi Arabia or not? Thats definitely a tough question.
One one there are the reasons you have mentioned here on the other hand I would be believe that tourism would help the country to open up and modernize from within â€“ which is certainly a positive development.
On the other hand if those efforts to promote tourism fail then its likely that those positive reforms will not be continued.
Considering all that I as a blogger would propably also participate on a sponsored trip to Saudi Arabia though a lot.would depend on the fine print of the agreement.
Reply Sebrin January 8 2020 at 334 pm I think this is a great post incredibly well balanced.
Because if we believe all writers/bloggers have a voice we certainly must understand that the competition for being seen is what motivates a lot of decisions especially when theyâ€™re putting their lives/careers on the line to provide ppl with content.
But this does not allow them to play ignorant.
Their JOB is to provide their point of view yes but not an ignorant one.
An informed one that relays both sides so they not only have a well crafted argument but they create trust for their audience.
Reply Kirsten January 8 2020 at 1103 pm I would like to visit one day.
But I turned down the invite I received to visit on a trip paid for by the Saudi Govâ€™t for the reasons you talk about here and thanks for doing so.
While Iâ€™d like to support the people Iâ€™d want to find a way to do so which wasnâ€™t paid for and sponsored by a govâ€™t that kills jails and tortures members of the media and who view women as lesser citizens.
Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 237 pm Exactly! ð?™‚ Reply HERBERT PASTERNAK January 9 2020 at 350 pm A thought provoking article that deserves high praise.
Thank you Matt for going off the beaten path of topics and giving your reads something to think about.
Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 237 pm Thanks! Reply katherine banks January 9 2020 at 540 pm As bloggers I feel like we have a responsibility to be transparent and let our readers know that our experience is not necessarily the experience they will have.
Let them make an informed decision.
Reply Nicole January 10 2020 at 1159 am Totally agree with you that readers should be careful in choosing the types of contents to believe in.
For instance many photos these days have been so heavily edited that the readers might just get disappointed when they arrive at the actual destinations.
Personally Iâ€™m okay with reading press trips as they do provide insights especially to new offerings.
As long as the content offers a balanced views including risks and challenges is properly disclosed and not against any ethics I think Iâ€™m okayâ€¦.as I understand how content creators need to pay bills too.
Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 232 pm But the rub is that not all content offers balanced views.
A lot of what you see from sponsored content is extremely whitewashed.
No one wants to bite the hand that feeds them! Reply Nicole January 11 2020 at 1222 pm Thatâ€™s true.
Itâ€™s hard to be unbiased with a sponsored post.
Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s very important that the influencer choose carefully what types of jobs to take up like what youâ€™ve suggested.
ð?™‚ Reply Lula Sierra John January 10 2020 at 221 pm So pleased to see you stand for more than free travel.
Any trip by visitors to certain countries always makes a statement for that country but if itâ€™s paid for by that country it means theyâ€™re looking for approval.
There is no question that the approval has to include the politics too when you travel there its not just approval on their beautiful scenery.
Time we heard from more courageous people.
Reply Rachel Heller January 12 2020 at 1120 am I completely agree with you but I would also add that itâ€™s not just if the government pays for your trip.
Even if you paid for it yourself much of the tourism infrastructure is owned by the ruling class.
Youâ€™d be adding to their income which presumably reinforces their hold on power.
Until there is a truly independent tourism infrastructure e.g airbnb-type rooms in peopleâ€™s houses hotels run by middle-class people not part of the ruling family etc.
itâ€™s best not to travel there.
Which is really a shame because I would LOVE to see their UNESCO sites.
Reply Elisa January 12 2020 at 141 pm Great post! Totally agree .
As well even if you pay for your travel expenses you shouldnâ€™t travel in country where thereâ€™s a dictatorship or where women are treated as sub-humans and have no rights at all.
Some will say that tourists can offer a way of a different way of living to locals but Iâ€™m honestly not willing to come to terms with blatant human rights violations.
Expecially being a woman.
