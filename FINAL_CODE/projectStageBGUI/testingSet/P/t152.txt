Itâ€™s an important topic I canâ€™t adequately cover so I brought in an expert to share her advice for other women travelers to help cover the topics important and specific to them! In this monthâ€™s article she explores the double standards that come with solo female travel.
I rushed to the gate at Julius Nyerere Airport in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.
As the agent checked my passport he looked around me and perplexed asked if I was alone.
Iâ€™d just finished up four months of solo traveling up from South Africa one of the best and most enriching solo trips of my life and replied that yes I was alone.
Your husband lets you do that?â€? he asked incredulously.
I get it.
In Tanzania itâ€™s unthinkable for a woman especially in her late twenties like I was to travel alone.
I gently let him know that nobody letsâ€? me do anything and that Iâ€™m unmarried.
While I take pleasure in shifting paradigms when possible I still wonder what it would be like if I were a man.
How would I be perceived when I solo travel or write about it? How would people treat me differently? 1.
They wouldnâ€™t ask me whether or not my husband lets meâ€? travel alone.
From Tanzania to the Philippines Iâ€™ve been asked where my boyfriend or husband is.
I bet almost nobody would ask me if my girlfriend lets me travel alone if I were a man.
I wouldnâ€™t have to question whether or not I should lie about being single.
I wouldnâ€™t debate wearing a decoy wedding band.
My safety wouldnâ€™t be tied up in my singleness.
2.
They wouldnâ€™t question whether a boyfriend or daddy pays for my trips.
Is it so strange to believe that a woman can fund her own lifestyle? Why is there such a pervasive myth that women who travel solo are being bankrolled by someone? When I travel I pay for it and when I travel with my partner we split it 50/50.
I bet I wouldnâ€™t have to state that if I were a man though.
3.
People might ask when Iâ€™m planning to settle down but they wouldnâ€™t do it with such frequency and entitlement to the answer Maybe settling down with a white picket fence 2.5 kids and a dog named Spike used to be the norm but we have more mobility these days and the internet and too many people anyway.
So why is it so darn important to people that I eventually settle down? I think in a way itâ€™s saying Hey this was the only option I gave myself and now you have to follow suit.â€? For those who conform to expectations itâ€™s uncomfortable when others deviate from the norm especially women.
But Iâ€™m not worried about it.
If and when I choose Iâ€™ll do it and if I donâ€™t thatâ€™s OK too.
Iâ€™m approaching this more like a man OK? Also get out of my ovaries.
4.
Iâ€™d be called adventurous and an explorer rather than irresponsible and stupid.
If I traveled solo as a man even if something unfortunate happened to me Iâ€™d be called an explorer and lover of life.
Yet as a woman Iâ€™ve been called stupid warned Iâ€™d be found dead and cannibalizedâ€? and accused of leading other women to their death just look at the comments on this video the worst of which I actually deleted.
5.
I wouldnâ€™t be warned Iâ€™d get rapedâ€? if I traveled alone.
If I were a man Iâ€™d only have a 6.6% chance of being told Iâ€™d get rapedâ€? if I travel alone versus nearly 70% as a woman.
This is problematic on so many levels it deserves its own post.
6.
Iâ€™d be able to wear what I want.
In some places I canâ€™t wear what I want.
I understand that modesty is built into the culture in many places around the world and I respect it and assimilate when in those countries.
But that doesnâ€™t mean I have to pretend that I enjoy wearing long sleeves and pants in 90-degree weather with 90% humidity while the boys get to wear shorts and tank tops.
7.
I wouldnâ€™t have had to wonder what the hell to do when cornered in an elevator in Santiago by two big men saying salacious things to me in Spanish.
When I traveled through Patagonia with a male friend nobody harassed me assuming I wasnâ€™t available.
Yet when we parted ways so that I could solo travel â€” something that was important to me to do â€” the catcalls started pouring in.
Sadly Iâ€™ve been catcalled in almost every country that Iâ€™ve been to even the ones youâ€™d least expect yet not at all in southern and eastern Africa â€” points for Africa!.
It ranges from ciao bellaâ€? to being chased down the sidewalk.
It is not a compliment itâ€™s an assertion of power and itâ€™s exhausting.
In Santiago it crossed the line into terrifying when two huge guys got into an elevator with me hovered over me and harassed me.
It was the perfect place because who could help me in there? Would that have happened to a man? On the positive side if I were a man locals might not be as concerned with taking care of me as many are.
People might also not trust me outright the way they do.
Right or wrong women tend to be perceived as more peaceful and gentle and in need of protection.
8.
Nobody would have assaulted me in public in Nepal.
In Pokhara Nepal after a random power cut the sun was setting and I realized I needed water to drink to get through the evening.
Though I prefer not to walk alone when it gets dark I had to do so in that instance.
I heard myself scream before realizing that a local male had grabbed my breast.
I whirled around and saw nothing but the back of his head as he ran away like the coward he is.
Everyone nearby just pretended like they hadnâ€™t seen anything of course.
9.
But maybe the police would have taken me more seriously.
I wonder if Iâ€™d been a man demanding the police take notice would they have listened to me? Would the officer still have rolled his eyes and acted like I was ruining his night by demanding an escort back to my guesthouse? I can only wonder if it would have been different.
10.
Insulting my ass would not be the topic of discussion on a post about road trips.
When women share about something like travel on social media why is body shaming still a thing? Why on a post about road trips of all things does someone feel the need to inform me that my ass is flat? Does that happen to guys too? I think not.
11.
I wouldnâ€™t have had an internet stalker demand a naked selfie from me for months on all of my social platforms.
If being a solo female traveler is tough at times try writing about it.
Have any of my male peers ever been harassed for months on end on every platform by a stalker demanding a naked selfie? Unfortunately women are targeted online way more than men.
According to the BBC one in three teenage girls have been sexually harassed online.
Why canâ€™t we just share our travel pictures in peace? 12.
I wouldnâ€™t get a flood of comments from fragile males on posts like this.
It always happens but Iâ€™m curious Why should any egalitarian male who has the ability to see things from someone elseâ€™s perspective ever take this personally? Why does pointing out issues in our society automatically equate to blaming men? Louder for the ones in the back it doesnâ€™t.
*** Obviously there are drawbacks for male solo travelers too â€” and benefits that only women who travel solo get to enjoy.
There can be an implied trust factor between women that transcends cultures and time and time again people have been generous towards me in ways that I didnâ€™t expect.
In the end I still love and champion solo female travel and believe that every woman should do it.
Iâ€™m just sick of all the double standards and think itâ€™s high time to call them out.

No idea if men get asked this.
Reply Lynna February 20 2020 at 613 pm And it doesnâ€™t stop as you get older.
Now when I tell them my husband isnâ€™t with me because I am a widow I am asked about my sons not my daughters.
Reply kristin addis February 21 2020 at 1213 pm Gosh thatâ€™s so annoying! Reply Kathleen February 21 2020 at 132 am I couldnâ€™t agree more with all of this â€“ especially the comments about your dad must be rich!â€? your dad lets you do this?!â€? Iâ€™m 34 years old thanks.
No one bankrolls me or lets me do anything â€“ I just do what I want to do because Iâ€™m an independent adult! Itâ€™s a weird infantilisation.
Reply kristin addis February 21 2020 at 1213 pm Yeah..
maybe Iâ€™m rich or just thrifty.
Maybe Iâ€™m self-made.
Thatâ€™s an option! Reply Mike February 21 2020 at 950 am You raised some really good points and respectfully so.
Iâ€™ve seen it all travelling with my wife.
When Iâ€™m 10 feet away and out of view it makes my stomach curdle to see how she is treated.
When sheâ€™s dealing with immigration to leave the Phillipines her home country â€“she hears almost everything you mentioned in one conversation plus sometimes getting hit on.
And then she points to the white guy and suddenly all is well.
My instinct is to defend her but she wonâ€™t have it.
So many countries are like this travelling with an ex from Thailand to Singapore they questioned her for 20 minutes to ensure she wasnâ€™t a prostitute.
Which means they thought I was a trafficker.
Made my heart hurt.
Women are higher value than men in most cultures.
It comes with a price tag and ugly ignorance.
On the flip side I appreciate the culture of where my lady is from warts and all for who my wife became because of it.
Because of it she understands there are monsters everywhere.
Tourism is a party no one is really invited to some people express bad vibes immediately once they sense youâ€™re a tourist regardless of gender although it manifests in different ways.
Women get the worst treatment.
These same challenges we decry make some of us strong.
They probably made you strong â€“albeit frustrated and rightly so.
But they made you better for it.
Glass half full not saying any of this is acceptable but the benefit is that youâ€™re likely much tougher and street smart than you were when you started out and thatâ€™s useful for the rest of your life.
As a guy living in Asia for 10 years I too can relate to these problems.
But I know this isnâ€™t the time to bring it up.
Iâ€™m not told over and over that these things can happen to me I donâ€™t get d-bag warnings like you but the things they warn you of have literally happened to me.
Even the stuff that doesnâ€™t normally happen to most men.
Awful stuff.
No confessions for this comment but I think you know what Iâ€™m saying.
But what really got me in the heart strings was that you also said this Obviously there are drawbacks for male solo travelers too â€” and benefits that only women who travel solo get to enjoy.
There can be an implied trust factor between women that transcends cultures and time and time again people have been generous towards me in ways that I didnâ€™t expect.â€? I understand women truly do get the shorter end of the stick in global travel â€“but most articles shut down the male perspective immediately or blame them for all woes you didnâ€™t do that.
Thanks for writing such a thoughtful article and not putting all men down.
All in all I am left with the feeling that youâ€™re a better writer than I and youâ€™re able to empathise with men at a time when they need it too while articulating what you mean without adding popular rhetoric.
In one way or another weâ€™re all up against hundreds of thousands of years of culture and biology.
Itâ€™s not one society itâ€™s many societies and each have their differences.
Itâ€™s amazing to me that present day America can exist at the same time as present day Saudi Arabia.
I hope that mention gets linked to Mattâ€™s article on influencer marketing for Saudi Arabia.
To wrap it up â€“although Iâ€™m not a wokeâ€? person I am aware empathetic and I do what I can to bring about a correctionâ€? to the woes you listed here.
Thanks for making an article I can really stand behind Kristin as a man.
Well expressed and a true reality for solo female travellers.
A lesson and a warning.
Reply Steven February 23 2020 at 500 am Yes men sometimes get asked about kids when travelling.
It happened to me yesterday in Morocco.
And there have been times when because I said I wasnâ€™t married Iâ€™m in my 40s it was assumed that I was gay.
And that was in France! But no question women have it rougher in Islamic countries not done Asia or South America yet.
And not just wandering women.
The locals seem to have it just as bad.
Reply Lia February 23 2020 at 457 pm Are you kidding me.
This western perspective irks me.
You get in Tanzania for a day and now you know how Tanzania women are allowed to do or not do.
Iâ€™m Tanzanian and itâ€™s not unheard of single girls travelling alone.
People are people they are curious when they see something that doesnâ€™t fit the norm.
Even in America I have been asked where is your boyfriend.
This kind of narrative tries to subconsciously portray developing countries as if they are stuck and legging behind.
Reply Mika March 4 2020 at 1120 am I too have experienced the same comments about Where is your husband/boyfriend?â€?.
In one country this young girl asked me my age I believe she was curious how I afforded to travel solo.
Even in a group of three young females in Italy we were treated differently when we traveled with a male v when we were just three young females.
Many males donâ€™t understand the challenges single solo travelers face.
Thank you for sharing and educating others.
Reply Christine March 4 2020 at 251 pm Thatâ€™s why I believe that more women from a variety of cultures and backgrounds need to travel independently.
Exposure can over time change sexist ideas about how women move through the world.
It can also empower others to see someone like themselves traveling independently.
