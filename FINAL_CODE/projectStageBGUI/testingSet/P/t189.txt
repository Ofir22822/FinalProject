Posted 04/25/19 | April 25th 2019 Once considered one of the deadliest cities in the world MedellÃ­n has undergone a transformation over the last fifteen years that has made it one of the most modern places in all of Colombia.
The city has become a lot safer there is a fantastic metro and cable car system that could rival the best in Europe lots of parks new buildings libraries restaurants and a growing tech scene.
The city has changed a lot and you can tell the residents are very proud of everything theyâ€™ve accomplished.
Thereâ€™s a palpable sense of possibility in Medellin.
Optimism and excitement were always in the air.
MedellÃ­n is now one of itâ€? cities in the world.
Tourists swarm it and foreigners especially young digital nomads are settling and retiring here in droves.
It was the most cosmopolitan and international city I visited in Colombia.
I spent close to a total of three weeks in MedellÃ­n.
If youâ€™re looking to visit MedellÃ­n and I donâ€™t see why you wouldnâ€™t be if youâ€™re in Colombia here is a list of my favorite things to do and see after spending so much time there 1.
Explore the Numerous Parks and Plazas MedellÃ­nâ€™s year-round temperate climate makes it a perfect place to spend a lot of time outdoors where people are always lounging around and vendors are peddling food and drinks.
Two must-visit parks are Plaza Botero â€“ Botero is a famous artist from Medellin known for his drawing and statues of oversized people.
This plaza is home to 23 Botero sculptures and is always packed with people taking photos street performers and artists.
Located in the Old Quarter youâ€™ll find a couple of museums in the square too.
Parque Lleras â€“ Located right in the center of Poblado this park is full of people all day and night.
There are street vendors food sellers musicians and people drinking into the wee hours of the night.
Itâ€™s a wonderful place to people-watch and one of the best places to have fun in the city! 2.
Wander Parque Arvi This park is worthy of its own entry.
Located in the mountains near the city you can take the gondola right from the subway to the parkâ€™s entrance.
Itâ€™s a beautiful ride through the hills and offers some incredible views of the valley and city.
The park spans 16000 hectares and includes trails that date back over 1500 years.
At the park entrance youâ€™ll find a small market as well as trails to hike.
To visit you now have to take a guided tour.
It costs 5000-7000 COP $1.50-2.25 USD depending on the trail most trails are 2-4km long.
Bird-watching tours are also available.
3.
Explore JardÃ­n BotÃ¡nico The botanical gardens a quiet retreat from the noise and chaos of the city host numerous events concerts and festivals throughout the year.
They cover over 14 hectares and are home to around 4500 flowers and some 139 different bird species.
Thereâ€™s also a nice if not overpriced restaurant in the center if you feel like spending more time here relaxing and taking in the scene.
4.
See a Soccer Match Soccer futbol here is religion and if there are games when youâ€™re here you should really try to see one.
MedellÃ­n has two local teams AtlÃ©tico Nacional and Independiente MedellÃ­n.
Supporters of each team occupy bleachers at opposing ends of the stadium since things tend to get rowdy and violent when they are near each other.
Ticket prices are well under 40000 COP under $12.50 USD.
5.
Take a Day Trip to GuatapÃ© GuatapÃ© is the most popular day-trip destination from MedellÃ­n.
Itâ€™s a colorful pueblo village situated on the edge of a lake about two hours from town and itâ€™s possible to take tours of the surrounding area by speedboat or party boat which is very popular with backpackers who spend a night or two here.
The main attraction is El PeÃ±ol a granite monolith with over 700 concrete stairs etched in its side.
For a few thousand pesos visitors can climb to the top for breathtaking 360-degree views of the region.
GuatapÃ© is a long day trip from MedellÃ­n hostels in the city organize trips throughout the week so I recommend trying to spend at least a night here so you arenâ€™t rushed and can enjoy the area little more.
6.
Take a Free Walking Tour One of my favorite things to do when I get to a new city is to take a free walking tour.
Theyâ€™re perfect for getting an overview of a place while giving you access to a local expert who can answer your questions.
Real City Walking Tours has a great free tour that will give you an informative introduction to the city.
Donâ€™t do any other tours this is the only free walking tour you need and itâ€™s the best in town.
Youâ€™ll get a lot of information and the guides are wonderful.
Be sure to tip at the end! 7.
Tour Comuna 13 This area was once the most violent part of MedellÃ­n.
Murder drugs and violent crime were rampant itâ€™s still not a safe area to visit at night.
You used to have to go through guards to get into this area if you didnâ€™t live here you werenâ€™t let in.
However thanks to its street art which was a reaction to heavy-handed police raids there has been a huge influx of tourists.
That has made part of the area safer and led to a rise in business and commerce.
Itâ€™s really changed the fabric of the community.
Local residents are even coming here now figuring that if the tourists are going it must be good! You can visit by yourself or go on a tour where a guide will explain the history of the area and the artists.
Some of the better tour companies are Comuna 13 Graffiti Tour comuna13tours.com Zippy Tour zippytourcomuna13.jimdo.com MedellÃ­n City Tours medellincitytours.com 8.
Visit the Museo de Antioquia Founded in 1881 this interesting museum is home to numerous pre-Colombian works as well as national and international works by famous artists there are a bunch of Boteros here too and a wide variety of photographs and sculptures.

9.
Wander the Cementerio Museo de San Pedro Built in 1842 this cemetery is also a museum where you can see the monuments and graves of many famous Colombians while learning about their lives and contributions.
Thereâ€™s a lot of large marble mausoleums and statues here.
Keep an eye out for special events such as midnight tours and movie nights.
The cemetery is small but itâ€™s also close to the botanical gardens so you can do both one after the other.
Cra.
51 #68-68 +57 4-516-7650 cementeriosanpedro.org.co.
Open daily 730am-530pm.
Admission is free.
10.
See the Casa de la Memoria This museum opened in 2012 and examines the history of armed conflict in Colombia.
It sheds light on the struggles the people of Colombia have had to overcome to get where they are today.
Itâ€™s a very sobering and solemn place but it offers some important insights.
Donâ€™t miss it.
Parque Bicentenario +57 4-520-2020 museocasadelamemoria.gov.co.
Open Tuesday-Friday 9am-6pm and weekends 10am-4pm.
Admission is free and there is also a free audio guide you can download.
Guided tours are available on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Contact the museum for details.
11.
Visit the Museo de Arte Moderno The Museum of Modern Art located in a refurbished industrial building is an awesome work of art in itself.
Thereâ€™s a ton of exposed area giving it a really charming feel.
Many people have a love-hate relationship with modern art itâ€™s not my personal favorite I admit but even I enjoyed my visit here.
The collection is small but thereâ€™s also a beautiful photography section on the bottom floor.
Even if itâ€™s not your thing itâ€™s worth spending a couple hours here to get a sense of the modern art scene in the city.
Cra.
44 #19a-100 +57 4-444-2622 elmamm.org.
Open Tuesday-Friday 9am-6pm on Saturdays 10am-6pm and Sundays 10am-5pm.
Admission is 12000 COP $4 USD per person.
12.
Take a Food Tour If youâ€™re looking to taste a sample of what MedellÃ­nâ„¢ has to offer there are a couple of food tour companies that can help.
Itâ€™s a great way to get a taste for the local cuisine while learning about the countryâ€™s traditions in the process.
There are plenty of options such as street food tours from Toucan CafÃ© or more traditional local restaurant tours from MedellÃ­n City Tours.
Both are good options! Expect to pay 143000-28600 COP $45-90 USD per person.
13.
Visit a Microbrewery If you find yourself parched after an afternoon of sampling the cityâ€™s delicious cuisine consider taking a brewery or craft beer tour to quench your thirst.
There is an up-and-coming craft beer scene in Colombia and MedellÃ­n has over 30 breweries and microbreweries.
These are some of the best places to try a local beer 3 Cordilleras runs tours Thursday and Friday evenings offering five samples for 25000-30000 COP $8-10 USD per person.
Cerveza Premium ApÃ³stol has a tour every Thursday at 630pm where you can see the brewery taste a few drinks and enjoy a snack in the process.
Advanced booking is required and tickets are 35000 COP $11 USD per person.
20 Mission Cerveza has great beer great food and itâ€™s a fun place to hang out and meet people.
They offer tours of the brewery and they also host music events and DJs.
Itâ€™s super popular and one of the best places in town to grab a beer.
Brew House is a family-owned-and-operated brewery where you can take a tour and sample the offerings alongside their full pub menu.
MedellÃ­n Beer Factory doesnâ€™t offer tours though it does brew its own beer with over 50 kinds on the menu! Itâ€™s a great place to relax with friends.
14.
Visit Comuna 8 Much like Comuna 13 this area was one of the poorest in MedellÃ­n â€” and it still is.
This district was really isolated until the city built a gondola from downtown allowing people to get to work a lot more easily.
La Sierra runs a tour to teach people about the history of the area and unlike Comuna 13 itâ€™s not overrun with tourists.
Itâ€™s a small district and the tour doesnâ€™t last long but you get a much more authentic look at the city and its people and history than you do in Comuna 13 where the focus is more on street art.
I highly recommend it it was one of the most insightful experiences I had in MedellÃ­n.
Finally Donâ€™t Do the Escobar Tour! The locals here are not fans of Pablo Escobar.
His violent life and legacy caused untold amounts of harm to the city and its population and while itâ€™s always good to learn about the history of a destination glorifying this is not something I want to support.
You can learn about his life online in a way that doesnâ€™t spit in the face of the locals many of whom donâ€™t even speak his name.
Out of respect for them I encourage you to skip the Escobar tour.
Where to Eat in MedellÃ­n I ate a lot in this city â€” and it was amazing! Here are some highlights Mondongo â€“ Traditional Colombian food in a relaxed atmosphere.
Try the mondongo a traditional tripe soup.
It comes with a ton of side dishes including giant avocados.
Come early as this place get packed.
Try to avoid the weekend.
Cl.
10 #38-38 Carmen â€“ High-end gastronomy with some of the best food in all of Colombia.
Itâ€™s expensive but worth it.
It was the best splurge meal I had in the country.
Cra.
36 #10a-27 Mercado del Rio â€“ An awesome food court offering all sorts of delicious food from dozens of vendors.
Thereâ€™s something for everyone here.
Cl.
24 #48-28 20 Mission â€“ A great microbrewery with delicious food too! Try the IPA.
Cl.
16 #43f-66 Pergamino CafÃ© â€“ A chill cafÃ© with some of the best coffee in town.
I spent a lot of time working here.
They make great breakfast food BLTs and empenadadas.
Cra.
37 #8A-37 37 Park â€“ Another great bar and restaurant with a rustic outdoor garden.
Cra.
37 #8A â€“ 4 Hatoviejo â€“ This is one of the best places to get traditional Colombian food.
Itâ€™s pricey when compared to some of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants youâ€™ll find throughout town.
Cl.
16 #28-60 *** I was never bored in MedellÃ­n.
In a country full of hype this hyped-up city is all that itâ€™s cracked up to be.
It has enough activities to fill weeks on end.
Combined with the low cost of travel and living itâ€™s no wonder more and more people are visiting the city.
This guide can help you plan your trip.
And while itâ€™s easy to get lost in Gringoland here try to get out of Poblado or Laureles and see the localsâ€™ side of town.
Thatâ€™s where the magic of MedellÃ­n happens.

I used to look down my nose at tipicoâ€? but now I find it delicious.
Chicken breast or steak or chicharrones with rice salad soup banana or plantain slice and a drink for 12000 COP $4USD.
And I canâ€™t usually finish the meal so I have a snack or dinner for later.
We retired here in May 2018 and have no desire to leave.
Reply Anita April 27 2019 at 907 am I would be intersted to try the foods and beers.
To be honest I havenâ€™t tried any beers from this country.
And yeah If I even go there promise to donâ€™t go to Pablo Escobar tour ð?˜‰ Reply Tyler Johnson May 21 2019 at 1238 pm Thatâ€™s a good idea to take a food tour in Medellin.
I would think that would be a great way to try some foods that I canâ€™t get at home.
I am thinking about taking a trip through a bunch of places in South America and Iâ€™ll have to think about taking a food tour if I decide to go through Medellin.
Reply Robert May 28 2019 at 711 pm Great tips thanks for sharing! I would mention one important issue about medellin.
The air quality is terrible so if you have respiratory issues you probably want to avoid this destination.
Reply Steven Tuggle January 23 2020 at 704 pm The air quality is only bad at certain times of the year when the winds wonâ€™t blow it North or South out of the valley.
At other times the air is very clear and the views are spectacular.
Reply Leigh August 1 2019 at 1035 pm I just got back from a 3 week holiday in Colombia of which 6 days were spent in MedellÃ­n which is arguably my favourite city! Thanks Matt for all of your suggestions especially the Comuna 23 tour with Zippy Tours and the free city tour with Real City Tours.
They were both superb!! During the city tour it took us to El Centro and Botero park.
Unfortunately we didnâ€™t get a chance to do the museums this time around and I had done a food tour in Cartagena so I decided to give it a miss in MedellÃ­n.
Can I suggest for your top places to eat to include Verdeo a top notch vegetarian restaurant even the non-vegetarians will enjoy I guarantee! Happy travels Matt! Reply Tejpaal April 11 2020 at 1127 am Am vegetarian + eggs & fruits are okay can I get choices of food in Columbia or itâ€™s difficult & only non veg food available ?? Pls updates me Reply Camille February 16 2020 at 635 pm Great suggestions Matt.
Also appreciate your disclaimer on the Escobar tours.
Not many bloggers mention this.
I recently moved to MedellÃ­n & have found tours through Airbnb experiences to be some of the best.
Highly recommend folks looking into them for local experiences.
Reply Camilo March 10 2020 at 329 pm Great tips! but u forgot to visit the Parque Explora it is next to the JardÃ­n BotÃ¡nico.
