Itâ€™s a city home to hippies techies artists immigrants students and everyone in between.
Thereâ€™s incredible music wold-class food for all budgets some of the BEST Asian food in the country parks galore and amazing bohemian vibe to it.
With so many diverse influences itâ€™s no surprise that San Francisco has evolved into a world-class city that has a ton of amazing things to see and do.
Personally I love visiting San Francisco for the food.
Itâ€™s home to some of the best Asian and Mexican food in the country as well as some incredible cafes.
But there is also much more to see here too.
And just because itâ€™s an expensive place to live doesnâ€™t mean a visit has to break the bank either.
To help you plan your trip here are the best 28 things to see and do in San Francisco 1.
Take a Free Walking Tour The first thing I do whenever I arrive in a new destination is to take a walking tour.
Itâ€™s the best way to get the lay of the land see the highlights and ask your questions to an expert local guide.
Free Tours By Foot has a few different FREE options available covering different areas of the city.
Just make sure to tip your guide If you want something more in-depth there are also plenty of paid tours you can take.
Take Walks is my go-to walking tour company and they offer some interesting tours around the city.
If you want to really learn a lot while having fun book a tour with them! 2.
Walk the Golden Gate Bridge There is no question that the iconic Golden Gate Bridge is one of San Franciscoâ€™s most famous landmarks.
Opened in 1937 itâ€™s arguably the most-photographed bridge in the world.
At its inception it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world spanning 4200 feet 1280m long and standing 746 feet 227m tall.
You can walk across the bridge which I recommended or just stare at it from every angle and snap your own iconic photos.
If you have time make your way to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
It has a waterfront promenade sweeping views of the bridge and a few easy hiking trails.
3.
Visit Crissy Field This park is located near the bridge and makes for a nice follow-up.
It has a beach some restaurants piers where you can see locals fishing and plenty of green space to relax.
It offers some sweeping views of the harbor making it a laid-back place to come in the summer to have a picnic lounge in the sun and watch life go by.
4.
See The Palace of Fine Arts The Palace of Fine Arts is a Roman-style remnant of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition a worldâ€™s fair held in San Francisco.
The outdoor rotunda and its lagoon are another one of the cityâ€™s most photographed sights.
Itâ€™s also a fun social destination where you can bring friends to play giant Jenga cornhole ping pong and other games.

Wander Fishermanâ€™s Wharf and Pier 39 The wharf was originally dominated by Italian immigrants who helped popularize the cityâ€™s fish market.
To this day you can watch fishermen at work in Fish Alley the main street where the fishermen work.
If you want to try some of the mouthwatering seafood that San Francisco is famous for I sugged Waterbar and the Anchor Oyster Bar.
Pier 39 is touristy but itâ€™s also a fun way to spend an hour or so.
There are buskers tacky souvenir shops arcades an aquarium and tons of overpriced restaurants so avoid eating here.
6.
Explore Alcatraz Alcatraz is probably the most famous or infamous prison in America.
From 1934-1963 it housed the countryâ€™s most notorious criminals criminals like Al Capone.
In its 29 year history not a single prisoner successfully escaped or so they say.
After its closure it became a national landmark.
Visitors can explore the island learn about the prison and what life was like as an inmate and tour the interior.
It gets very busy in the summer so be sure to book ahead.

If youâ€™re a history buff donâ€™t miss the MisiÃ³n San Francisco de AsÃ­s Mission Dolores.
Founded in 1776 itâ€™s the oldest surviving structure in the city and home to the only cemetery within city limits.
Itâ€™s the structure that gives this part of town its name.
The Mission District is also a fun place to spend a night out.
The district has tons of great Mexican restaurants as well as lively bars and clubs.
Grab a burrito at Taqueria CancÃºn or Papolete or visit one of the cocktail bars on 16th Dalva is good.
9.
See Lombard Street This is the worldâ€™s windiest street.
Surrounded by gardens and flowers itâ€™s made up of eight hairpin turns because during the 1920s people in San Francisco were beginning to drive around in automobiles.
However many of the cityâ€™s famous hills were too steep to navigate.
The idea of using a curved street to help vehicles move downhill was embraced and the hillâ€™s slope went from 27% to 16%.
Now you can watch the cars and bikers navigate the sharp turns as tourists gawk at them.
10.
Visit Coit Tower Perched atop Telegraph Hill this art deco tower was built in 1933.

Chinese immigrants first came to the West Coast in the 1850s and set up shop in San Francisco.
Due to racial segregation this neighborhood became predominantly Chinese and remained so even after segregation ended.
