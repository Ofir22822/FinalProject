Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Tropical jungles bursting with wildlife mountainous landscapes extending into the horizon picture-perfect beaches on both sides of the country and a never-ending supply of fun activities no matter your budget.
Costa Rica is a nature-loverâ€™s paradise â€” and itâ€™s one of my favorite countries in the world too.
It was the first country I ever traveled to and it was the country that sparked my wanderlust.
The beaches feel like paradise thereâ€™s great surfing diving and plenty of places to get away from the hordes of retired Americans that live here.
No matter what your interest there are tons of things to see and do in Costa Rica without breaking the bank.
But is Costa Rica safe to visit? The country was fortunate to escape the Cold War conflicts and brutal gang violence that impacted other countries in Central America.
However in recent years Costa Rica has become more involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.
But the country is super safe for tourists.
At worst youâ€™ll get scammed for a few bucks.
I mean the country is so safe it doesnâ€™t even have an army! While Costa Rica is one of the safest countries for travel and backpacking in Central America that doesnâ€™t mean you should let your guard down.
Here are some tips to guarantee a safe and stress-free experience 1.
Avoid isolated areas â€“ If youâ€™re somewhere isolated youâ€™ll be at a greater risk for getting robbed especially at night and in big cities.
Try to stay where the crowds are.
Thatâ€™s the best way to avoid being singled out by potential muggers.
2.
Donâ€™t wear flashy items â€“ Petty theft is common here so remove any jewelry or watches and donâ€™t wave your phone around.
Do your best to blend in so you donâ€™t become a target for pickpockets.
If you happen to find yourself a victim of a robbery follow the instructions of the robber and give up your valuables these material items can be replaced but your life cannot.
3.
Donâ€™t leave your items unattended â€“ If you are spending the day on the beaches in Puerto Viejo Santa Theresa or Manuel Antonio do not leave your belongings unattended while swimming or walking along the sand locals or tourists alike can easily take your valuables if you leave them around.
Just take what you need with you and nothing more.
4.
Be alert when using public transportation â€“ Petty theft including bag snatching is the most common type of crime youâ€™ll face in Costa Rica.
Most of the theft in Costa Rica occurs while taking the bus.
Keep your bag containing valuables and identification on your lap and stay vigilant.
5.
Always take an authorized taxi â€“ Crimes against cab riders are infrequent here but itâ€™s best you use a licensed taxi.
Also pay close attention to the meter and make sure itâ€™s running.
Cab drivers can turn the meter off and claim itâ€™s broken a common scam see below.
6.
Buy travel insurance â€“ This is especially important if you plan to join in on activities like ziplining white water rafting or surfing.
Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70.
For more information on tarvel insurance check out these posts What Does Travel Insurance ACTUALLY Cover? The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance How to Avoid Scams in Costa Rica There are really only two common scams found in Costa Rica 1.
Taxi Scam You hop into a taxi and realize the meter isnâ€™t running.
You mention this to the driver and their response is the meter is brokenâ€? and quotes you a price that is outrageously high.
Or you might notice that the meter is working but the fare is increasing faster than a running cheetah.
Do your research and get an idea of how much a ride should cost from your hostel or hotel staff before hailing a taxi.
In my experience if the cabbie tries to negotiate the rate I use the rate quoted to me and if they refuse I get out and find someone who will turn the meter on.
If the meter looks as though itâ€™s rising unusually fast ask the driver to pull over and get out immediately.
2.
The Cheap Tourâ€? Scam Youâ€™re exploring the sites and sounds of the city and a well-mannered nicely dressed person approaches you and asks if youâ€™re looking to go on a tour.
They do a fantastic job describing the most unforgettable trip youâ€™ll ever take in your life and at a fraction of the cost of other tour companies.
Youâ€™re sold and hand them a deposit.
You wait the next day for them to pick you up but no one shows up.
You realize there was no amazing tour at 50% less youâ€™d been tricked.
To avoid this scam only use authorized companies when booking tours.
Your hostel/hotel can always help you and if you plan to book through a tour company check their online reviews ahead of time.
Never trust someone trying to sell you a tour on the street who does not have an official office or storefront.
These scams are the most common ones youâ€™ll face while in Costa Rica.
If youâ€™re worried about scams read this post on travel scams to avoid.
Avoiding travel scams requires a lot of common sense and a healthy dose of suspicion.
Zika Risk in Costa Rica While there are no reports of a Zika outbreak in the country Costa Rica has had reported cases of the Zika virus.
While risks are low travelers are advised to take the following precautions Use mosquito repellent on your body to prevent bites and sleep under a mosquito net to avoid getting bit while when youâ€™re asleep Wear breathable garments that cover your arms and legs if youâ€™re wondering what you should apply first apply sunscreen first followed by repellent.
Keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to prevent mosquitos from entering your room Pregnant women or couples considering pregnancy should consult a healthcare practitioner prior to travel FAQ on Costa Rica Safety Here are the most common questions I get asked about staying safe in Costa Rica and my answers to them Is Street Food in Costa Rica Safe? In Costa Rica street food is safe to eat and not to be missed! Iâ€™ve had my fair share of empanadas fresh fruits from open markets and other local foods and have been perfectly fine.
That being said if something doesnâ€™t look cooked through such as chicken or has been out in the sun for too long then trust your gut and donâ€™t eat it.
But I would encourage you to try the street food as itâ€™s the best way to experience the cuisine and support local businesses plus itâ€™s cheap! Is the Tap Water Safe to Drink in Costa Rica? The tap water in Costa Rica is safe to drink however itâ€™s recommended that you avoid drinking the tap water in most beach destinations.
The best way to make sure your drinking water is safe is to bring a SteriPen or LifeStraw for your reusable water bottle.
This way youâ€™ll be able to purify the tap water so you donâ€™t get sick â€” and avoid using single-use plastic bottles in the process.
Are Taxis in Costa Rica Safe? The taxis in Costa Rica are safe and reliable though youâ€™ll always want to make sure youâ€™re getting in an authorized taxi.
During the day you can hail a taxi from the street safely but make sure you pay attention that the meter is turned on and running properly.
If youâ€™re taking a taxi at night itâ€™s best to have your accommodation call it for you.
That will ensure you get a reputable company.
Never hail a random taxi at night.
As mentioned earlier taxi drivers will occasionally try to take advantage of travelers by overcharging them.
Always remain alert and if anything feels suspicious ask the driver to stop the cab and get out.
Donâ€™t take any chances with your safety.

They went ziplining for the first time and seemed like it was very fun.
When they went to a zoo a monkey known as the spider-monkey used its tail to knock the phone off of my head and hit him a couple of times through the fence that it was being held in.
I actually sent them the link to this before they went over to Costa Rica but whether or not they actually looked at it is beyond me but thanks anyway for making this keeping me well informed if I ever go there someday! Reply Diego February 28 2020 at 1109 am Great post as always! ð?™‚ Costa Rica is definitely a safe country but it is better to take some precautions.
Keep your eyes open if you are visiting San Jose or Jaco.

March 10 2020 at 1140 pm Sadly Costa Rica has been experiencing major crime increases.
It now carries a Level 2 Warning from the US State Department.
Drug trafficking gangs drug usage missing females and of course the petty crimes that come with any 3rd World country.
There has been an influx of criminal groups from neighboring countries that have brought this increase in crime with them.
Iâ€™m a gringo who lives in San Jose with my wife and two boys.
I enjoy Costa Rica but it has changed for the worse.
It is extremely exasperating that the government keeps many things quiet as to not disrupt the tourist industry.
This gives both locals and tourits a false sense of safety.
