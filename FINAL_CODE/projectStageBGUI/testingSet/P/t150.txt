Posted 02/06/20 | February 6th 2020 At the end of 2019 the team and I ran a reader survey.
We wanted to see what you liked didnâ€™t like and wanted from us in the future.
There were some interesting and helpful suggestions in there.
I read through over a thousand responses as I wanted to see what you wanted from us.
You canâ€™t get better without feedback and we always want to make sure weâ€™re serving your needs.
So as we make our way through this year I wanted to share with you some changes you can expect to see on the website First weâ€™re continuing to bring on new voices to write for us.
You might have noticed that weâ€™re having more guest posts to more destinations! Weâ€™re currently looking for articles about LGBT content stories by transgender people queer couples and solo gay lesbian or bi travelers Africa-related content bonus points if itâ€™s East or Central Africa Middle Eastâ€“related content Central Asiaâ€“related content India-related content China-related content Technology- or gear-related content Senior/Older travel Family travel If you want to write for us check out our guidelines page.
Second I plan to write more travel stories this year.
We do a lot of brass-tacks hard-numbers stuff here.
The nuts and bolts of travel.
Practical information.
But last year writing my book inspired me to get into more storytelling.
So this year as I make my way around the world Iâ€™m making an effort to create more stories about the places I visit â€” their history people and culture.
So youâ€™ll see such content popping up with more frequency.
And youâ€™ll see more history and culture in our how-to posts too.
I want to start painting a more holistic view of each destination we write about.
Third weâ€™re going to be hosting a lot more events this year.
Weâ€™ve started The Nomadic Network so we can do more in-person events this year.
We really want to take this online community offline so weâ€™re building a great website for that and hosting lots of events.
For more information and ways you can get involved check this post out.
Fourth a lot of you suggested topics you wanted to see so weâ€™re busy making that happen! Some of the topics youâ€™ll start to see more of over the course of the year are Eco-travel Traveling with pets Family/kid-friendly travel Traveling when youâ€™re older How to make friends when you travel How to make the most of your time How to save more money BEFORE you go Off-beat destinations Thematicâ€? ways to see a city Reader stories Ways to volunteer Itinerary posts And a bunch more! Obviously I canâ€™t write all the time or expertly on all these topics which is why weâ€™re going to be bringing in a few more regular contributors and writers now.
So not only will you be seeing more content youâ€™ll be seeing a lot more diverse voices on the website too.
And as a sidebar to that since we have so much content now weâ€™re going to be doing a new redesign in the middle of the year so the site will be easier to navigate.
Thatâ€™s it! Those are our big plans! Weâ€™re super excited about whatâ€™s in store for this year.
â€“ Matt Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewher eother than a hotel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
I use them all the time.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.
