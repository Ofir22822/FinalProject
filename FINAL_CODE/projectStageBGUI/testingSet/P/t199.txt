Itâ€™s easy to wander into high-end restaurants without realizing it and walk away with the idea that dining out in NYC is wallet-busting.
And while it is true that New York is home to a lot of $500 set-menu restaurants and restaurants where a niceâ€? simpleâ€? dinner with wine can top $100 the city is also home to starving artists working-class folks and underpaid interns trying to make it in the big city â€” and they canâ€™t afford any of those fancy meals.
Heck not many people can.
I mean who can drop $100 on dinner all the time? Not me! Not you! Not the majority of these people! Because of that New York City also has a variety of cheap eats happy hours and food deals that make it easy to eat in NYC on a budget.
However as a visitor itâ€™s often hard to know where to find those holes-in-the-wall and markets.
This is definitely a place where you need to be in the know for a lot of this deals.
There are thousands of restaurants in the city.
How do you navigate them all? You need someone on the inside.
That person is me! So today I am going to share my tips on how you can eat out in NYC on a budget and give you some of the knowledge Iâ€™ve accumulated by always eating out in the city Eating in NYC Tip #1 Hit the Oyster Happy Hours During the week you can find countless oyster happy hours which are one of the most popular things to do especially in the summer when you can sit outside.
They start around 4pm and go until 6 or 7pm and the oysters range from $1 to $1.50.
Arrive early as most restaurants fill up quickly and build up impossible wait times.
My favorite and the best oyster happy hours in NYC are Jeffreyâ€™s Grocery 172 Waverly Place West Village +1 646-398-7630 The Dead Rabbit 30 Water St +1 646-422-7906 Good Night Sonny 134 First Ave +1 646-692-3254 Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar 95 First Ave +1 646-791-5400 The Mermaid Inn 96 Second Ave East Village +1 212-674-5870 John Dory Oyster House 1196 Broadway +1 212-792-9000 Grand Central Oyster Bar lower level Grand Central Terminal 89 East 42nd St +1 212-490-6650 Zadieâ€™s Oyster Room 413 East 12th St Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar Chelsea Market 75 Ninth Ave +1 646-568-1223 The Ten Bells 247 Broome St +1 212-228-4450 <liSagaponack Bar & Grill 4 West 22nd St +1 212-229-2226 Greenpoint Fish &- Lobster Co.

This is a weekend-only thing and a staple of the cityâ€™s social scene.
There are countless bottomless brunches so it would be impossible to include them all here but below are some of the most affordable and best value bunches in the city The Flying Cock 497 Third Ave +1 212-689-6900 â€“ Pay $19 for bottomless Bloody Marys mimosas or Bellinis for 90 minutes.

Eating in NYC Tip #3 Grab a Pizza Slice NYC and pizza go together like white on rice.
You canâ€™t separate the two and in my opinion the New York slice is probably one of the best pizzas in the country sorry Chicago! If youâ€™re looking to eat on a budget grabbing a slice is one of the best ways to save money in New York.
Slices range from $1 to $4 though $2 is the max Iâ€™ll pay unless itâ€™s really good.
Below is a list of my favorite dollar-slice joints and a couple non-dollar slices just because they are that good Percyâ€™s Pizza 190 Bleecker St Joeâ€™s Pizza 150 East 14th St and other locations 2 Bros 601 Sixth Ave Ivanaâ€™s Pizzeria 2373 Arthur Ave Bronx +1 718-365-4322 99 Cents Fresh Pizza 151 East 43rd St 473 Lexington Ave 201 East 34th St B 9th Ave the Best Pizza 748 Ninth Ave NY Fresh Pizza 787 Ninth Ave Joey Pepperoniâ€™s Pizza 381 Broadway 493 Second Ave 114 East Fordham Rd Bronx One Dollar Pizza 578 Ninth Ave +1 212-967-3310 Vinny Vincenz Pizza 231 1st Ave 212-674-0707 Eating in NYC Tip #4 Munch on Dumplings Chinese dumplings are also one of the best value meals in the city because you can get huge plates of dumplings for literally just a few dollars and if you get them frozen for later they are even cheaper.
Theyâ€™ll fill you up for lunch and youâ€™ll still have leftovers for dinner.
And thanks to the cityâ€™s large Chinese immigrant population the dumplings are incredibly authentic.
This is the real deal here.

Eating in NYC Tip #5 Grab a Dog Hot dog shops litter the street corners of New York.
They might not be the healthiest meal but they are super cheap and make for a quick lunch.
Though the hot dog has been around for centuries the modern dog was popularized by Nathan Handwerker a Jewish immigrant from Poland living in NYC.
In 1915 he worked at a hot dog stand at Coney Island.
He started his own stand Nathanâ€™s Famous and undercut his former boss to sell his own dogs and the rest is hot dog history.
You can get a big juicy dog with lots of fixings for between $2 and $5.
Here are the best hot dog shops in New York City Grayâ€™s Papaya 2090 Broadway visit the website for more locations Crif Dogs 113 St Markâ€™s Pl +1 212-614-2728 Rudyâ€™s 627 9th Ave +1 646-707-0890 â€“ This dive bar gives you a free hot dog when you order a drink.
Nathanâ€™s Famous visit the website for locations Feltmanâ€™s Kitchen 80 St Markâ€™s Pl visit the website for other locations Dicksonâ€™s Farmstand Meats Chelsea Market +1 212-242-2630 Papaya King 179 East 86th St +1 212-369-0648 Tony Dragonâ€™s Grill Madison Ave & East 62nd St +1 917-299-1550 Paulâ€™s Da Burger Joint 131 2nd Ave +1 212-529-3033 Dominickâ€™s Hot Dog Truck Woodhaven Blvd & 67th Ave Deli & Dogz food truck visit the website for locations Harlem Shake 100 West 124th St Shake Shack visit the website for locations Eating in NYC Tip #6 Food Trucks If youâ€™re looking for cheap eats check out the food trucks around town that are a staple for the office workers.
Youâ€™ll find shawarma hot dogs gyros halal items and lots more grab-and-go food.
They tend to be located near big parks like Central Park or Union Square Midtown or the big squares in the financial district.
Their cheap quick eats are what we have for breakfast and lunch though many are around during the evening too.
Most meals costs $5-7 USD.
Eating in NYC Tip #7 Make Your Own Food Sure New York City has tons of delicious and expensive restaurants but go to the supermarket grab either a premade meal or ingredients to make your own and head to one of the parks and eat outside.
Or back to your Airbnb to make your meal.
Most supermarkets also have areas where you can eat inside too.
My favorite grocery stores in the city are Whole Foods â€“ Whole Foods has affordable natural and organic foods primarily from local vendors.
Trader Joeâ€™s â€“ A grocery store chain with super low prices all the time.
Food Emporium â€“ Another supermarket chain that also has lots of imported food options.
Eating in NYC Tip #8 Try Meal Pal for the extended traveler If youâ€™re looking to be in town for a while two weeks or more consider signing up for the service MealPal.
Itâ€™s $120 USD for a month $6 a meal which works out to be a super cheap way to eat.
Monday through Friday at lunch you get to choose a preset meal from thousands of restaurants.
Think of it like a lunch menu at your fingertips.
MealPal also has a dinner option and packages as small as 8 meals per month so even if youâ€™re planning a 2 week trip you could make this work any package you choose will make your lunches or dinners only $6-8 each.
Itâ€™s a good way to try new restaurants as well as eat cheap.
Eating in NYC Tip #9 Eat Outside Manhattan I love Manhattan.
Itâ€™s my favorite borough in the city but whenever I leave it Iâ€™m always reminded of how expensive it is.
The other boroughs are like half the price of Manhattan.
In Queens for example youâ€™ll find a ton of great and cheap ethnic food.
Eating in NYC Tip #10 Use the Apps Looking for cheap eats? Crowdsource.
Use apps to search for peopleâ€™s favorite restaurants or what is affordable near you.
My suggested apps are Yelp â€“ Yelp lets you find places to eat and drink in your area and there are usually tons of reviews left by patrons.
Foursquare â€“ Find out where the locals are eating and unlock special deals when you check into a place.
OpenTable â€“ Check local restaurant reviews and then reserve your table.
Roaming Hunger â€“ Find out which food trucks are in your area! Eating in NYC Tip #11 Eat Bagels The NYC bagel is as famous as the NYC slice.
We take our bagels seriously here Just ask all the ex-NYers living in LA if they can find a good bagel there! Theyâ€™ll say no and lament thatâ€™s one thing they miss the most.
Most bagels will cost $3-4 with cream cheese more if you want lox which you should.
A bagel sandwich will cost around $5-6.
Hereâ€™s a list of my favorite bagel spots Ess-a-Bagel 831 Third Ave +1 212-980-1010 Murrayâ€™s Bagels 500 Avenue of the Americas +1 212-462-2830 Lennyâ€™s Bagels 2601 Broadway +1 212-222-0410 Bagelsmith 189 Bedford Ave Brooklyn +1 718-218-7414 visit the website for more locations Russ & Daughters 127 Orchard St Lower East Side +1 212 475 4880 Baz Bagel 181 Grand St +1 212-335-0609 Absolute Bagel 2788 Broadway +1 212-932-2105 Best Bagel & Coffee 225 West 35th St A +1 212-564-4409 Kossarâ€™s 367 Grand St +1 212-473-4810 Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company 286 Eighth Ave +1 718-204-0141 Black Seed 170 Elizabeth St +1 212-730-1950 visit the website for more locations Tompkins Square Bagels 165 Avenue A +1 646-351-6520 Davidâ€™s Bagels 273 First Ave +1 212-780-2308 Zuckerâ€™s Bagels 370 Lexington Ave +1 212-608-5844 Bagel Supreme 9401 Fifth Ave +1 718-745-1108 Boâ€™s Bagels 235 West 116th St 917-902-8345 Danielâ€™s Bagels 569 Third Ave Eating in NYC Tip #12 Do Restaurant Week If youâ€™re here during July or October the exact dates change each year New York Cityâ€™s Restaurant Week has some amazing deals as over 380 of New Yorkâ€™s best restaurants offer $26 lunch menus and $42 three-course dinners.

Would like a way to opt out so that I can read the article easily.
Reply Keith November 8 2018 at 421 am My tip is to buy a sandwich at almost any deli bodega or corner store.
Theyâ€™re typically massive cost around $5 and when cut in half will give you 2 filling servings.
Much better than a chain store sandwich.
As a tourist in NYC grabbing one is the first order of business before heading out for a day of exploration.
Carrying one in your backpack will prevent the need for dining in an expensive lunch joint when you get hungry in the afternoon.
Reply Ali Raza February 11 2019 at 904 pm Matt that was really helpful post.
You have made it so simple to come to newyork.
thanks.
