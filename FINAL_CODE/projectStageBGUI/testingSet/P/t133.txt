There are more than 100 hostels in the city and its hostels are usually always at the top of all the best hostelsâ€? lists.
Year over year they always take home some of the top spots in the top-rated lists you see floating around the web.
As someone whoâ€™s been to Lisbon multiple times I can always see why.
Hostels in this city just get it.
They create a warm social atmosphere hire friendly and outgoing staff keep the places clean offer tons of free food and booze the key to any backpackerâ€™s heart and have super comfy beds.

Iâ€™ve been visiting Lisbon for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Lisbon are Location â€“ Lisbon is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In Lisbon you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Lisbon that I like the most.
