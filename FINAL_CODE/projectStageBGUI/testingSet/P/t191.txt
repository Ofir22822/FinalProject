Even though we were driven to the starting point and it was a trail it was very steep and caused a lot of heavy breathing on my part! To start off had a lovely breakfast in the hotel very nice elegant room.
Lots of yummy sweets sfogliatella is a traditional Napoli sweet and they had those delicious! mine had no filling but they come with all kinds.
Had one in Salerno and it wasnt very good so was hesitant to try it again but its big around here so decided to try it again was happy I did...
chocolate filled croissants etc...
lots of sugar! We met our tour guide at 945 not really a tour guide a guy drove us and 2 other people to Vesuvius we bought our ticket into the park and then he drove us up to the trailhead.
I was surprised by how steep it was not sure why as it is a mountain but I really dont have lots of experience with that sort of thing.
The trail was made up of what looked like very small gravel but reddish in color not sure exactly what its called Karen thinks its probably a combination of ash etc..
there was a big rain storm before we got there so it probably made it a bit more stable and not so dusty and moveable which was nice.
I took about 40 minutes to make it to the top as we kept stopping to take amazing view photos then when I saw the cauldera Wow very cool to look inside its very steep down into it and very deep no idea as to the depth.
Lots of school kids hiking it and yelling to get an echo its the same in every language! We met our driver back at the bottom at 1240 and he drove us to Herculaneum another WOW its on a much smaller scale than Pompei by far but so well preserved.
It was buried by mud 23 meters thick and it preserved wood and even some furniture.
We saw skeletons of people that tried to stay down by the water to escape but one of the explosions produced heat of about 500 centigrade and they died instantly.
We really had to hurry to meet our driver at the appointed time would have liked a bit more leisurely look through but it was good to be done also.
After 3 weeks of busyness my body is really tired and Im very happy Im not sick.
Will be doing some sleeping in hopefully when I get home! Right now its 630 and were waiting for the restaurant to open so we can go eat.
Only the tourist places are open before that! So starved though as I am we are waiting for the place the staff here recommended.
Will update yesterday when I can I wrote on it for a half an hour last night and then it crashed and nothing was saved! So since it was 1130 I gave up.
Right now its 724 and Im off to dinner will update later! Wendy Fit bit so far today 16545 which is 7.13 miles « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Wendy H.
