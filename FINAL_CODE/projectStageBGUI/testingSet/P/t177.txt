The list goes on.
There are so many amazing sites here that you could spend days heck even weeks just seeing the main most well-known ones.
But thereâ€™s more to Paris than the sites that attract thousands upon thousands of visitors each day.
While I was living Paris the past few months I made it my mission to see some of the more unusual lesser-known but equally awesome attractions that didnâ€™t come with the aggravating crowds that make so many of Parisâ€™ attractions unbearable.
And while some of the things on the list below might not be super secretâ€? attractions or activities they do fall into the category of overlooked attractionsâ€? so I included them.
Here are some of the best off-the-beaten-path things to see and do in Paris 1.
Le Manoir de Paris This is where macabre museum meets haunted house.
Numerous rooms highlight some of the more unsettling aspects of Parisâ€™s long and often dark past such as the Phantom of the Opera vampires or the crocodiles in the sewers.
Using real actors as well as animatronics the cityâ€™s gruesome and unsettling history is brought to life in an interesting way.
In addition to their museum they also have escape rooms as well as different levels of intensity depending on how scared you get! 18 Rue de Paradis +33 6 70 89 35 87 lemanoirdeparis.com.
Open Fridays 6pm-930pm and weekends 3pm-630pm.
Admission is 29 EUR for adults and 20 EUR for children 10-15.
2.
MusÃ©e Ã‰dith Piaf Ã‰dith Piaf is perhaps the most famous French singer from the 1930s to the 1960s and know around the world for her songs La vie en rose and Non je ne regrette rien which appeared in the movie Inception.
She lived in a little apartment in the MÃ©nilmontant district at the start of her career which has been turned into a tiny museum dedicated to her.
You get a glimpse at her life through her gold and platinum records photographs clothing letters from fans posters recordings and sheet music.
5 Rue Crespin du Gast +33 1 43 55 52 72.
Open Monday-Wednesday 1pm-6pm and Thursdays 10am-12pm.

Youâ€™ll also want to either speak decent French or go with someone who does.
3.
MusÃ©e Curie Marie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the only woman to win it twice for her research into radioactivity a word that she invented.
She was the first female professor at the University of Paris as well as the first woman to be entombed in the PanthÃ©on on her own merits.
Located in the 5th arrondissement this museum in her old laboratory highlights her radiological research.
Itâ€™s insightful and eye-opening for anyone unfamiliar with her historic discoveries.
1 Rue Pierre et Marie Curie +33 1 56 24 55 33 musee.curie.fr.
Open Wednesday-Saturday 1pm-5pm.
Admission is free.
4.
Archives Nationales Opened in 1867 the National Archives houses thousands of historical documents dating back to 625 CE.
One of six national archives in the country the museum sheds light on Franceâ€™s turbulent past providing nuanced historical details and context through permanent and temporary exhibitions.
Built by the order of Napoleon I the building itself known as the HÃ´tel de Soubise is absolutely stunning.
It is in the late Baroque style embracing long columns and lots of statues and sculptures.
It features immaculate grounds and gardens as well.
They always hold a lot of good exhibitions too.

5.
The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy Opened in 1898 this museum is home to over 1000 animal skeletons from around the world including complete skeletons of elephants large cats and even dinosaurs.
Itâ€™s as interesting as it is unsettling all the animals are facing the same way making it look like youâ€™re in the midst of some undead stampede! 2 Rue Buffon +33 1 40 79 56 01 www.mnhn.fr/en/visit/lieux/galerie-paleontologie-anatomie-comparee-paleontology-and-comparative-anatomy-gallery.

6.
The Vampire Museum Paris has a long history with the esoteric one that is brought to life in this fascinating if not macabre museum founded by an eccentric scholar to showcase his knowledge of the undead and esoteric.
Here youâ€™ll find vampire-killing kits rare texts on demonology and mysterious ancient relics.
Itâ€™s a busy eclectic creepy museum thatâ€™s a feast for the eyes and one worthy of a visit if youâ€™re at all interested in more obscure and fanciful tales.
Itâ€™s a fun kitschy museum.
14 Rue Jules David +33 1 43 62 80 76 artclips.free.fr/musee_des_vampires/MuseeVampires1.html.

7.
Petite Ceinture In use from 1862 through 1964 the railway circling Paris was abandoned when the city expanded beyond its limits.
Itâ€™s mostly hidden behind buildings and covered in wild plants and grass now though some sections are now officially open to the public.
Youâ€™ll find all sorts of flowers and street art along the tracks.
While some sections are illegal to visit near Parc Georges Brassens youâ€™ll find a section of the tracks known as the â€˜Passage de la Petite Ceintureâ€™ that is both free and legal to visit.
Itâ€™s located in the 15e arrondissement.
8.
The Salvador DalÃ­ Sundial This surrealist sundial was created by world-renowned artist Salvador DalÃ­.
Located on Rue Saint-Jacques itâ€™s is a mix of a human face and a scallop shell the symbol of the Camino to Santiago since the street is named after the saint.
While the sundial doesnâ€™t actually work itâ€™s nevertheless an easy way to see a piece of artwork by one of the most famous artists in the world.
27 Rue Saint-Jacques.
Open 24/7 with no admission.
9.
Montmartre Cemetery While the PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery is the largest and most popular in Paris for a more secluded stroll check out the Montmartre Cemetery.
Plenty of people visit the top of Montmartre for SacrÃ©-Coeur and the view but few take the time to wander this cemetery sitting at the foot of the district.
It opened in 1825 and is home to many cobwebbed mausoleums as well as a handful of stray cats.
You wonâ€™t see many people here so you can explore in peace.
20 Avenue Rachel +33 1 53 42 36 30 paris.fr/equipements/cimetiere-de-montmartre-5061.

The Museum of Counterfeiting Opened in 1972 this museum is home to counterfeit items that have been collected by Franceâ€™s customs agents and police as well as donated items from brands and consumers alike.
There are over 500 items in the museum ranging from counterfeit art and luxury goods to more mundane items like cleaning supplies.
While some knockoffs are impressive in their duplicity itâ€™s also funny to see just how bad some counterfeiters were! 16 Rue de la Faisanderie +33 1 56 26 14 03 musee-contrefacon.com.
Open Monday-Saturday 2pm-530pm.
Admission is 6 EUR per person for adults and 5 EUR for students and seniors.
11.
Promenade PlanteÃ© CoulÃ©e verte RenÃ©-Dumont This tree-lined walkway is a greenbelt that extends almost 5km along the old Vincennes railway line.
The railway line ceased functioning in 1969 with the park being inaugurated a few decades afterward.
Until New York built their High Line it was the only elevated park in the entire world.
And honestly this is way nicer then the NYC High Line.
Youâ€™ll find lots of trees flowers ponds and places to sit along this long path that stretches from Bastille to the edge of Paris.
Itâ€™s a long easy and beautiful walk.
You wonâ€™t find many people here.
Even on a nice day itâ€™s rather empty.
It quickly became one of my favorite things to do in Paris and I canâ€™t recommend coming here enough! 1 CoulÃ©e verte RenÃ©-Dumont 12th arrondissement.
Open daily from 8am-930pm.
Admission is free.
12.
Canal Saint-Martin Stretching 4.5km the Canal Saint-Martin is a man-made waterway commissioned by Napoleon.
Construction finished in 1825 connecting the Canal de lâ€™Ourcq to the Seine via both above ground locks and underground tunnels.
While not any secret spot on a nice day youâ€™ll find the canal lined with people itâ€™s mostly a spot for locals who want to have a picnic and relax.
So say no to the Seine and come have your outdoor picnic along the canal.
Itâ€™s more relaxing and there will be fewer people! The canal starts at Place de Stalingrad and ends at Quai de la RÃ¢pÃ©e.
Canal cruises last 2.5 hours and cost around 16 EUR per person.
13.
MuseÃ© de Montmartre Founded in 1960 this museum is located throughout two building that dates back to the 17th century.
Over the years the buildings were home to many famous writers and painters.
The gardens of the museum were actually renovated to look more like the gardens in Renoirâ€™s paintings there is also a vineyard nearby that dates back to the Middle Ages but it makes horrible wine.
The museumâ€™s permanent collection includes a wide variety of paintings posters and drawings.
