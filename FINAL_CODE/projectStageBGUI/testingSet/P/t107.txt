And you’ll hear fantastical tales from history and folklore from people who still believe that elves might exist.
It’s one of my favorite countries in the world one I fell in love with the first time I visited.
I’ve been back multiple times since then during various seasons.
But Iceland isn’t always easy to get around especially in the off-season when many bus routes shut down because of weather.
One of the ways to get around that problem is by joining an organized tour.
You’ll get to experience places that can be inaccessible without a four-wheel drive and you’ll have local knowledge to help make the most of your day depending on the ever-changing and often extreme weather.
I’ve put together a list of my favorite tour companies in Iceland from short city walking tours to multiday adventure hikes.
A lot of tour companies aren’t cheap there and you’ll definitely pay more than if you were to do the same route solo but here are the seven that provide incredible experiences at the right price 1.
Follow Me – Free Walking Tour Reykjavik A free walking tour is always a great way to introduce yourself to a new city and the guides from Follow Me can give you a good overview of Iceland’s capital on this 90-minute stroll.
It runs three city walking tours a day in peak season June to September and one a day the rest of the year it also now offers an Old Harbour and Brewery tour every afternoon.
The Reykjavik walking tours have been running since 2012 and the guides are all local comedians and entertainers who love the city and want to make you laugh while you’re exploring it.
They’ll show you some more overlooked parts of town and also give you some tips for saving money in this expensive country.
Like many free walking tours most guests tip the guide what they feel the tour was worth at the end.

Ride with Locals Ride with Locals is a motorcycle tour company that will take you to the middle of nowhere on trails you wouldn’t access any other way meaning you’ll see volcanoes craters and mountains that very few visitors to Iceland do making your Iceland experience particularly unique.
Its trips last between three days and a week and generally head inland rather than hugging the coast like most tours.
The motorcycles are KTM 690R and Husqvarna 701 dual sport bikes and all guides are really experienced with riding through Iceland’s highlands.
Some trips use sleeping bags in mountain huts for accommodations and include all the meals while others include hotel stays with breakfast.
Costs range between about $2800 and $5000 including motorbike hire and fuel depending on the length of the trip.

Intrepid Intrepid’s tour offerings are always solid using small groups and local guides and they don’t rush you from sight to sight.
It offers a number of options in Iceland including the classic Ring Road trip where you circumnavigate the island and get to visit some of the best-known sights from the glacier lagoon at Jökulsárlón on the south coast to the volcanic lake at Mývatn in the north.
There’s also a six-day camping trip along the southern coast.
Intrepid tours start at $1000 and go up to $4600 for the ten-day comfort tour.

Arctic Adventures/Trek Iceland/Extreme Iceland Arctic Adventures is a big player in the Iceland tour market these days and offers a huge range of one-day and multiday tours as well as helping you out with self-drive tour arrangements.
It’s owned by the same people who run Trek Iceland and Extreme Iceland two other tour companies that essentially run all the same tours as Arctic Adventures.
Its one-day tour options include all the main Icelandic sightseeing activities like ice caves snorkeling glacier tours and the popular Golden Circle route to Thingvellir National Park the Geysir hot springs and Gullfoss Waterfall.
They have mutli-day trips as well.
Arctic Adventures’ full-day trips range in price from around $100 to $160 depending on the need for equipment or smaller groups for the more adventurous activities.

Icelandic Mountains Guides For 25 years Icelandic Mountain Guides has focused on true adventure travel with very small groups.
Its multiday tours include more unique routes like a five-day backpacking trek from Núpsstaðaskógur to Skaftafell or a ten-day expedition across the Highlands starting from the northern town of Akureyri these longer trips will set you back upwards of $4000.
It also runs one-day tours to ice caves and glacier walk experiences among others leaving from Reykjavík along with similar one-day adventures on the Sólheimajökull glacier on the south coast if you’re in the area and can meet them there.
The half-day and one-day tours are generally pricier than other companies from $100 and up for half-day excursions but often include specialist equipment or ride on quad bikes or snowmobiles.
Icelandic Mountain Guides has a genuine conservation focus and holds a twice-yearly event where guides spend time planting trees.
Its current aim is to increase its carbon-offset programs so that its multiday tours are also carbon neutral.

Iceland Horizon Iceland Horizon offers a huge ariety of single-day tours all around the country.
They’re a good choice for travelers who want to see the main sights and do fun activities but who don’t have access to their own vehicle.
They run their small-group tours always under 19 people from a mini-bus which has Wi-Fi making it a comfortable way to see the sights without having to bother with renting your own car.
They also run multi-day trips ranging from 3-7 days that cover all the best highlights of the country including Northern Lights tours and tours around the Snaefellsness peninsula.
