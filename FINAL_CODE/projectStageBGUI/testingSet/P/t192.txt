OK I am a very healthy guy when I am home in my apartment with my juicer kitchen and nearby Whole Foods.
On the road itâ€™s another story.
Even with the high expectations and goals I set for myself a few years ago Iâ€™ve failed at maintaining a healthier lifestyle on the road.
While I make more health-conscious decisions I still go out too much never sleep and stuff my face with pizza because it is convenient.
To try to change that I met up with my friend Steve Kamb the legend behind Nerd Fitness a site dedicated to helping nerds stay fit.
Steve travels a lot too and he knows how to balance life on the road with staying in shape.
We sat down together to talk about all things fitness and travel.
Here are Steveâ€™s top tips for staying healthy and in shape while traveling.
My Interview with Steve For more travel and fitness advice hereâ€™s an interview with Steve I did a few years ago.
Itâ€™s full of helpful tips and advice and expands on many of the points above.
If you really want to learn how to stay in shape both at home and abroad watch this video! 7 Tips for Staying In Shape While Traveling 1.
Make Healthy Living on the Road a Priority! Yes you DO have time to exercise you just need to make time for it.
You can complete a workout in 20 minutes in your hotel room or hostel using basic exercises â€” and you donâ€™t need any equipment! Here are some simple and effective exercises you can do in your hotel hostel or even just a nearby park Jumping jacks Push-ups Sit-ups Burpees Lunges Squats Stretching/yoga Even just 5 minutes of these exercises will have you sweating.
And you can literally do these exercises anywhere too.
Where thereâ€™s a will thereâ€™s a way! 2.
Walking for the Win! Do everything you can to walk as often as possible.
Thereâ€™s no better way to explore a city than on foot.
You get to take in a lot more of the local life and itâ€™s much easier to get away from the crowds this way.
Plus itâ€™s cheaper than taking a taxi or paying for a bus ticket.
If just exploring at random isnâ€™t exciting sign up for a walking tour.
Most cities will offer free walking tours that usually last between 1-3 hours.
Not only will you get an insightful introduction to your location but youâ€™ll get in a lot of steps too! 3.
Playgrounds and Parks Check Google Maps for a nearby park and walk over there for your workouts.
Many parks have equipment you can use to work out with though if they donâ€™t you can do pull-ups on swing sets or tree branches.
Get creative! Also check websites like meetup.com for regular workout groups.
Most cities have running clubs that host weekly runs yoga sessions in the park tai chi and other sports/activities.
Check around to see if there is anything nearby that piques your interest and will help you stay active.
Donâ€™t be afraid to try new things either! Plogging jogging and picking up trash slacklining tumbling parkour â€” there are tons of unique options to be found if you spend a little time looking.
4.
Diet is 80% of the Battle As a budget traveler chances are youâ€™re working hard to lower your food budget.
That likely means that youâ€™re not eating well.
Consider upping your food budget even slightly so you can eat healthier.
Get some protein and veggies in your diet! Donâ€™t be afraid to do a healthy family dinnerâ€? with hostel mates where you all split the cost.
You can also try changing up your diet to better suit the local options.
That way youâ€™ll be eating more fresh produce while supporting the local economy.
You can also make more drastic changes to your diet as well.
Itâ€™s never been easier to travel with a plant-based diet and still stay healthy and energetic.
That doesnâ€™t mean you need to cut out all the junk or cheap drinks.
But your diet is the most important component when it comes to health and fitness.
Invest in it! 5.
Do the Best You Can If you only have 10 minutes to exercise exercise for 10 minutes! Every little bit adds up and 10 minutes is better than nothing.
If you have to eat poorly at the train station make up for it the next day.
At the end of the day itâ€™s all about progress.
Not perfection.
Do your best.
Lay the groundwork for better habits.
Nothing happens overnight but every step in the right direction will help you reach your goal.
6.
Employ the Never 2â€? Rule If you miss a day of exercise for whatever reason donâ€™t allow yourself to miss two days in a row.
If you eat one bad meal that next meal should be healthy.
Never two in a row.
By employing the Never 2â€? rule youâ€™ll be able to prevent bad habits from taking hold.
The odd day off or cheat meal? No problem.
But when it comes to staying in shape consistency is key.
Try to keep your momentum going.
Youâ€™ll see results much quicker that way which will encourage you to stay on track.
7.
Have Fun! Donâ€™t be afraid to have late nights with friends or say yes to crazy adventures.
After all thatâ€™s why we travel! Just make sure you get right back on track as soon as possible afterward so you donâ€™t lose the momentum youâ€™ve built up.
While it might seem challenging to balance fun and fitness it just takes a little practice and effort.
Once you get the habit in place youâ€™ll wonder why you didnâ€™t start sooner! **** For more fitness tips and information check out Nerd Fitness.

But on the the road I donâ€™t have as much time.
So we just walk everywhere.
We walk.
A lot.
I think our most we did was 15 miles in a day.
Average 6 miles a day.
I feel fit when we have a good walking route for the day ð?™‚ Reply Helen August 7 2013 at 756 pm Great tips! I agree with Nicole too lots of walking! I like to get involved in dance classes too you can always find dance classes whilst travelling and theyâ€™re a good way to get into the local culture too.
Or cycling round a city is one of my favourite ways to see a new or familiar place! Reply Wil August 8 2013 at 643 am After I wake up and just before bed I do a few minutes of yoga followed by pushups and Iâ€™ve noticed a serious improvement in my health.
Reply Shaun August 8 2013 at 955 am Great tips.
Steve has an excellent website as well.
There are many exercises available to travelers.
Walking hits two birds with one stone get where youâ€™re going and burn a few calories! Reply Scott August 8 2013 at 929 pm I love to run when Iâ€™m home so next time Iâ€™m on the road I think Iâ€™m going to bring my GPS watch and shoes along with me.
Running is a great way to see a city! Reply Kilee August 8 2013 at 935 pm Great tips! Indonesia has been doing a number on meâ€¦ the food is so delicious and Iâ€™m finding most grab-and-go snacks at the corner shops lack anything healthy or without sugar even the crackers have sugar on top of them!!.
Regular trekking/hiking is my choice when it comes to exercising on the road ð?™‚ Though there is a gym in the hotel weâ€™re staying at nowâ€¦ might be feeling inspired ð?˜‰ Reply Beto August 8 2013 at 951 pm I can attest how even your best of disciplines get challenged on the road.
When Iâ€™m not traveling I include a lot of fruits and salad on my diet so while going places I try to find a reasonable substitute.
If I have access to a fridge I can get prepacked salads from supermarkets and fruits from a corner stall to get by for several days and to carry as snack in my day pack so I donâ€™t end up settling for less healthy stuff or at least be less tempted.
As for exercise Iâ€™ve always liked walking and oftentimes end up walking more than I could care to admit.
Reply Jean August 9 2013 at 603 am Believe it or not Iâ€™m actually healthier when Im travelling as I engage in outdoor activities that I otherwise wouldnâ€™t be doing while at home.
I detest the gym and the only â€˜workoutâ€™ i do when at home is opening the fridgeâ€“ i built bicpes on that! On my last two trips I have been snorkelling freediving diving while eating probably Twice the amount of what I normally eat and still I lost abit of weight.
So the solution is â€“ keep travelling! LOL.
I wish! Itâ€™s always much more fun to workoutâ€? without really working out like walking/exploring a new city/ hiking/ swimming Reply Jan August 9 2013 at 620 am Same here ð?™‚ The best work out is walking/exploring a new city! Reply Matej August 9 2013 at 846 am What about traditional cuisine? Food is a big part of travel for a lot of people including me and I want to eat as much traditional food as possible while in that country.
Most include some type of carbs no matter the cuisine.
For example asking for more vegetables instead of rice basically changes original taste.
By the way in better hotels you can pay for one day gym pass.
I used that often.
Reply Kristin Addis August 9 2013 at 457 pm I went from certified Pilates instructor working out all the time to certified food tester and fried goodness eater in Southeast Asia.
My issue is working out in that horrible humidity and heat.
Not every hostel has AC.
Would be interested on his thoughts on that.
Reply Andrew August 10 2013 at 844 pm Pushups will do wonders even if you donâ€™t have much time.
Most days all i do is a set of pushups when i wake up and a set of pushups before i go to bed and i keep alot of muscle tone.
I usually do 20 reps each set but do as many as your comfortable with.
Reply Jack August 11 2013 at 646 pm I almost always more active while traveling but sometimes when traveling with those who like to hang out at the pool bar things can be a little tough so I always find time to walk.
Taking an apple to replace the salty peanuts while flying is a great way to add moisture and can be pretty filling.
Reply Arianwen August 12 2013 at 433 am There are some great tips here thanks! When I was training for a marathon a couple of years ago I was visiting Madrid and decided to take my camera and a printed map and run around the city.
It worked really well.
I definitely saw more than I would have otherwise.
The only downside was not feeling like it would be appropriate to enter museums or places of worship in my lycra! Reply Olov Lindgren August 14 2013 at 334 am Becoming vegan has been a huge health improvement on and off the road.
I strive to eat vegan when travelling but in countries where vegan food is scarce I resort to vegetarian food.
This diet combined with a lot of walking is a great way to stay healthy.
Sure I indulge in junk food and snacks on occasion but eating primarily healthy means the damage of that kind of food is greatly reduced.
Another tip is to bring your running shoes with you when you travel.
If your tight on space bring a pair of Vibrams or go barefoot Reply Sharalyn August 15 2013 at 359 am Thank you ever so much for this great video Matt! I am middle-aged and find the exercise thing a real challenge while on the road.
The tips in this video were great and I really appreciate that Steve has a great balance with his life and understanding of what it is like on the road.
When I travel I choose to walk everywhere.
I wear an up braceletâ€? that tracks my steps and I average about 6 miles a day.
Plus I have a power yoga DVD that I bring along and try to do that 3-4 times a week.
I travel with my yoga mattâ€¦when I use a backpack I just strap it onto the side or I pack it in my suitcase.
However I am going to check out Steveâ€™s 20 minute hotel routine for days when I feel a crunch for timeâ€¦.although I donâ€™t see myself ever doing a pull-up ð?™‚ Great postâ€¦thank you thank you thank you! Reply Martin August 15 2013 at 1202 pm Hi Matt you become more conscious of what you eat as you get older and taking regular exerciser.
I find when travelling staying at most hostels this can go out the window when meeting people so this time I took a converted campervan around Spain staying away from tourist areas I found it easy to meet like mined people who liked walking and cycling and as you know the food is local and traditional.
I lost over a stone and felt great! Reply Roberto August 15 2013 at 612 pm I think that in order to eat healthy and do exercise first it has to be a decision you make for yourself either you are at home or traveling.
When you make that decision then when traveling you need imagination and determination whichever comes first.
Everywhere you will find fruits vegetables water nuts tuna sardines canned its ok or local traditional food.
Even in a gas station store you will find bananas butâ€¦have you the determination? Reply SkÃºli August 18 2013 at 1038 am Some great advice here I like the never two rule it gives you a chance to fuck up but jump right back on that horse again.
That is often a problem with keeping a routine people thinking that if they screw up once the routine is ruined and they might as well binge on a liter of icecream after the burger and pizza.
But thatâ€™s not the case.
Just keep at it! Reply Burcu September 2 2013 at 654 am I especially like the walking part.
If one walks to every walkable destination during a trip â€“ that fact alone will take care of all remaining fir requirements.
It is also a lot more fun to walk in a destination that you are not familiar with than walking in your own city.
Reply Christine December 29 2013 at 457 pm Great tips.
Its hard to find time to exercise while traveling but we do end up walking EVERYWHERE.
Thereâ€™s no better exercise than walking miles with a big backpack on! We end up carb-loading as well as having a big pasta dinner is often the easiest and cheapest.
Good list.
Reply Leia Chester April 9 2015 at 122 pm due to busy work I do not have time to fully implement a complete exercise but I usually spend 30-45 â€˜to jog in the gym.
That is quite favorable for the current situation but to recognize that outdoor exercise is always to best effect ð?™‚ Reply Samantha September 28 2015 at 223 pm Great tips Matt.
My husband and I are heading to NYC next month and we will be doing a lot of walking.
That should help with the extra we will eat while be on the road.
The hotel also has a gym and pool which is great.
I did like the 2 rule.
Good for home or travel ð?™‚ Have a good one.
Reply Lisa October 2 2015 at 1032 am Hey Matt Currently in Thailand and loving the food.
I wonder how healthy fried rice is all the time though! A bit of Muay Thai should counteract the belly but god damn the fried food is good out here! Reply Catherine December 19 2015 at 604 am Thank you for your post! Itâ€™s very interesting and helpful! Especially the tips they are so great and not only useful but neccessary I think.
But they also take time to get used to and process.
But I think we totally can right? Thanks again.
Looking for your next posts.
Reply Leslie Carbone January 8 2020 at 209 pm I do crunches and burpees in my hotel room while the coffeeâ€™s brewing that way I always start the day with exercise.
I also walk as much as possible when I travel.
Reply Wes Pearce January 8 2020 at 224 pm I think one of the hardest things to do is keep to a regular fitness program and healthy eating while traveling.
One thing I try to do is filter my Airbnbs to have a gym in the building.
This definitely limits my options but it helps me stay on track with fitness.
Or I try to search for local gyms ahead of time so that I know where they are and can save time.
