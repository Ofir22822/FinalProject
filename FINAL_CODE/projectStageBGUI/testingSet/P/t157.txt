Itâ€™s the capital of Japan and home to a wide array of fun historic and quirky attractions.
From the worldâ€™s largest tuna auction and the Imperial Palace to robot restaurants and vampire cafÃ©s Tokyo really does have something for everyone.
Whether youâ€™re here for a short stopover or living here as an expat youâ€™ll be able to find plenty of ways to pass the time and get a feel for the organized chaos that is Tokyo.
To help you make the most out of your trip here are the best things to see and do in Tokyo 1.
Visit the Fish Market The Tsukiji Fish Market was one of the most iconic staples of the city.
In 2018 the market moved to Toyosu and is now twice the size of the original Tsukiji market.
In fact the new market is the largest fish market in the entire world.
While youâ€™ll need a visitorâ€™s pass to enter you can get one on arrival the pass is free which means youâ€™ll have more money to spend on sushi! There are over 600 vendors here selling fresh fish as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.
Gorge on sushi and marvel at the chaotic atmosphere of the worldâ€™s largest tuna market.
The tuna auction here powers much of the worldâ€™s sushi supply and it is truly a sight to be seen.
You can also see a model of the largest tuna ever sold at Tsujiki â€” which weighed 500kg 1100lbs!.
In addition to the new market the old outer market at Tsukiji still has plenty of restaurants and shops.
You can still head there to eat and look around though all the action is now at Toyosu.

Explore by the Imperial Palace The Imperial Palace is the official home of the Emperor of Japan.
Itâ€™s a terrific spot to learn about Japanâ€™s history and culture.
Formerly Edo Castle the palace was built in the 15th century and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day.
When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace.

The palace is surrounded by beautiful grounds and a park and thereâ€™s a moat around the massive stone walls.

Tea was brought to Japan in the 9th century by a Buddhist monk and by the 12th century the ceremony began to take shape.
While these ceremonies are usually long not to mention expensive there are plenty of budget-friendly options for anyone looking to experience one without breaking the bank.

There are also a few important things to see in the park as well.

While youâ€™re here make sure to visit the statue between Shibuya Station and the intersection.

Their ticketing policy is odd and you might want to update the article â€” tickets are sold online starting on the 10th of the month for the following monthâ€™s tickets e.g.
Dec 10 for tickets in January.
If you donâ€™t pre-book youâ€™re out of luck.
