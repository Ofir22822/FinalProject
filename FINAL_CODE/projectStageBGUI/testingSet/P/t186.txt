While most used be located in Santa Monica or West Hollywood you’ll find hostels spread out all over the city now.
That’s great because LA itself is super spread out and it’s a pain in the butt to get anywhere.
Now if you want to stay in a hostel you’re no longer confined to just a few parts of town.
The city is your oyster! I’ve been visiting LA for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Los Angeles are Location – LA is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price – In LA you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Los Angeles that I like the most.
