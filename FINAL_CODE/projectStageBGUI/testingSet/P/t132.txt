Posted Azerbaijan is one of those emerging destinations that tourists are finally starting to discover.
Until 1991 it was part of the Soviet Union and ever since it became independent travelers have increasingly started to visit this lesser-known country.
The number of foreign visitors has nearly tripled in the last decade to almost three million in 2018.
While the sightseeing hot spots might not be well known there are plenty of things to see and do in Azerbaijan.
The capital Baku has unique architecture including lots of Parisian-style buildings from the 19th century.
It is also home to some very futuristic constructions funded by the countryâ€™s oil wealth such as the three Flame Towers which are covered in LED screens that display dancing flames.
Outside of Baku you can see mud volcanoes visit 40000-year-old rock paintings at Gobustan or head to the hills to hike in the Caucasus Mountains.
But is Azerbaijan safe? On the whole Azerbaijan is very safe.
Since the country is ruled by a strongman who wants very much to increase tourism to the country crimes against visitors are virtually unheard of.
Why? Because if someone is caught committing a crime against a tourist the punishments will be quite severe.
Most crimes are usually small and involve taking advantage of people in crowded places where perpetrators are less likely to get caught.
With that said there are a few things to remember and a couple of locations to avoid.
The tips below will help make your experience in Azerbaijan safe and enjoyable.
8 Safety Tips for Azerbaijan 1.
Stay aware of your belongings â€“ Petty theft and pickpocketing are rare here as the government which is a dictatorship punishes thieves quite harshly.
Nevertheless petty theft does happen from time to time in busy outdoor markets in Azerbaijan as well as on the Baku metro and other public transport.
Be more aware of your belongings when youâ€™re in crowded places and donâ€™t flaunt anything expensive.
2.
Look out for drink-related scams â€“ There have been some reports of travelers being robbed after having their drinks spiked particularly in Western-style nightclubs and bars in Baku.
Donâ€™t take food or drink from strangers or people youâ€™ve just met and always keep an eye on drinks youâ€™ve ordered.
There are also reports of scams targeting men at bars when women ask a foreign man to buy her drinks.
She ends up leaving him with a very high bar tab and if heâ€™s unable to pay a group of men might use physical force to insist.
3.
Donâ€™t insult the ruling Aliyev family â€“ The president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev who took over from his father Heydar in 2003 and his family are not to be mocked or spoken about badly.
He has won five elections with around 80% of the vote but thereâ€™s plenty of evidence that he and his New Azerbaijan Party are responsible for widespread corruption and a lack of democratic process along with jailing people who have criticized the family or the government.
Play it safe and avoid talking politics while youâ€™re here.
4.
Donâ€™t go near or talk about Armenia â€“ Avoid the border of Armenia and Azerbaijan where sporadic armed clashes still take place.
In particular donâ€™t go near the Nagorno-Karabakh region which is a disputed area where armed conflict is common.
There are land mines in these regions as well another good reason to steer clear.
The safest thing is simply not to mention Armenia at all.
Thereâ€™s an ongoing bitter conflict between the two nations and Azerbaijanis can get angry if you try to talk about Armenia.
If youâ€™re of Armenian descent â€” for example if you have an Armenian surname â€” this might cause problems for you in Azerbaijan so be prepared.
5.
Be careful on the roads â€“ Many of the roads in Azerbaijan are in poor condition and drivers often speed.
You also need to watch out for people on foot and livestock in rural Azerbaijan.
If you can avoid it donâ€™t drive at night â€” there is usually little or no lighting on the roads and there are a lot of potholes and bumps that can cause a bad accident if you canâ€™t see them coming.
On the plus side the blood alcohol limit here is zero so there is no tolerance for drinking and driving which means youâ€™re less likely to encounter drunk drivers here.
If driving make sure you follow this law to the letter.
Road safety is likely going to be your biggest concern here so always be extra careful when driving or near busy roads.
6.
Refuse to pay bribes â€“ Thereâ€™s quite a culture of bribery and corruption in Azerbaijan so you might find yourself in a situation where youâ€™re asked to pay a bribe.
Although it can feel difficult itâ€™s OK to refuse to pay and usually that will be the end of it.
Many Azerbaijanis are embarrassed by the extent of corruption and bribery and will do their best to hide it from foreign tourists.
Unfortunately there is a minority who will still demand bribes â€” sometimes even officials.
7.
Look out for fake police â€“ Itâ€™s quite a common scam to come across criminals dressed as police officers.
In their disguise they will target foreigners and try to issue you a fake traffic infringement or demand you pay a fine for photographing in the street.
If in doubt ask them to take you to a police station.
Hopefully they will then agree to leave you alone.
8.
Buy travel insurance â€“ Every time you travel you should make sure you have an appropriate level of travel insurance.
You never know what might go wrong! Hopefully nothing will happen to you while youâ€™re exploring Azerbaijan but youâ€™ll be really grateful you have travel insurance if you are involved in a car accident become the victim of theft or get sick and find yourself in an emergency situation.
We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70.

The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance FAQ on Azerbaijan Safety To help you plan your trip here are answers to the most frequently asked questions we get about safety in Azerbaijan How safe is Baku for tourists? Thanks to income from oil and gas Baku is a modern capital city with decent public transport and is generally safe.
There are some risks of petty theft in crowds or bars and tourists can be a target of drink spiking and other scams see above in Western-style bars and nightclubs.
Be extra vigilant on a night out.
Maybe the most dangerous part of being in Baku is the traffic.
Many Azerbaijanis drive very fast and without much regard for the rules of the road.
If youâ€™re a pedestrian be wary of vehicles when youâ€™re near a road and especially when youâ€™re crossing.
When in doubt follow the lead of the locals.
Is it safe to drive in Azerbaijan? Driving in Baku can be challenging quite a lot of traffic fast drivers and pedestrians who donâ€™t pay much attention.
However itâ€™s probably more dangerous to drive in rural areas both because of the poor driving standards and the low quality of the highways.
The road conditions are particularly bad outside the cities and driving at night is especially dangerous as the roads are poorly lit or not lit at all.
Is Azerbaijan safe for women traveling alone? In general Azerbaijan is safe for all people traveling solo but some women have reported incidents of unwanted male attention while walking alone and taking taxis.
If going out at night make sure you have someone to accompany you just to be safe.
Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel Women Shouldnâ€™t Be Afraid to Travel Alone Is the drinking water safe in Azerbaijan? The tap water in Azerbaijan should be boiled before drinking to make sure that it is free of contaminants.
Boil the water for at least 1 minute to make sure itâ€™s clean.
While you can also buy bottled water here Iâ€™d just bringing a reusable water bottle and a Lifestraw or SteriPen.
They can purify your water while also reducing your environmental impact.
*** From the contrasts of 19th-century architecture with the envelope-pushing modern buildings of Baku to the scenic vistas of the sparsely-populated towns and villages youâ€™ll find plenty of things to see and do in Azerbaijan.
Just be sure to use common sense by avoiding talking about sensitive topics such as the war with Armenia when you are talking to locals.
Be aware of the potential for petty theft and scams keep an eye out and your valuables out of sight.
Do that and youâ€™ll be just fine.
On the whole Azerbaijan is safe to visit and tourism numbers are growing for a good reason.

Really cool? Reply Renuka Walter October 24 2019 at 830 am No mention of Armenia! Sounds quite scaryâ€¦! Would love to visit Azerbaijan.
Sounds like an interesting destination.
Reply Nihad S March 3 2020 at 339 am I totally disagree with the 7.th.
I live in Azerbaijan for 23 years and I never heard anything like that or even similar to that.
Wearing like a policeman is crime and nobody would like to risk it.
Nothing happened like that before.
Also about the roads.
Most of the roads in the central areas are new and flat.
Of course there are some roads that are a little bit old but mostly they are either out of the city or inside the neighborhood.
About safety I can say that Azerbaijan is so safe country to travel.
Iâ€™ve traveled almost all of the european countries and I can say that they are more dangerous than Azerbaijan.
Also wherever you go Azerbaijani people will welcome you really warm and try to do their best in order to host you in their country ð?™‚ Reply Leave a Comment Cancel reply By posting a comment you agree to our community friendly anti-spam comment policy that can be found here.
