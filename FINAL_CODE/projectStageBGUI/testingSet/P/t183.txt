They came back glowing from life-changing experiences telling stories of new friends spontaneous trips to exotic locations foreign beauties weirdâ€? food and life lessons learned.
Their tales made it sound like they lived through a coming of age movie.
I thought of doing it myself.
How exciting it must be! To be in a foreign country learning a new language reinventing yourself meeting foreign girls and being able to legally drink.
For a college student it sounded like magic.
But though I took the forms to fill out each semester I never studied abroad.
Semester after semester passed and I let the opportunities slip by.
Why? For a simple reason FEAR.
I was always too afraid.
I wasnâ€™t afraid of what would happen or if I would succeed.
No I had a worse kind of fear FOMO.
The fear of missing out.
I worried constantly that life back home would pass me by and Iâ€™d be forgotten.
What changes would happen with my friends? What parties would I miss? What gossip? What if there was some big event at school and I wasnâ€™t there? What inside jokes would I not be a part of? What if the President came? What if this! What if that! As a shy unconfident college kid I never wanted to leave because I was incorrectly afraid that if I left Iâ€™d come back and life would have moved on without me and Iâ€™d be a stranger to those around me.
I didnâ€™t want to hear stories from my friends about things they did while I was away â€” I wanted to be a part of those experiences.
In my mind I knew I would have created my own stories abroad but I was too afraid about what stories I would miss if I left.
So I stayed at home.
And though I did eventually go traveling I regret not studying abroad.
You canâ€™t change the past.
And maybe if I had studied abroad I never would have gone traveling later or made this website.
You canâ€™t be mired in what-ifs.
You can only make the best decisions you can at the time with the information you have.
But I regret the decision because I let fear win.
I let fear rule my life.
I went with the devil I knew because it was easier.
I allowed me to stay in my comfort zone and never really test myself.
I could always have the dream of what might have beenâ€? without actually having to do it.
I put off a great experience because I was afraid of what the future might have happened.
You canâ€™t let the fear win.
Fear is the enemy of your dreams.
It was a hard lesson to learn but missing out on studying abroad showed me that you canâ€™t let your fear hold you back.
In previous posts Iâ€™ve written about how now is a good time to travel because of the economy and about how the only secret to long term traveling is desire.
But even those with the greatest desire to travel can still be held back by fear.
The Dutch have a saying He who is outside his door already has the hardest part of his journey behind him.â€? If you talk to any traveler they will all tell you the same thing nothing changes back home.
People might get a new job or a new girlfriend.
Maybe they will move.
Someone might get married.
A restaurant might close.
A bar might no longer be cool.
But the day to day life will be the same and when you know that youâ€™ll thank yourself for not giving into fear.
Life never gives you the same chance twice.
Doors donâ€™t reopen.
Once they shut they shut for good.
Itâ€™s easier to travel than you think.
Once you take that first step out the door anything is possible.
Whether itâ€™s a two week trip to Bali a year-long trip around the world or finally taking the family to Disney get going now because you are missing a big world out there.
I regret never leaving to study abroad.
I canâ€™t take back my decision but I can make sure I am never afraid to step out the door again.
Because in the end what will you regret not going more than youâ€™ll regret going.

facebook twitter pinterest email Related Posts How to Overcome Your Travel Fears My Biggest Travel Regret Why Travel Makes You Awesome There are 47 Comments Dan June 17 2009 at 948 pm All very true.
Although its not travelling as such Iâ€™ve recently moved back to Scotland after living in London for a couple of years and have noticed that absolutely nothing has changed.
Same people same places just a different day.
Reply Sean June 17 2009 at 957 pm Matt All very true points.
In a couple of my recent blog posts I have talked about how passing on great opportunities can lead to regret later on down the line.
With that being said if you had traveled abroad maybe that would have set you on a different path and you wouldnâ€™t be where you are today? In some ways I imagine that it was a good decision not to study abroad because it sounds like you are living quite the life at the moment.
Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1220 am Well hindsight is 20/20 and the path I am on now is because I didnâ€™t go away.
That being said I still wish it was something I experienced but I do enjoy my life now Reply Tanya June 18 2009 at 1246 am I wish everyone could learn the nothing changes back homeâ€? lesson.
So true.
I cringe when people tell me theyâ€™re not going abroad because they donâ€™t want to miss out on something back home.
Thatâ€™s just crazy talk.
Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1227 am Reading the comments here itâ€™s amazing how many people also felt that when they came back nothing has changed.
Reply Dave June 18 2009 at 112 am Yep I can relate all to well.
In college I told myself Iâ€™d miss school and my friends too much if I went away.
None of my closest friends or I went away but after I graduated a few friends studied abroad in India and Russia and I even bumped into an art classmate while she was doing a semester abroad in Venice Italy.
I was beyond envious.
But if I didnâ€™t not travel internationally in my early and mid 20â€™s I donâ€™t think I wouldâ€™ve been so motivated to save for a 20-month trip around the world which is about to conclude next month! Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1229 am dave good to see you here ð?™‚ Reply Brandy June 18 2009 at 128 am I can totally relate to this post.
Back then Iâ€™d never been out of the country and was worried and scared that Iâ€™d miss out on something back home and/or be so homesick Iâ€™d have to come back early tail between my legs.
Fortunately I did end up taking a little leap and studying abroad for a month in Madrid between my junior and senior year of college but my big regret is that I wish I wouldâ€™ve known how much I would love it.
If I had I wouldâ€™ve studied abroad in a couple of different places.
Then again I also wish I knew how much I loved traveling prior to college.
if I had I wouldâ€™ve majored in something more conducive to a lifestyle of frequent travel.
And yet even after reading what you wrote the comments and my own experience with travel regretâ€? here I am with those exact same regrets.
Itâ€™s been four years since I graduate college and Iâ€™ve been seriously thinking about taking off now for like two years.
Have I made saving money to take a trip a priority though? No I havenâ€™t and I kinda hate myself for it.
Hereâ€™s to hoping I can have enough fiscal discipline to finally take the plunge at the end of this year.
Wow that got a little long sorry.
This whole concept of travel regretsâ€? really just hit home because Iâ€™ve been thinking about it non-stop lately and it was on my mind today especially.
Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1230 am good! now get saving and get going ð?™‚ Your next comment better be from some far off country! Reply Todd June 17 2009 at 1006 pm Well said â€“ I feel exactly the same way about not studying abroad during the college years.
Fortunately I got a chance at a do-overâ€? two years after graduation when I was sent to live on my own with no Spanish skills in Madrid for a few months of work â€“ a life experience that was tremendously influential more on account of the personal lessons learned than of the work experience.
I never hesitate to share my opinion that every college student should seriously consider study abroad â€“ hereâ€™s to hoping your post convinces a few more to do so! Reply Sean June 17 2009 at 1009 pm I should also add to my comment that I too did not study abroad in college and completely have regrets about it.
Todd thats awesome you were able to get a similar experience through your work! Reply Tim June 18 2009 at 234 am Matt Thanks for your post on this.
With the way the economy is now is the perfect time to travel and have no regrets.
If you do have regrets now is the perfect time to fix those regrets.
I agree with the other comments who say that travel finds you when you are ready for it.
In highschool I traveled to Moscow Russia for 3 weeks and didnt fully appreciate the experience till many years later.
Now that I am working and can only travel 4 weeks out of the year I definitely appreciate my experiences more.
I am working towards being able to leave the corporate life behindâ€¦getting closer every day and month that passes.
Thanks for this post.
Reply Laura June 18 2009 at 247 am Nothing changed! Babies were had marriages happened! For me my little sister is growing up without me â€“ I canâ€™t take her to see colleges or help with homework.
I donâ€™t regret I just wish they would freeze time while Iâ€™m gone â€“ but that doesnâ€™t happen.
Also if I had done a year abroad I wouldnâ€™t have started dating my husband! Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1231 am nothing has essentially changed laura.
im home and everyone is still doing the same thing.
Reply Graham June 18 2009 at 252 am I never spent a semester abroad when I was in school and it has always been a big regret.
I could have experienced so much more of the world earlier in my life.
Now that I am living abroad Iâ€™m so happy that I made the decision and I was able to overcome my fears.
Fear really is the big thing that holds most of us back.
And really it is like nothing changes back home.
I talk to my friends and itâ€™s always the same.
Theyâ€™re not changing or growing or moving on with their lives.
Itâ€™s boring! Now I am afraid that I will go home and get stuck in the same way that I will never have a life as exciting as the one I am leading now.
How do I move back to the US and still have a life that is always exciting and new and never stagnant? Reply Theresa June 19 2009 at 620 am I think itâ€™s unfair to say that your friends at home are not changing or growing or moving on with their lives unless you have some really amazingly static friends.
My friends at home arenâ€™t changing growing or moving on in the way that I am but they are for the most part going down paths that appeal to them.
Theyâ€™re becoming wives and husbands and fathers and mothers theyâ€™re getting PhDs or Master degrees theyâ€™re succeeding at jobs that are important to them theyâ€™re volunteering with organizations they care about.
Their dreams arenâ€™t my dreams but my dreams arenâ€™t their dreams.
Life may seem the same to us when we get home but I think most of my friends will think their lives have changed often in ways significant to them since we left.
I think travel is wonderful and important and I would encourage everyone to do it but I think sometimes us travelers get a superiority complex thinking our choice is better than othersâ€™ choices.
I agree with Matt that you shouldnâ€™t let fear keep you from travelingâ€”if traveling is what you want to do.
Reply NomadicMatt June 22 2009 at 153 pm The travel path isnâ€™t for everyone but having no fear and living without regrets is something that can be applied to all.
Reply Jac June 17 2009 at 1100 pm I sort of agreeâ€¦ I didnâ€™t travel until my thirties.
Then I did it big time.
I got so much more out of it than I would have done in my twenties.
And while I was at home in my twenties I was busy learning lots of things about life and love that Iâ€™m really glad I learned.
I think travel comes and finds you when you need it and youâ€™re ready for it.
Do it too soon and you donâ€™t get as much out of it although it is always amazing!.
But do it when youâ€™re ripe for it and it changes your life.
Great post.
Thought provoking for me.
ð?™‚ J Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1226 am very good points Reply Rachael June 18 2009 at 340 am Good post.
Having moved a lot as a kid I was used to goodbyes and was lucky to not feel these fears about studying abroad numerous times in college semesters in both Florence and Bangkok as well as a summer in Sydney.
However I have just graduated am dating a guy from Sweden who will be leaving me in the States and returning to his homeland in August and am contemplating saving up for the next six or so months for a yearlong RTW trip.
But now I am experiencing fears for the first time.
Before I always knew I wasnâ€™t leaving behind or sacrificing too much and that things would be the same.
Now I feel I am facing the sacrifice of a future career and/or prioritizing an important relationship.
Tough stuff! This article reminded me though of my fearlessness in the past and encourages me to be strong and push toward my dream! Thanks! Reply John Bardos June 18 2009 at 630 am I was exactly the same in University as well.
It is easy to make excuses to delay what we really want out of life.
Travel starting a business committing to a relationship following your dreams all have the same problem an uncertain future.
Uncertainty is scary so people continue the same boring things they did yesterday and the day before.
Travel reinvented who I am as a person.
It completely opened my eyes to a whole world and different ways of living.
The best advice I can offer is JUST GO! Reply Leyla June 18 2009 at 525 am Hi Matt This really resonates.
I wasnâ€™t exactly scared of what I might miss but I was scared I would miss the â€˜career boatâ€™ if I traveled after graduation.
Iâ€™d traveled before but never on an extended solo backpacking trip which is what I so desperately wanted to do.
Instead I was a good girl got a job rose through the ranks and all that â€“ and finally at 43 it caught up with me â€“ I quite the job gave everything away bought a backpack and a one-way ticket and took off for six months.
I came back three years later after crossing Africa and Asia.
So itâ€™s never too late! And even when I returned I was able to jump back on the career wagon without any trouble â€“ chances are I would have found a job after my travels the first-time around too.
Amazing what fear can do! Reply Rob June 18 2009 at 532 am Accurate article I get regular â€˜updatesâ€™ from home and they seem to be the same every week The temperature whoâ€™s ill whatâ€™s on TV.
Thatâ€™s it.
In terms of missing things I found it works in the opposite way too people thought theyâ€™d miss me and Iâ€™d pretty much be out of touch but thanks to the internet communication is easy as itâ€™s ever been even on a big scale so connections with home is just not a problem.
Reply Jonathan June 18 2009 at 1118 am This blog reminds me of a quote that I heard last summer.
It went something like this everyone has a disability.
Itâ€™s called comfort zone.
It prevents people from broadening and deepening their lives with new experiences knowledge information and stories.
Travelling can help one to knock down the walls of oneâ€™s comfort zone.
Reply Gillian June 18 2009 at 244 pm I donâ€™t have any regrets as I agree the path I have taken has brought me here.
But I have finally â€˜grown the ballsâ€™ to do the travel that I have always wanted and like â€˜Scribetrotterâ€™ and at 41 we have also sold our house packed up all our stuff and set out on a trip that I had never imagined.
We all do whatâ€™s right at the time.
I may be older than all the others at the hostel today but I know that itâ€™s never too late!! Reply NomadicMatt June 20 2009 at 123 am In the movie A Map for Saturday Brook finds a 74 your old staying at the hostel! Reply Anthony June 18 2009 at 305 pm Itâ€™s a funny thing about cominâ€™ home.
Looks the same smells the same feels the same.
Youâ€™ll realize whatâ€™s changed is you.â€? Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1232 am great quote!! good to see you here too! Reply Anthony June 19 2009 at 636 pm Buddy Iâ€™m getting that itch againâ€¦ something is going downâ€¦ soon! Reply Jason June 18 2009 at 940 pm Matt I think this is one of the most important aspects in life.
Sometimes what we want most we fear most.
Reply Aimee June 19 2009 at 107 am Thank you so much for posting this.
I just graduated from high school and am preparing to move to London to go to a university there while most of my friends are headed to state schools that are only a couple of hours away.
Lately Iâ€™ve been experiencing the fear you describe in that I donâ€™t want to leave even though I know itâ€™s what I need to do at this point in my life and I know that if I donâ€™t go that I would regret it the moment I step foot on some other college campus.
I really am afraid of missing out but after reading your post and all the comments it seems as if my friends are the ones missing out! Thanks again!   Reply NomadicMatt June 20 2009 at 124 am Iâ€™m glad this timely post was the push you needed! I expect lots of stories from the road! Reply Amy June 19 2009 at 214 am This is a great post.
I agree that donâ€™t let fear holding you back on seeing the world.
For me I was traveling in the opposite direction.
Moving to the States was probably one of the most terrifying and amazing experience at the same time in my life.
But I have no regret.
Reply JoAnna June 19 2009 at 1150 pm I always regretted not studying abroad too.
I had the program picked out and the application completed but I never sent it in.
I had the same fears you did and Iâ€™ve always wished I had taken that leap of faith.
Because of that and because I realize we only live once Iâ€™m really trying hard to do the thing that might seem scary especially if it is the right thing to do.
Logic says no my heart says yes.
More and more Iâ€™m listening to my heart.
How can I not? Reply Franny June 22 2009 at 1252 pm Hi Matty! Hope youâ€™ve been enjoying your time at home ð?™‚ As someone who has lived abroad for extended periods twice in my life a semester in college and a year after college and now living as one of your friends who is home and â€˜nothing has changedâ€™ I have to say I agree with Theresa â€“ ya gotta give us more credit! Isnâ€™t that always true in life you feel internally like youâ€™re growing and changing and othersâ€™ lives are only staying the same no matter who you are or what youâ€™re doing? I might have the same job as I did before but it in no way means I havenâ€™t experience as much growth this year as you have even if you canâ€™t tell from the outside much like i might not be able to tell how youâ€™ve changed this year â€“ there goes Matt still vagabonding what has changed? I realized I have now gotten off topic of what your original point was â€“ to let go of fear and realize your life isnâ€™t going anywhere.
I obviously completely agree but I just wanted to defend those of us who are learning how to have internal growth even though now weâ€™re back at home.
ð?™‚ Reply NomadicMatt June 22 2009 at 151 pm Itâ€™s not so much you havenâ€™t grown as a person- I canâ€™t say you have or havenâ€™t and I wouldnâ€™t be egotistical enough to make that assumption but ask people whatâ€™s new and they say nothing.
Even when you inquire deeper people still have nothing newâ€? to share.
I think that is telling.
Itâ€™s not true for 100% of the people but in general it seems to be the case.
People are still following the same american dream path they were in the beginning.
Reply Anne June 22 2009 at 844 pm studying abroad is the #1 piece of advice i give any young person i meet.
i was lucky enough to have 2 semesters abroad â€“ one in paris and the other on a ship around the world â€“ both were very different but both will stick with me always.
iâ€™m glad that youâ€™ve had more than your fair share of travel even if you didnâ€™t study abroad.
long live travel! anne Reply jen laceda June 25 2009 at 419 pm I donâ€™t know how I have missed this post! Totally missed this from the feed.
Anyway Fear is indeed a powerful thing.
Trust me I know what youâ€™re saying.
Iâ€™ve been unhappy at my job for the last year or so after coming back from maternity leave which I didnâ€™t get my old job back-they gave me something stupid to do-colleagues think i should file a womanâ€™s rights case- thatâ€™s another story though.
Anyway so Terence Carter photographer told me to find the things I CANâ€™T not do which is TRAVEL write & photography.
So I want to do a career swticheroo but fear is holding me back.
What about my sweet hospital pension? my healthcare benefits? etc etc.
Can you smell the fear? But when I read posts like these I feel empowered and inspired and scared at the same time because it makes me want to take that leap now! Reply Judith September 1 2009 at 1054 pm Traveling can provide us insights about the other parts of the world.
This can be one of the way for us to grow and to learn also our independence.
Although you might miss something in your own hometown while your away but the experience is worth the trade off.
Reply Calvin September 23 2009 at 950 pm Sometimes traveling to another place or country is worthy than the things that weâ€™ll miss in our hometown.
There could be lots of things that youâ€™ll discover out there and you have the opportunity to meet different kinds of people.
Reply John C December 22 2009 at 834 am I have just seen this blog and everything nomadicmatt says is very true.
I just got back 4 days ago after travelling Thailand and Australia for 9 months.
I put it off years ago when I just finished uni in London went to my home town and got a job.
In March of 2009 I just went quit the sh** job and had the best 9 months of my life.
I just wished Iâ€™d done it when I was 21 not 27.
When I was out there I always missed my group of friends and my family people were getting married and I missed out on a few things.
I was very homesick and always thinking I wished I was hanging with them.
So I came back 4 days ago to pay off a few debts and yep it feels like Iâ€™ve never left.
People are still the same and Iâ€™ve got my old job back as a temp.
I just think that Iâ€™m picking where I left off.
Buts its true that nothing changes back home.
Nice blog!! Reply NomadicMatt December 22 2009 at 1041 pm Thanks for the compliments! Reply Mike May 29 2012 at 1241 pm Hey hows it going? I just came back from a two and half months stay in SE Asia.
While I loved it I came back with empty pockets and no job.
Since then I been working and planning on going back to school.
Now I am looking for a University that offers that an exchange program so I can do what everyone else here is doing.
Thanks for everybodyâ€™s input! Iâ€™m going to try my best to do something amazing! Reply kevinn g August 11 2013 at 526 pm the only thing worse than not doing it is wasting more time having â€˜regretsâ€™ about it .
artificially created feelings that cannot change the past.
Once a â€˜time machineâ€™ is perfected perhaps â€˜regretsâ€™ will serve some kind of purpose Reply Rob B October 22 2014 at 553 am I can totally relate to this! Part of me wishes Iâ€™d travelling in my teens and twenties just for the experience of it but as someone above said the fear of what you might lose can really take hold.
I guess knowing very little changes comes from the experience of seeing it not change in front of you.
Now Iâ€™m 31 and despite the regret of not going earlier Iâ€™m smart enough to now have an stronger idea of what I want and need from myself when I go travelling in March.
The regrets will still be there in some way but the future and the past are just a thought what matters is now! Reply Dileshwori Joshi March 25 2020 at 217 am I can very much relate with your story.
I have of fear of trying new things.
I have fear of left alone.
I have a fear of being forgotten.
I have to think thousand times before trying out new things.
I wish I could come out of my comfort zone.
Reply Niks J.
April 9 2020 at 817 am I also had the same feeling when I was in college.
I was afraid of something.
Now travelling.
But plans failed due to some reason.
I have also started writing travel articles and its good to share it.
