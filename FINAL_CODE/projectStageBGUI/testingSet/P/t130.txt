I finally saw the light and came to love it.
London has a million things to do to keep you busy a lifetime over.
With its amazing architecture world-class art museums tons of historical sites and unique shopping experiences whatâ€™s not to love? Whatâ€™s not to love about a city where the pubs are so small everyone just stands on the street with their pint glass?! And from its beautiful gardens to the excitement of Piccadilly Circus thereâ€™s just an energy that canâ€™t be beat.
But London is huge containing more than 8 million people and 48 neighborhoods stretching over 607 square miles.
I mean itâ€™s HUGE.
Any city that warrants a I survived the subwayâ€? T-shirt usually is.
Stay in the wrong neighborhood and youâ€™ll spend hours on the tube.â€? So which are the best neighborhoods and places to stay when you visit London? That depends on a lot of things especially what your idea of fun is.
Each neighborhood has its own charm.
So Iâ€™ll break down the best neighborhoods and accommodations in London for travelers according to me The City of London This is technically the center of London sometimes called The Square Mileâ€? and itâ€™s where the Romans set up a small military outpost named Londinium in 43 CE.
You can still see evidence of the Romans here including the crumbling wall on Tower Hill.
Now the area a financial district.
There are several good markets here like Whitecross Street with its large number of international food vendors the Sunday Upmarket in the Old Truman Brewery for handmade crafts and clothing and Leather Lane for a more traditional mix of everything from leather to tropical flowers.
I like the history quiet and central location of this neighborhood.
Best Places to Stay in The City BUDGET YHA London St Paulâ€™s â€“ Opposite St.
Paulâ€™s Cathedral this was once the school for the cathedralâ€™s choirboys you can actually still see some of their graffiti on the walls.
Thereâ€™s no kitchen on-site but there is a small restaurant and bar.
Itâ€™s not a party hostel as families often stay here.
So itâ€™s ideal for a good nightâ€™s sleep.
MID-RANGE Citadines Barbican London â€“ Renovated in 2017 this hotel is comfortable affordable and close to the Barbican tube stop..
There are some really great restaurants nearby like Tinseltown and Workshop Coffee but there is also a small Sourced Market in the hotel for when you need to grab something to eat on the run.
LUXURY Counting House â€“ The Counting House is actually an iconic English pub with 15 large luxury rooms above it with the most comfortable beds youâ€™ll ever sleep in Egyptian cotton sheets!.
Some rooms come with living rooms.
A free hearty breakfast is included.
This is a very traditional posh British hotel! Kensington/South Kensington If you have come to London to soak up British history or to indulge your love for all things royal this is the neighborhood to be.
Kensington is where Londonâ€™s Museum Quarter is including the Victoria & Albert Museum the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum.
Itâ€™s really close to Hyde Park and the regal Kensington Gardens.
I love to stroll the neighborhood and gaze at the mansion-lined streets.
Itâ€™s quiet quant and classically British.
Best Places to Stay in Kensington/South Kensington BUDGET Astor Hyde Park â€“ This hostel is in a quiet neighborhood right off Hyde Park and within walking distance to the Natural History and the Victoria & Albert Museums.
Thereâ€™s a great social vibe and the friendly hotel staff will help you arrange tours and activities.
Plus the Â£1 breakfast canâ€™t be beat! I love the old wooden dÃ©cor â€” you feel more like youâ€™re in a home than a hostel.
The dorms are huge and thereâ€™s plenty of room to sprawl out.
Try to avoid the rooms on the upper floors though as the hostel has no elevator.
MID-RANGE London Lodge Hotel â€“ You can book single rooms in this bright Victorian townhouse while the executive rooms have more floor space and larger bathrooms.
The rooms are each uniquely decorated to make them feel more like a home with colorful patterned wallpaper and carpeting and vintage furniture.
LUXURY The Ampersand Hotel â€“ The Ampersand is a luxury boutique hotel next to the South Kensington station.
Each beautiful room has a different theme like music or astronomy and if youâ€™re staying on the top floor you get a great view over London.
They do a posh afternoon tea in the drawing rooms and you can play ping-pong in the games room.
Mayfair Mayfair is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London.
Located between Hyde Park and the West End itâ€™s home to numerous five-star hotels classy art galleries and ultra-expensive shops but quiet at night.
If youâ€™re looking to stay in one of the cityâ€™s fancier and more beautiful neighborhoods this is it! Best Places to Stay in Mayfair BUDGET Mermaid Suite Hotel â€“ There are no hostels in this neighborhood but the Mermaid Suite Hotel on Oxford Street is one of the best affordable options.
Youâ€™ll get a private room with an en suite bathroom satellite TV and tea and coffee.
Thereâ€™s also a free continental breakfast.
MID-RANGE Mayfair Guesthouse â€“ Although all the rooms in this guesthouse are private and spacious some have balconies most of them come with shared bathrooms.
Itâ€™s a really good value property for this part of town.
LUXURY The Beaumont Hotel â€“ Walking into the lobby is like stepping back into time.
The walnut-paneled walls are covered in original classic paintings and photography and all the rooms are art deco style with king-sized beds.
The marble bathroom floors are heated.
Take advantage of the sauna steam room fitness center and hammam.
If youâ€™re going to treat yourself to dinner try the fresh lobster at the Colony Grill.
Or you can pretend itâ€™s the 1920s and order a strong whiskey cocktail in the low light of Jimmyâ€™s Bar.
Soho Soho is one of Londonâ€™s most vibrant neighborhoods.
The former red-light district Soho is home to hundreds of restaurants pubs stores all-night coffee shops and theaters.
Itâ€™s eclectic and exciting and Londonâ€™s artistic community thrives here.
I love Soho at night when the pubs here spill onto the street with folks having a pint after work.
Youâ€™re a twenty minute walk from a lot of the main attractions especially the theaters of the West End.
This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city.
Best Places to Stay in Soho BUDGET SoHostel â€“ This large hostel I kept getting lost in the hallways has a rooftop tikiâ€?-style bar nightly drink specials quiz nights live music and karaoke.
It also has a big common space with a restaurant with cheap food like Â£5 pizzas and beer.
The beds are comfy and the showers super clean.
Itâ€™s one of the best hostels in London.
If you book directly with them they often have special rates.
MID-RANGE Mimiâ€™s Hotel Soho â€“ Mimiâ€™s is a newer hotel and its affordability is based on its tiny rooms.
They come in tinyâ€? miniâ€? cozyâ€? and luxâ€? but even the lux rooms are pretty small.
On the other hand thereâ€™s floor heating specially filtered water and really nice marble bathrooms.
The hotelâ€™s on-street bar Hensonâ€™s gets really busy at night.
LUXURY The Soho Hotel â€“ No two guestrooms are the same at the Soho Hotel theyâ€™re also enormous and most have floor-to-ceiling windows.
Thereâ€™s a well-equipped gym and even a personal trainer on-site but if youâ€™d rather take a book to the cozy library and read you can do that too.
There are tons of restaurants bars cafÃ©s and theaters surrounding the hotel and Oxford and Regent Streets are both just a quick walk away.
Covent Garden Covent Garden is just east of Soho.
This is the theater district and is also known for its historic indoor market and throngs of tourists.
There are plenty of street performers and lots of shopping opportunities.
But itâ€™s also a quirky neighborhood with cobblestone streets cool shops restaurants and a historic square.
Itâ€™s also very central.
Best Places to Stay in Covent Garden BUDGET Astor Museum Inn â€“ Like the Astor Hyde Park the dorms rooms here are pretty basic but they arenâ€™t overpriced are clean and thereâ€™s a cozy lounge and kitchen.
Free dinners are also offered frequently.
Itâ€™s not as quaint as the Hyde Park branch but it is a better location.
MID-RANGE Strand Palace Hotel â€“ This hotel has been around since the early 1900s and all its rooms are built around six inner courtyards.
If you want a quiet space ask for a room overlooking the interior.
There are single-room options too if youâ€™re traveling solo and donâ€™t mind a small space.
LUXURY Fielding Hotel â€“ The Fielding Hotel is named for author Henry Fielding and in keeping with the period the building has a lot of 19th-century charm.
The rooms are tiny but they come equipped with large TVs and tea and coffee facilities and some even have claw-foot bathtubs.
The hotel is located across from the Royal Opera House and just five minutes from the famous Covent Garden Market.
Shoreditch/Spitalfields This artsy hip neighborhood in East London is an up and coming neighborhood filled with outdoor markets vintage clothing stores bars and restaurants and itâ€™s one of the best nightlife districts in town.
The abundance of street art contrasts old industrial warehouses and dimly lit streets.
Thanks to the immigrant influence here youâ€™re never too far from a dÃ¶ner kebab or a plate of Peruvian ceviche.

The rooms are spacious and come with exposed brick walls nice seating areas and rainfall showers.
Thereâ€™s a small rooftop pool and the fitness center has daily yoga and cycling classes.
Kingâ€™s Cross/Camden These two neighboring areas are especially popular with backpackers and young Londoners.
Kingâ€™s Cross has a lot of hostels and the canal banks are full of warehouses that have been transformed into restaurants and bars.
Camden has always been a hot spot for the alternative crowd.
Like Shoreditch it has a lot of vintage and unusual shops like Cyberdog the futuristic glow-in-the-dark shop thatâ€™s also part rave.
The waterside Camden Lock Market is quite famous and youâ€™ll definitely find some treasures here.
Best Places to Stay in Kingâ€™s Cross/Camden BUDGET Generator â€“ This is Generatorâ€™s first hostel itâ€™s now a huge chain spread all over Europe and itâ€™s housed in an old police station.
You canâ€™t go wrong with this chain.
Like most of their hostels Generator London has lots of modern upscale fixtures a huge common area a bar and a restaurant no common kitchen though.
The beds are plush but there are not many charging outlets so youâ€™ll have to fight for space.

Southwark This historic district on the south bank of the Thames has a lot going for it.
Tourists flock to the neighborhood as it is home to the Tate Modern and Shakespeareâ€™s Globe Theatre.
There are several food markets but Borough Market is the best especially for foodies.
You canâ€™t miss Londonâ€™s tallest most modern building the Shard.
Make sure to take a walk along the river as itâ€™s a scenic route that affords great views of the city skyline.
You can cross back and forth the Thames via the Tower Millennium or London Bridges.
Best Places to Stay in Southwark BUDGET St.
Christopherâ€™s Inn at the Village â€“ This hostel chain has eight London locations but I like the Village venue the best â€” especially for being so near the Borough Market an absolute haven for foodies.
Itâ€™s also a short walk to the London Eye and Tower Bridge.
This is a pretty big party place with an outdoor terrace and a ton of social events to get you well acquainted with your fellow travelers like regular beer pong nights and musical performances.
Itâ€™s the first hostel in London to have cozy pod-style beds.
They are actually super comfortable and provided one of the best sleeps I had in the city! MID-RANGE The Bridge Hotel â€“ Near London South Bank University and the Tate Modern the Bridge Hotel has a ton of value for money.
The beds are big the linens are soft and the shower pressure is super strong.

Clapham For a long time Clapham was a rundown suburb of London but in recent years Clapham has turned into one of those up-and-coming districts with a constantly improving list of restaurants nightclubs music venues specialty shops and more.
Itâ€™s now one of the hip places to live in the city thanks in part to the cheap rent there! And when the sun is out head to the Clapham Common and join the other Londoners hanging out or picnicking on the grass.
