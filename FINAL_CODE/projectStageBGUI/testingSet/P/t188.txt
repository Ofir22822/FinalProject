It’s laid-back vibe awesome live music scene and rowdy nightlife make it a favorite for backpackers and budget travelers alike.
Whereas many cities Down Under are worth visiting for a few days you could easily spend weeks here without getting bored.
Since it’s a popular spot for budget travelers the city boasts dozens of hostels to cater to the growing tourist numbers.
In my decade-plus of visiting Melbourne the hostel scene here has changed drastically.
There are tons more hostels here than there used to be — and there are lots of upscale and boutique options too.
These days you have so many choices it can be overwhelming.
Over the years I’ve stayed in dozens upon dozens of hostels here.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Melbourne are Location – Melbourne is a big city and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price – In Melbourne you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Melbourne that I like the most.

United Backpackers United Backpackers has everything I Iike in a hostel it’s affordable has comfortable dorms and private rooms is secured by key-card entry has a kitchen and dining room includes free breakfast with pancakes and has tons of places to relax and hang out.
Its basement bar hosts events throughout the week and there’s also a TV room and a common area with a pool table.
The hostel also offers a free walking tour of the Central Business District CBD which is packed with street art restaurants bars and clubs.
This hostel is large so it’s easy to meet people as well.
However since it’s so large there are occasional lines for the bathroom and the hot water can run out in the morning so wake up early or shower at night.
If you’re staying in a dorm choose one of the smaller ones — the 12-bed dorm can get crowded.
Located across from Flinders Street Station it’s easy to get anywhere in the city.
It’s also just a seven-minute walk to Eureka Skydeck which provides amazing views of the city.
