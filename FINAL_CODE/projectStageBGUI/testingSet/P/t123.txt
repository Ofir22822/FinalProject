Boston has been a commercial hub since the 17th century and holds an important place in American history.
After the Boston Tea Party in 1773 it became a pivotal bastion of support for the US War of Independence.
Even today the city is brimming with history and has lots to offer.
It’s a must-visit destination for anyone looking to understand the roots of modern America.
Since it isn’t the most affordable destination budget-conscious travelers and backpackers are probably going to want to save money however they can.
That means finding budget-friendly accommodation.
Like most US cities Boston doesn’t have many hostels.
But the ones it does have are modern clean safe and social for the most part.
That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Boston are Location – Boston is a big city and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price – In Boston you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Boston that I like the most.

Boston Fenway Inn The Boston Fenway Inn is the cheapest hostel in town.
But you get what you pay for so expect basic accommodations.

Breakfast is included but is quite basic toast and coffee unless you wake up early and grab pastries before they’re gone.
It also doesn’t have a full kitchen and the common room is set up with tables and chairs so it’s not super comfy.

FOUND Hotel Boston Common FOUND Hotel Boston Common is one of the oldest hotels in the city.
Renovated in 2018 it has much more of a hotel feel to it.

But it’s a short walk to Boston Common and the Public Garden and has plenty of restaurants bars and clubs nearby.
It’s also just over one block from the subway so it’s easy to get to other attractions in town.
If you want a place that’s quiet tidy comfortable and not particularly social then book your stay here.

The beds aren’t the most comfortable but the quiet location makes it easier to fall asleep than in other hostels in the heart of the city.
