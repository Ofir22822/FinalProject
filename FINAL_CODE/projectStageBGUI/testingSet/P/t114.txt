But I was wrong.
Dead wrong.
Budapest turned out to be a vibrant city with a rich history beautiful parks and buildings bustling food halls cool underground bars and centuries-old thermal baths.
There was indeed a lot to do.
Since then Iâ€™ve been back many times and have even led tours there.
I love how Budapestâ€™s drab exterior hides an inner warmth.
Itâ€™s hip.
Itâ€™s cool.
There is so much more to the city if you can look beyond its concrete faÃ§ade.
Do that and youâ€™ll be rewarded with a visit to one of the best destinations on the continent.
Budapest is actually two cities straddling the Danube Buda on the west side is hilly and classy while Pest pronounced peshtâ€? on the east is its flatter wilder neighbor.
A third Ã“buda merged with the others in 1873.
Each part has its own personality as if the river not only divides the city geographically but metaphysically too.
To help you plan your visit to this marvelous Central European capital Iâ€™ve created this itinerary with the best things to see and do in Budapest taking you on â€” and off â€” the beaten path so you not only check out the main sights but you also get to know the locals and culture too.
Budapest Itinerary Highlights Day 1 Castle Hill National Gallery Fishermanâ€™s Bastion & more! Day 2 Parliament Great Market Hall Ruin Bars & more! Day 3 GellÃ©rt Hill Cave Church Terror Museum & more! Budapest Itinerary Day 1 Since Budapest is so neatly divided itâ€™s best to tackle each half separately.
Today weâ€™re going to start with the Buda west side of the Danube.
This is the upper-class ritzy area â€” complete with a castle â€” and itâ€™s filled with lots of museums historic streets parks and regal homes.
To kickstart your trip start your visit with a free walking tour! Take a Free Walking Tour I love free walking tours.
If youâ€™ve read some of my other posts you probably know that already since Iâ€™m always recommending them.
They give you a wonderful way to get an overview of a place learn about its culture and orient yourself.
Budapest has a number of good tours.
Check these out and be sure to tip your guide! Strawberry Tours Trip to Budapest Generation Tours After the free walking tour which will last about three hours head over to Castle Hill.
Tour Castle Hill This area has a lot of charm with cobblestone streets and narrow alleys running through the Old Town.
There are panoramic views of Pest and the Danube great cafÃ©s and restaurants and shops to explore.
The cheapest and easiest way to get up the hill is on the No.
16 bus.
The funicular is another option but it usually has a lengthy wait.
I actually prefer walking as I donâ€™t think the hill is that steep.
Once there explore some of the sights listed below Buda Castle They call it a castle but itâ€™s more of a palace complex than anything else.
Though it was originally constructed in the 13th century the huge Baroque complex you see today was built between 1749 and 1769.
The palaceâ€™s days of being a luxurious living space ended in World War II though when Nazi and then Russian troops looted it.
Today itâ€™s home to a collection of museums see below.
Beneath the castle Vlad the Impaler who we know colloquially as Count Dracula was imprisoned for 14 years.
In the dungeon area there is a labyrinth that tourists used to be able to explore though itâ€™s now closed which is too bad because it was really neat!.
Szent GyÃ¶rgy tÃ©r 2 +36 1 458 3000 budacastlebudapest.com.
The courtyards are open 24/7 while the castle has hours that align with the museum and gallery below.
Admission to the labyrinth is 3000 HUF for adults with discounts available for students and seniors.
Budapest History Museum This museum covers four floors of Buda Castle and will really give you a comprehensive overview of the cityâ€™s entire history plus the views across town are amazing!.
It has some rooms that date back to the 15th century and you can also explore the old cellar which also dates to the 15th century.
Personally I really liked the 1000 Years of Budapestâ€? area.

Admission is free on national holidays.
Hungarian National Gallery Opened in 1957 this museum focuses on Hungarian artists and history of which I knew very little before my visit.
There are a lot of treasures here besides the paintings and sculptures you can see a collection of altarpieces from the 1400s and tour the buildingâ€™s dome.
To see what new temporary exhibits are on display check the website.

Admission is 1800 HUF with discounts for students and seniors and an additional charge for taking pictures.
Audio guides are available for 800 HUF.
Hospital in the Rock This museum is underneath Castle Hill and just a five-minute walk from the castle.
It has a fascinating history having served as a hospital bomb shelter prison and nuclear bunker.
Youâ€™ll learn about World War II the 1956 revolution and the Cold War.
It opened as a museum in 2008 and is one of the most popular attractions in town.
Thereâ€™s a one-hour guided tour complete with wax figures tools equipment and furnishings! Lovas ut 4/c  +36 70 701 0101 sziklakorhaz.eu/en.
Open daily 10am-8pm.
Admission is 4000 HUF for adults with discounts available for seniors and anyone under 19.
Matthias Church This neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church is not what you might expect.
Iâ€™ve seen hundreds of churches and cathedrals across Europe and this one is unique.
The colorful roof almost looks like it was built from Legos.
The original church was built in the 11th century though nothing remains of it.
The current building was constructed in the 14th century though it saw significant renovations in the 19th century.
Once inside youâ€™ll notice the vaulted ceilings and ornate dÃ©cor.
It was a mosque for a while which explains its vibrant colors and painted designs that arenâ€™t the norm in European churches.
SzenthÃ¡romsÃ¡g tÃ©r 2 +36 1 355 5657 matyas-templom.hu.
Open 9am-5pm on weekdays 9am-1pm on Saturdays and 1pm-5pm on Sundays.
Admission is 1800 HUF for adults with discounts for students and seniors.
Guided tours are available for 2500 HUF.
Fishermanâ€™s Bastion This ornate fairytale structure faces Pest and provides great panoramic views across the Danube River.
Built between 1895 and 1902 the terrace comprises seven lookout towers that represent the seven Hungarian tribes who founded Budapest.
It was designed by the same architect who constructed the Matthias Church next door.
The name comes from either the fact that the terrace overlooks the fishermenâ€™s guild or that the fishermenâ€™s guild actually was responsible for protecting that area of the wall â€” no one is quite certain.
SzenthÃ¡romsÃ¡g tÃ©r +36 1 458 3030 fishermansbastion.com.
Open daily 9am-11pm.
Admission is free with an additional charge of 1000 HUF 500 HUF for students/seniors to visit the upper turrets.
Hungarian Presidential Palace The home of the Hungarian president is called SÃ¡ndor-palota Alexander Palace.
It is not super eye-catching compared to the surrounding buildings but if you time it right you can see the changing of the guard ceremony at the top of each hour from 9am to 5pm excluding Sundays.
If youâ€™re really lucky in the summer the palace will be open for tours though this rarely happens.
Szent GyÃ¶rgy tÃ©r 1-2 +36 1 224 5000.
Admission to the changing of the guard is free.
There is an additional fee for palace admission when available.
Buda Tower This reconstructed towerâ€? is all that remains of the Church of Mary Magdalene which was built in the 13th century but nearly destroyed during an air raid in World War II.
When the Turks occupied the city between 1541-1699 it was used as a mosque.
Since reopening in 2017 you can now climb the 172 steps to the top but given the great free views on Castle Hill Iâ€™d skip it and just view the tower from the outside.
KapisztrÃ¡n tÃ©r 6 budatower.hu/en.
Open daily 10am-6pm but only on the weekends in January and February.
Admission is 1500 HUF for adults and 600 HUF for students.
Budapest Itinerary Day 2 Today letâ€™s tackle the Pest eastern side of town Visit Parliament This massive building on the Danube is where the Hungarian legislature meets.
The literal translation means House of the Nationâ€? or House of the Country.â€? After the three cities that make up modern Budapest Buda Pest and Ã“buda united in 1873 it was decided that a new parliament building was needed.
This massive structure took 19 years to build with construction finishing in 1904.
Not only is it the tallest structure in Budapest but itâ€™s actually the largest in the entire country.
These days you can tour the Gothic Revival edifice and watch the changing of the guard.
I recommend purchasing your tickets in advance as the lines to buy tickets on-site can be incredibly long.
Kossuth Lajos tÃ©r 1-3 +36 1 441 4000 parlament.hu.
Open daily 8am-6pm.
Admission is 6000 HUF for non-EU adults 3100 HUF for non-EU students 2400 HUF for EU adults and 1300 HUF for EU students.
Stroll Along the Danube A walk along the river is a nice activity after visiting Parliament.
Head south and check out the promenade and its many green spaces and sculptures including the sobering Shoes on the Danube Bankâ€? a memorial honoring the Jews who were shot here during World War II.
Walk Across the Chain Bridge Continuing south youâ€™ll reach the SzÃ©chenyi Chain Bridge connecting Pest with Buda.
This wrought-iron and stone suspension bridge is 375m in length.
It opened in 1849 though it had to be rebuilt after World War II.
At the Pest east end of the Chain Bridge is the Gresham Palace a beautiful Art Nouveau building.
It was once a luxurious office/apartment building and is now a luxurious hotel the Four Seasons.
Eat at the Great Market Hall Built in 1897 this is the oldest and largest indoor market in the country a bit southwest of the Jewish Quarter.
Youâ€™ll find mostly produce meats baked goods and candy on the ground floor while the upper floor is home to restaurants and souvenir shops.
It has a lot of traditional places to eat so be sure to walk around and explore first.
Sure itâ€™s touristy itâ€™s the central market after all! but I still found the food tasty.
My favorites are the shops on the second floor on the right side closest to the front.
VÃ¡mhÃ¡z kÃ¶rÃºt 1â€“3.
Open Monday 6am-5pm Tuesday-Friday 6am-6pm  and Saturday 6am-3pm.
Closed on Sundays.
Admission is free.
Gaze at St.
Stephenâ€™s Basilica This is the largest church in Hungary and canâ€™t be missed.
It is beautiful inside and out with ornate architecture gorgeous artwork sparkling marble and a tall dome.
No wonder it took 50 years to build! If you go inside check out all the little chapels and St.
Stephenâ€™s mummified hand.
If youâ€™re there on a Monday you can go to an organ concert.

Open weekdays 9am-5pm Saturday 9am-1pm and Sunday 1pm-5pm.
Entry to the basilica is by donation though itâ€™s 600 HUF per person for the tower/observation deck.
Check out DohÃ¡ny Street Synagogue Also known as the Great Synagogue this is the second-largest synagogue in the world built in 1854 and seating 3000 people.
Make sure you go on the guided tour included with admission to get more perspective on the building.
The guides are super knowledgeable and youâ€™ll learn about the construction of the synagogue Jewish life during wartime and a lot more.
Also check out Wallenberg Memorial Park right behind the synagogue and the nearby Hungarian Jewish Museum.

2 +36 1-343-0420.
Hours vary from month to month call ahead for details.
Admission is 4000 HUF for adults and 3000 HUF for students.
See the Hungarian State Opera House You can go inside this neo-Renaissance masterpiece or just view it from outside.
I recommend the latter as the auditorium is being renovated and the tour does not cover much of the building.
If there are performances while you are in town try to catch one.
It may even cost less than a tour! AndrÃ¡ssy u.

Party at the Ruin Bars Ruin bars are all the rage in Budapest and have been around since the 2001 founding of Szimpla Kert the mecca of all ruin bars.
They are in Budapestâ€™s District VII neighborhood the old Jewish Quarter in the ruins of abandoned buildings stores or lots.
This neighborhood was left to decay after World War II so it was a perfect place to develop an underground bar scene.
Not so underground anymore though! From the outside these bars look like normal homes.
They donâ€™t have large signs pointing the way you donâ€™t hear any loud noise and thereâ€™s no line of people waiting to get in.
Here are my favorites Szimpla Kert â€“ This is the original and most famous ruin bar and started this trend.
Once an abandoned factory it has a large open courtyard a top floor with eclectic furniture cocktail bars and even an old stripped-down Trabant Communist-era car you can have a drink in.

Budapest Itinerary Day 3 Explore GellÃ©rt Hill Start your day back in Buda with a trip to GellÃ©rt Hill south of Castle Hill.
This hill offers the best views of Budapest and itâ€™s a popular spot to watch a sunset from.
If you go for the sunset take a flashlight for the trip home! There are several monuments on the hill that youâ€™ll want to stop and appreciate Liberty Statue â€“ This bronze statue was erected in 1947 to celebrate the liberating Soviet forces who defeated the Nazis.
Itâ€™s 14m tall and sits on a 26m pedestal.
When Hungary adopted democracy in 1989 the transcription and meaning of the statue was changed to reflect this.
Statue of Queen Elisabeth â€“ This statue is dedicated to the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary Elisabeth who married Franz Joseph I Emperor of Austria.
Statue of King Saint Stephen â€“ This statue is dedicated to Hungaryâ€™s first king who reigned from 1000 to 1038 CE.
He helped establish the country as a Christian nation and provided a period of relative peace and stability.
Szent GellÃ©rt Monument â€“ This monument is dedicated to Saint Gerard who was the first Bishop of CsanÃ¡d in what was the Kingdom of Hungary in 1030 CE.
He kicked off the conversion of Hungary to Christianity and a monument was constructed in his honor in 1904.
See the Cave Church Aside from these picturesque statues and the epic view GellÃ©rt Hill is home to the most unusual church in the city.
In the 1920s monks built this church in a cave that had been previously used by a hermit monk.
It was used as a hospital during World War II and the Communist government covered the entrance in concrete after the war and executed the head monk.
Thereâ€™s a lot more to the history of this church than I have room to cover here so make sure to use the audio guide.

The building was used by the Ã?VH Secret Police and Arrow Cross Party the Hungarian Nazi party.
The permanent exhibits are spread over four floors and house all sorts of old propaganda weapons and informative multimedia displays.
Over 700000 Hungarians were killed or imprisoned by the Soviets and the museum does a good job at illustrating just how dreadful their daily lives were.
For information on the temporary exhibits check the website for the most up-to-date information.

Tour Heroesâ€™ Square At the end of AndrÃ¡ssy Avenue is the largest square in Hungary.
Its centerpiece is the Millennial Memorial and the statues of Hungarian kings and other historical figures including the seven chiefs who led the Magyars modern-day Hungarians in the 9th century CE.
The monument was built in 1896 to celebrate Hungaryâ€™s 1000th anniversary.
At this time Hungary was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled by the Hapsburgs and space was left for statues of future Hapsburg leaders.
The square is at the entrance to City Park where you can visit the zoo and the SzÃ©chenyi Baths see below if thereâ€™s time.
The Museum of Fine Arts and the Palace of Art are located nearby as well making for interesting stops if youâ€™re interested in art.
Soak at the Baths Hungarians love their thermal spa baths.
Budapest has more than 100 mineral hot springs that have been put to good use since Roman times.
With 18 pools the SzÃ©chenyi Baths in City Park are the largest and most famous in Europe.
The stunning yellow buildings were built in 1913 and itâ€™s a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.

You can typically rent towels and lockers.
Other Things to See and Do in Budapest If you have more than three days in Budapest youâ€™re in luck.
There are plenty of other activities to fill your time.
Visit an Island For a unique experience visit an island on the Danube.
Here are the ones I like best Margaret Island â€“ This popular island is smack in the middle of the Danube connected by the Margaret and Ã?rpÃ¡d Bridges.
Visitors mainly tour the park visit the swimming pools and watch the Musical Fountain which sprays water high into the air in sync with the music.
There are also some dance clubs which are especially busy on the weekends.
Ã“buda Island â€“ This island is known for its outdoor activities including wakeboarding jet skiing and golf on the driving range.
It comes alive in August when thousands of people visit for the Sziget Festival of music and culture and a casino will soon open.
Visit the House of Houdini Harry Houdini was one of the most famous and well-known illusionists in the world.
He was known of his elaborate escape tricks and he was actually born in Hungary.
This is the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Budapest native.
