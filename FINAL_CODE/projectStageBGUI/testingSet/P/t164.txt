They are stunning important historical sites to see and experience.
But the city also offers lots of fun things to do that have fewer crowds and are a bit off the beaten path.
As important as it is to visit culturally significant historical sites after all thereâ€™s nothing wrong with being a tourist there is so much more to every destination than just the main tourist bullet points.
Of course you shouldnâ€™t miss Istanbulâ€™s major sites.
But once youâ€™ve done them there are plenty of offbeat things to see and do here.
Here are my favorites to help you get started and make the most out of your trip 1.
Descend into the Basilica Cistern Most travelers walk on top of this ancient cavern for days without realizing it.
After entering an unassuming doorway youâ€™ll climb down a gloomy set of stairs ending up in an underground former water reservoir built in the sixth century.
Itâ€™s filled with centuries-old columns and statues and the space is eerily lit in shades of orange.
Koi fish swim in the standing water and you have to walk on wooden planks to get around.
You can hear drips echoing and there are two mysterious statues with the head of Medusa.
It kind of feels like youâ€™re in a scary movie.
Alemdar Yerebatan Cd.
1/3 +90 212-512-1570 yerebatansarnici.com.
Open daily from 9am-530pm except religious holidays.
Admission is 20 TRY for foreigners.
2.
Explore the Asian Side Istanbul is the only city in the world to straddle two continents it spans from Europe to Asia.
The Asian side also called the Anatolian side is separated from the European side by the Bosphorus Strait.
You can take a bus over the famous Bosphorus Bridge or you can ride over on a ferry.
The cityâ€™s main tourist sites are on the European side but if youâ€™ve never been to Asia itâ€™s fun to cross over so you can say youâ€™ve been there.
If youâ€™re interested in shopping check out the popular markets in KadikÃ¶y.
Other worthy activities include touring the Beylerbeyi Palace riding up to the top of Ã‡amlica Hill for incredible views of the city and strolling along Bagdat Caddesi to explore the many restaurants cafÃ©s and shops.
The ferry will cost 3 TRY for a one-way ticket.
3.
Visit a Real Hammam Picture not availableâ€”everyone was naked inside! Many of the swanky hotels in Istanbul have hammams otherwise known as Turkish baths but they usually arenâ€™t the real deal.
Theyâ€™re made for Westerners looking for a cushy and modest experience.
Real hammams have been a Turkish tradition for thousands of years and they have served as both a place to cleanse and to socialize.
Most hammams are separated by gender and women generally go topless.
You transition through several different rooms of different temperatures one being a hot steam room much like a sauna.
You can opt to pay an attendant to give you a thorough scrub-down â€” itâ€™s rough but invigorating! Ã‡emberlitai Hamami is a good option for visitors looking to give the experience a try another popular one is Cagaloglu.
Both are located in the Old Town.
Vezirhan Cad.
No.
8 +90 552-381-1584 cemberlitashamami.com.
Open daily from 6am-12am.
Admission starts at 160 TRY per person and goes up from there depending on what treatments/services you want.
4.
Go to the Prince Islands This chain of nine islands off the coast of Istanbul provides a unique getaway from the crowds.
An easy day trip during the warm months the islands are just a quick ferry ride from the city.
Most travelers visit the four larger islands BÃ¼yÃ¼kada the biggest and most popular Burgazada Heybeliada and Kinaliada.
You can explore historic buildings eat at tasty cafÃ©s and see beautiful homes as you wander about.
What makes these islands special is that no cars are allowed on the islands making them quite peaceful and quiet and a nice break from the noise of the city.
You can get around by walking bicycle or horse and carriage.
Try to take one of the early ferries in the day so you explore the islands before our visitors arrive.
The journey by ferry will take around 1 hour and 30 minutes depending on what island you are going to.
Tickets are 5 TRY per person for a single journey ticket.
5.
Take a Ferry A great way to explore this massive city is by boat.
Youâ€™ll see many boats that offer paid tours of the Bosphorus but if you want to save money and have more flexibility take a regular ferry ride instead.
The fare will be cheaper and you wonâ€™t be competing for space with other tourists trying to take photos.
Youâ€™ll pass by Topkapi Palace the Bosphorus Bridge gorgeous mansions mosques with massive minarets other castles and palaces and more.
You can hop off eat some fresh seafood and then head back.
Itâ€™s a budget-friendly way to explore without bumping into other tourists.
Round-trip ferry tickets will cost 25 TRY per person.
6.
Explore Jewish History While Turkey is predominantly a Muslim country it has a surprisingly long Jewish history.
There are Jewish heritage tours you can take or you can explore the stops on your own.
Jews have lived in Turkey for thousands of years but the population really grew during the Ottoman Empire in the 1400s.
Growth increased in 1492 when Spain expelled its Jews and the Ottoman Empire welcomed them as they were stereotyped as having good business skills and wealth.
Istanbulâ€™s Galata and Balat quarters are steeped in Jewish history and you can find historic synagogues in both areas of town.
Istanbul also has a Jewish museum The Museum of Turkish Jews that does a good job of illustrating the contributions and struggles of Jews in Turkey.
Bereketzade Mahallesi +90 212-292-6333 muze500.com.
Open Sunday-Thursday from 10am-5pm and Fridays from 10am-1pm closed Saturdays.
Admission is free though donations are encouraged.
Passport or other official ID is required to enter.
7.
Watch the Fishermen on Galata Bridge Every day dozens if not hundreds of local men form a row along the top level of the Galata Bridge and fish over the edge.
Itâ€™s an incredible sight.
They spend hours hoping to catch fresh seafood and some of them will sell it to you while theyâ€™re still out there fishing.
Many of the men donâ€™t even make a catch they seem to enjoy just standing there hanging their pole over the water.
Thereâ€™s also a fish market at the base of the bridge and the many booths of fresh-caught fish are fun to look at though it can also be a bit gross.
8.
See the Obelisk of Theodosius This Egyptian obelisk was carved around 1500 BCE near Luxor before it was pillaged by the Romans and moved to Alexandria.
Not long after it was moved to Constantinople now Istanbul where it has remained ever since.
There are well-preserved hieroglyphs on all four sides which depict Tutmoses IIIâ€™s victory during a battle on the Euphrates River.
The obelisk is usually surrounded by locals relaxing and chatting and there are often buskers performing here as well.
Itâ€™s a good place to sit back and people-watch while appreciating this incredible historical relic.
9.
Snap a Photo with Tombili Chances are you already know you Tombili is â€” you just donâ€™t realize it.
Tombili was a street cat from Istanbul who went viral in a meme that showed the cat lounging on the stairs like a person would sit on a bench the meme was called chill catâ€? if you want to look it up.
When Tombili died in 2016 the local mayor had a statue commissioned and it now sits where Tombiliâ€™s famous photo was taken.
Thieves immediately stole the statue but after a huge public outcry it was returned.
10.
Visit Miniaturk Miniaturk is a miniature park located in Istanbul â€” and itâ€™s one of the largest miniature parks in the world.
To be honest I didnâ€™t even know what miniature parks were before encountering this place.
In short the park is full of small replicas of famous sights and attractions made to a 1/25 scale.
There are over 100 models in the park including the Obelisk of Theodosius the Mostar Bridge and the Hagia Eirene Church.
The park spans almost 15 acres and there are audio guides available around the park so you can listen and learn more about each individual attraction.
Ã–rnektepe +90 212-222-2882 miniaturk.com.tr.
Open daily from 9am-6pm.
Admission is 15 TRY.
*** Istanbul is a very large and crowded city and it can definitely be intimidating to visit.
But itâ€™s also home to some fascinating history and tons of unique sights and attractions â€” many of which donâ€™t get the attention they deserve.
By adding some of these less-visited attractions into your itinerary youâ€™ll be able to have a much more unique and authentic experience while still being able to see all the wonderful sights that make Istanbul the eclectic beautiful city that it is.
