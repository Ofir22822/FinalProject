Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Whether itâ€™s relaxing on a picturesque beach exploring Mayan ruins or snorkeling the worldâ€™s second longest barrier reef youâ€™ll discover that Belize is full of amazing and adventurous things to do.
The country is one of the most unique destinations in Central America and among my favorite countries in the region.
Itâ€™s also where I did my first solo backpacking trip and since that first trip Iâ€™ve loved every minute Iâ€™ve spent there.
From the Latin culture of the interior to the Caribbean Rasta vibe of the coast to the old English feel of some of the islands Belize is a mash-up of vibrant and historic cultures.
The country is popular with backpackers vacationers dive enthusiasts and honeymooners alike offering something for every travel style and interest.
And tourism is on the rise too.
In 2018 Belize saw an all-time high of 1.5 million visitors â€” which is a lot for a country of just over 40000 people! Tourism will no doubt continue to increase here as Belize is one of the safest countries in the area to visit.
But just because itâ€™s safe doesnâ€™t mean you can let your guard down fully.
Here are some tips to help you stay safe during your visit 9 Safety Tips for Belize 1.
Avoid isolated areas â€“ If youâ€™re somewhere isolated youâ€™ll be at a greater risk for getting robbed especially at night and in the cities.
Try to stay where the crowds are â€” thatâ€™s the best way to avoid being singled out by potential muggers.
2.
Be aware of your surroundings while in crowds â€“ While sticking to where the crowds will help you avoid getting mugged it will also make you a target for petty theft.
Tourists are usually easy targets for pickpockets so when you are in the popular tourist areas make sure your valuables are secure.
3.
Donâ€™t wear flashy items â€“ Petty theft is the most common threat here so remove any jewelry or watches and donâ€™t wave your phone around.
Do your best to blend in so you donâ€™t become a target for pickpockets.
If you happen to find yourself a victim of armed robbery follow the instructions of the robber and give up your valuables these material items can be replaced â€” but your life cannot.
I learned this lesson the hard way in Colombia.
4.
Donâ€™t leave your items unattended â€“ If you are spending the day on the beaches of Placencia Peninsula Hopkins Village or Caye Caulker do not leave your belongings unattended while swimming or walking along the sand as locals and tourists alike can easily swipe your valuables.
If you can find friends at your hostel to hit the beach with so you can take turns watching over each otherâ€™s things while you swim and relax.
5.
Avoid the bus at night â€“ If you need to get somewhere at night take a taxi.
It will be safer than any public transportation.
Have your accommodation call the taxi for you so you can be sure youâ€™re getting a reputable driver.
Make sure you get in a taxi with a green license plate as those indicate authorized taxis.
If youâ€™re a solo female traveler make sure you travel with other people at night even in taxis.
6.
Be careful on public transit â€“ If you must take public transit keep your valuables on you and well secured especially on chicken busesâ€? colorfully decorated school buses that have been converted to public transportation for goods and people.
Theft is common on night buses so avoid them if you can.
Buses also tend to not run on time and sometimes they are extremely slow packed or both.
Be prepared for the experience! 7.
Donâ€™t do drugs â€“ Cartels in Belize have made life very difficult for the local population.
Donâ€™t support them by buying their products.
Drug penalties are also harsh in the region and you donâ€™t want to end up in jail! 8.
Stick to the touristy parts of Belize City â€“ Belize City the largest city has some sketchy neighborhoods that unfortunately have been taken over by local gangs.
There are areas however that are relatively safe such as the main tourist part of town.
If you donâ€™t wander too far from there you should be fine.
9.
Buy travel insurance â€“ Travel insurance will protect you if you get injured or ill are a victim of theft or must deal with delayed or canceled flights.
Itâ€™s a worthwhile investment and can save you thousands of dollars.
Donâ€™t risk traveling without it.
I always buy travel insurance before I leave home â€” a lesson Iâ€™ve learned the hard way! FAQ on Safety in Belize Below are answers to common questions I get on safety in Belize so you can be better prepared for your trip! Is there a risk of Zika in Belize? Belize has a history of Zika virus transmission but there is currently no evidence of an ongoing outbreak.
While the risks are low travelers are advised to take the following precautions Use mosquito repellent on your body on top of any sunscreen to prevent bites and sleep under a mosquito net to avoid getting bit while when youâ€™re asleep.
Wear breathable garments that cover your arms and legs.
Keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to prevent mosquitos from entering your room.
Pregnant women or couples considering pregnancy should consult a healthcare practitioner prior to travel.
Is hitchhiking safe there? Hitchhiking in Belize is quite common easy and â€” most importantly â€” safe.
My friends and I hitchhiked throughout the country and saw lots of locals doing it too.
HitchWiki has a lot of information on hitchhiking in Belize to help you get started.
Is the street food safe? It sure is safe to have street food in Belize! The best and most affordable way to experience the local cuisine is through their street food which has Afro-Caribbean and Mexican cultural influences.
Sample conch fritters ceviche or coconut curry and enjoy the variety of delicious flavors! Is the tap water safe to drink? Belizeâ€™s Ministry of Health has taken steps toward making tap water drinkable for locals.
However during the rainy season some areas experience flooding which may contaminate the tap water.
The best way to make sure your drinking water is safe is to bring a SteriPen or Lifestraw for your reusable water bottle.
This way youâ€™ll be able to purify the tap water so you donâ€™t get sick â€” and avoid single-use plastic bottles in the process.
Are the taxis safe? Taxis are safe â€” and preferred â€” when getting around at night.
You can ask your hostel or hotel to call a taxi for you.
Be sure to get take an authorized taxi they have green license plates.
Use your smartphone and track the route on your offline map and if the driver seems to be going off said route speak up and ask why theyâ€™ve decided to take this direction instead.
At the end of the day always trust your gut if a taxi driver seems shady stop the cab and get out.
If youâ€™re a solo female traveler I suggest traveling with a friend or another traveler at night just to be safe.
Is Belize safe for solo travelers? Solo traveling in Belize is safe although petty theft is one of the most common types of crime in Belize.
The people involved in some sort of incident tend to be drinking or doing drugs or taking part in illegal activity.
If you donâ€™t do it at home donâ€™t do it in Belize! Follow that rule and youâ€™ll be fine.
Is Belize safe for solo female travelers? Belize is a safe place for solo female travelers especially if youâ€™re new to solo travel.
It is one of the safer countries in this region.
However that doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t be careful.
Always be aware of your surroundings and have a downloaded map so you can find your way home.
Donâ€™t flaunt any valuables and avoid taking taxis alone at night.
If youâ€™ve done your research and still have concerns Iâ€™d suggest asking to join other groups at hostels when going out or sticking to group travel or tours just to be safe.

There are 5 Comments Mo October 21 2019 at 458 pm I didnâ€™t have the best luck in Belize despite trying to be extra careful and plan for everything typical that could happen.
Halfway through our trip we went to the well-reviewed Belize zoo and I was attacked/repeatedly bitten by one of their monkeys that had escaped! It was especially ironic as I read on every board like here to not go to the non-touristy parts of Belize City due to safety.
Guess where I was rushed to treat wounds? The bad part of town to the ER.
Iâ€™m not sure if I would or would not recommend Belize bad things could happen anywhere although perhaps some countries have better protocols/laws to protect against the type of negligence on the zooâ€™s part? Anyway I am now a huge believer in travel insurance after this incident.
From my experience World Nomads is very easy to file claims through.
