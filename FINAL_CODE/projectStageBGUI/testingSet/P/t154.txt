Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Bangkok can be an overwhelming destination for tourists and it is depicted in many Western films as seedy gritty and intense with wild nightlife and never-ending traffic.
Most visitors donâ€™t stay there for long but if youâ€™re patient and begin to peel back the layers youâ€™ll discover a complex beautiful city filled with some of the friendliest and most thoughtful people you will ever meet Thailand is called the Land of Smiles for a reason! and delicious street food.
But is Bangkok a safe place to visit? Just like any major city you must be alert and aware of your surroundings but it is pretty safe and the risk of serious danger is very low unless you are up to something illegal.
You are most likely to encounter small scams designed to get a few extra bucks from you more on that later.
Here are a few ways to stay extra safe in Bangkok 1.
Be alert as a pedestrian.
Traffic in Bangkok is chaotic â€” many motorbikes will run red lights or even drive on the sidewalks! â€” so itâ€™s always a good idea to be cautious when crossing the streets and walking around town.
Look both ways and stay alert.
And remember they drive on the left side of the road British side so be sure to look and stay alert! 2.
Carry a photocopy of your passport with you.
This is a no-brainer for anyone who travels overseas.
Put your real passport away in the lockbox provided by your hotel or hostel and carry around a photocopy or a digital version on your phone or in your email.
3.
Never leave your drink unattended.
This is another universal safety tip.
Drinks can be spiked at any moment so always keep yours close or hand it to someone you trust if you need to.
4.
Do not take or accept any recreational drugs.
Thailand has a strict no-drugs policy anyone caught using or carrying illegal substances will go to jail or in rare instances receive the death penalty.
5.
Donâ€™t talk about the royal family.
Under the lÃ¨se majestÃ© law you are forbidden to speak negatively of the king and the royal family.
If you are caught insulting the monarchy you will be sentenced to 3â€“15 years in prison.
Other countries may have lÃ¨se majestÃ© laws but Thailandâ€™s enforcement is the worldâ€™s harshest.
Over the years people have faced lÃ¨se majestÃ© charges over minor offenses a woman who wore black on the kingâ€™s birthday a man who mocked the kingâ€™s dog on the internet and individuals who have liked Facebook posts regarding the king to name a few.
Itâ€™s crucial you not discuss the king or royal family publicly or with locals or you will face major consequences that all the travel insurance in the world will not protect you from! 6.
Buy travel insurance.
No one wants to think about things going wrong on their trip but being prepared and buying travel insurance is something I do before every trip.
You should have it whenever you travel but in a country where petty theft and scams are unfortunately a little more common itâ€™s extra important.
And of course itâ€™s also important for covering any medical or other emergency situation you might encounter.
Be a smart traveler â€” buy travel insurance.
We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70.

Petty theft including bag snatching is the most common type of crime youâ€™ll face.
Also some people will try to rip you off including taxi drivers who refuse to turn on their meters.
Avoiding travel scams requires a lot of common sense and a healthy dose of suspicion.
Also read this post on travel scams to avoid.
Here are the two most common scams to be aware of Taxi scams You hop into a taxi and realize the meter isnâ€™t running.
You mention this to the driver and their response is that the meter is brokenâ€? and he quotes you a price that is outrageously high.
Or you might notice that the meter is working but the fare is increasing as fast as a bullet train in Japan.
To avoid this scam do your research and get an idea of how much a ride should cost from your hostel or hotel staff before hailing a taxi.
In my experience if the cabbie tries to negotiate the rate I use the one quoted to me though my prior research and if he refuses I get out and find someone who will turn the meter on.
Ideally use only taxis with working meters.
If the meter looks as though itâ€™s rising unusually fast ask the driver to pull over and get out immediately.
Another situation you may encounter is your taxi driver taking the scenic route.â€? Youâ€™ll end up sitting in traffic and the cabbie will make money at your expense.
We live in the age of technology so if youâ€™re suspicious of your driverâ€™s route pull your smartphone out and use Google Maps to find the quickest way to your destination.
Better yet find out the optimum route ahead of time.
Donâ€™t hesitate to show the phone to your driver and insist on taking this route.
Download a map of the city using Google Maps or MAPS.ME so you always have access to it offline.
If you end up with a bad taxi experience take a photo of the driverâ€™s ID/registration number and report him to Thailandâ€™s tourism board.
And always always use only official taxis.
The tourist site is closedâ€?/tuk-tuk ride scam This is probably the most common scam in Bangkok.
When visiting tourist attractions often around Wat Phra Kaew the Grand Palace or Wat Arun someone will randomly come up to you and say that the place is closed for a special ceremony or for lunch hour.
Then this overly helpful individual will offer to take you to places that are open.
While touring the attractions the driver will take you to a gem shop a souvenir shop or a tailor where they receive a commission.
A few hours later the driver will drop you off at your original location once itâ€™s reopenedâ€? and by that time youâ€™ve realized that the site was open the entire time â€” you were just in the wrong part of the building.
This is where your good sense and confidence come into play.
Avoid talking to these locals or firmly say no thanksâ€? and walk away.
Or find the main entrance or ticket counter and see for yourself! Another thing to note is that most attractions donâ€™t close for lunch â€” they close for the day.
Look up the hours of operation before you go so you know what to expect â€” opening and closing times are almost always available online.
FAQ on Bangkok Safety Below is a list of some of the common questions I get on safety in Bangkok so you can be better prepared for your trip! Is street food safe? Yes absolutely! Bangkok is considered the street food capital of the world and you will not find a shortage of stalls selling delicious local dishes on every corner.
With that said if there is something that doesnâ€™t smell or look kosherâ€? then it might be best to avoid.
If a street vendor has local customers you can usually trust that itâ€™s safe.
If you are overwhelmed with where to start Iâ€™d recommend reading this blog post on how to tackle the street food culture in Bangkok.
Is the tap water safe? According to the Bangkok Metropolitan Waterworks Authority it follows the World Health Organization standards for providing safe drinking water for the population.
However although the water is treated in plants the pipes it travels through can be very old and dirty which can lead to contamination.
Locals usually boil the tap water first before drinking it or they will purchase bottled water.
Use a Steripen or Lifestraw to ensure that your water is safe to drink.
Also bring a reusable water bottle to cut down on your plastic consumption.
Are taxis safe? Taxis are safe and affordable and my preferred way to get around town.
However you will come across the occasional meter or scenic routeâ€? scam.
When you get into a cab always check that it has a working meter and agree on a route prior to the start of your journey.
If youâ€™ve read the section on taxi scams above you will be well prepared for this type of situation.
Is Bangkok safe for solo travelers? Bangkok is safe for solo travelers and a great first city to solo-travel in.
Iâ€™ve been going there for the past 15 years and have rarely encountered any problems.
However there are areas of Bangkok that are all about partying and drinking and the biggest incidents happen when people are drunk and stupid.
Donâ€™t get too drunk.
Also avoid illegal substances at all cost â€” Thailand is very very strict on drugs and youâ€™re going to be screwed if you get caught.
Always trust your gut instinct if you donâ€™t do it at home donâ€™t do it when youâ€™re in Bangkok.
Is Bangkok safe for solo female travelers? Solo female travelers should feel safe touring the city.
Itâ€™s very easy to meet other travelers especially female ones in Bangkok.
Some precautions and planning are in order though Always have a downloaded map and translation app so you can find your way home or ask for help if you need it.
Donâ€™t flaunt any valuables and avoid taking taxis alone at night.
If youâ€™re still nervous about heading somewhere ask to join a group at your hostel groups are less likely to be victims of scammers or theft and youâ€™ll feel safer that way.
Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel *** Bangkok has an electric energy to it and with its endless supply of things to see and do you will never be bored.

He was really polite though.
And the only taxi I took had meter was taking me straight where I wantedâ€¦ andâ€¦ dropped me *almost* at my destination just a couple streets away right in front of a gem shop.
Not even sure that counts as a scam but it wasâ€¦ unexpected.
ð?™‚ Reply David January 16 2020 at 615 pm Years ago walking around Benjasiri Park and was approached by a non-Thai man Filipino I believe.
Asks where I was from and surprise he has a relative that is going to school in my home town Vancouver.
Gives me his tel.
# and asks me to drop by for some drinks later was on to him however as this is a familiar scam used in several major cities.
Once you show up a drug will be put in your drink and more than likely you will be withdrawing cash from an ATM.
ð?™‚ Try to drop by BKK for a few days explore a new area if not too tired before heading to my NE Thai home.
