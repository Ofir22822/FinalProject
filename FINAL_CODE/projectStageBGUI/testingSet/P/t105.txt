The thing about traveling in summer is there are all the cultural events thenâ€“they are scheduled for maximum tourist season.
So thatâ€™s an upside.
One way to save money on food is to make your main meal at lunch.
Lunch menus are far cheaper than dinner menus.

Like you said Europe can get crazy busy in the summer I prefer to travel around in the winter months.
Not only less crowded but also alot cheaper! Good luck with the tour as well! Reply Gabriel April 16 2017 at 1201 am As someone who has only been to Europe once on a trip that I neither planned nor paid for as a minor this is inspiring and makes me want to plan a new trip of my own.
Iâ€™m a college student so your comments about Switzerland being one of the more expensive destinations is unfortunate but I think I could justify spending a little extra to be back in my favorite place on Earth.
I think I may have to add Mt.
Pilatus to my list of places to goâ€¦ havenâ€™t done enough mountain hiking/climbing in my life.

Someone told me about youth hostels in Europe and how they are a cheap place to stay.
I have gone once before and havenâ€™t done much backpacking there yet but it is amazing.
The hardest part for me is going to Europe and not spend too much money.
I loved all the tips you gave and hopefully can someday go and backpack across the European countryside.

Reply Pallavi May 11 2017 at 646 am Last year I went backpacking in India.
And what an absolutely fantastic time I had there.
I had read an article about backpacking in India which was like a guide to me.
It was fun I was there for a month and covered almost all the major places across the country.
Most of the places especially major cities have a very good connectivity to all parts of the country.
I had pre-booked most of my places and had decided on the itinerary prior to my departure.
I did not wish to carry around a lot of luggage.
Inside the cities I was able to travel easily because of goof transportation system.
Or sometimes if I felt like it I would just rent a bike and roam around the city all night by myself or sometimes even embark on short journeys to nearby places.
One such trip I remember is to this place called Coorg nearby to Mysore.
I took a bike on rent from this company called wwwdotwheelstreetdotcom from Mysore and had visited this place.
It has been one to my trip and this blog has now gotten me excited about a backpacking trip to Europe.
I might as well start planning soon for this.
Reply Hiren P February 25 2019 at 135 pm Make sure Day-wise itinerary as you witness the route.
backpacking to any destination is one of the favorite things to as a any traveler.
when i was backpacking to my most adventures tour as ladakh and now i am packing my bag for Sikkim i am too exciting and imagining that how the place would be and would really adventures as my past trip â€¦ wooh..
