While not always for the better there is no question that it has allowed people to share connect and collaborate in ways that havenâ€™t been possible.
For budget travelers this change has led to a plethora of new money-saving and community-building apps and platforms that have made travel even more affordable and accessible.
Itâ€™s never been easier to connect with locals get off the tourist travel and experience the local pace of life.
To help you save money and connect with locals and travelers alike here are the best sharing economy platforms for travelers.
Hospitality Networks Hospitality networks have been around for decades but they didnâ€™t get popular until the creation of Couchsurfing.
Founded in 2004 this was one of the first sharing economy platforms to change the way people travel.
Couchsurfing connects travelers with locals who are willing to give them a free place to stay couch room floor etc..
In addition to accommodation travelers get a local perspective on a destination.
Itâ€™s meant to be used as a form of cultural exchange and is used by travelers of all ages and families too!.
Couchsrufing popularized hospitality networks and with millions of members all around the world itâ€™s easy to use and find hosts pretty much anywhere.
And if you donâ€™t want to stay with locals you can use the app to meet other locals and travelers for coffee a meal a visit to a museum and other fun activities.
There are always meet-ups posted on the platform including lots of language exchanges and itâ€™s easy to find travel companions on the app as well.
My Community Manager has used it to find road trip companions on a few occasions.
But there is more than just Couchsurfing out there.
Other hospitality exchanges worth checking out are Be Welcome Horizon Global Freeloaders Warm Showers for cyclists Purple Roofs for LGBTQ travelers House and Pet Sitting One of the most recent areas of the sharing economy to see major growth has been house sitting and pet sitting.
As more and more people travel there is a growing demand for house and pet sitters as most people canâ€™t bring their pets or farm animals on a trip with them.
On the other side of the coin more and more travelers are looking to travel slow.
There are also tons of digital nomads out there who need long-term bases to work from as well.
House sitting and pet sitting websites like Trusted Housesitters have done an amazing job at connecting these two demographics.
Much like Airbnb there are profiles ratings and reviews to ensure the platform is safe for everyone involved.
I know bloggers who travel exclusively via house sitting cutting their travel costs by as much as 30% a year! If youâ€™re looking for a unique and fulfilling way to travel slow try pet sitting.
Because who doesnâ€™t want to spend their time with cute animals? Other house and pet sitting webistes you can use are Rover HouseCarers Mind My House Housesit Match Apartment Rentals and Paid Accommodation Hotels are expensive.
Maybe hostels arenâ€™t your thing.
So whatâ€™s the next best choice? Renting someoneâ€™s apartment or a room in it! On apartment sharing/rental websites you can rent a room couch or whole apartment at much cheaper rates than a hotel room.
Plus youâ€™ll have a local host to answer your questions and a kitchen to prepare meals.
Itâ€™s the best middle ground between hostels and hotels.
I think Airbnb offers the most robust inventory for finding a spot in someoneâ€™s house and I prefer them the most.
That said Airbnb is far from perfect.
However itâ€™s important to always compare rental sites because unlike hotel sites where properties appear over multiple websites listings are at the ownerâ€™s discretion and some owners list their property on only one site.
If youâ€™re new to Airbnb get $35 off your first stay! Similar services to Airbnb include Wimdu HomeAway Campspace formerly Camp in my Garden FlipKey Eat With Locals Like apartment sharing there are now meal-sharing sites that connect you with local cooks.
EatWith lets locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that travelers can then sign up for.
You can pick from a variety of meals in each destination with each meal uniquely designed and priced like Airbnb hosts choose their own prices.
Since each cook has their own specialties you can find a ton of variety on this platform.
The dinner parties are intimate insightful and are a unique opportunity to do something different pick a localâ€™s brain and make new friends.
Similar services include Meal Sharing Traveling Spoon With Locals food tours Colunching Taxis In many countries around the world taxis are incedibly expensive.
As a budget traveler you likely avoid taking them as much as possible.
However every now and then we all need one.
Instead of calling a regular taxi use taxi ridesharing apps to save you money.
Lyft is available around the world and is an affordable option of budget travelers.
Uber is the other main option.
Itâ€™s usually a little bit more expensive than Lyft but the cars are nicer and the service a little more professional.
Both options will save you money especially if you use the poolâ€? option to share your ride with other potential customers.
If you choose Uber use code jlx6v to save $15 off your first ride.
Other apps that replace taxis are DiDi Gojek Southeast Asia Gett UK Israel Russia Car Rentals Need a car for a few hours â€” or a few days? Rent someone elseâ€™s! Turo which is available in the US Canada the UK and Germany allows you to rent peopleâ€™s unused cars by the hour or by the day.
Prices are usually cheaper than your traditional rental and youâ€™ll have much more variety too.
Car rental platforms are great for short rentals where a traditional company might be inflexible or overpriced.
Other car rental apps worth checking out are Getaround CarHopper luxury cars in large US cities Drivy RV Share for RVs Trailer Made For trailers and camper vans Rideshares Rideshares are a convenient and cheap way to travel medium and long distances.
Instead of taking the train or a bus you can use ridesharing apps to find locals and travelers who you can for a small fee share a ride with.
Itâ€™s a popular option in Europe and while usually not as cheap as the bus itâ€™s often much faster and more comfortable.
Drivers are vetted and verified and itâ€™s a much better way to get out of stuffy trains and buses meet interesting characters and take a mini-road trip.
Itâ€™s one of my preferred methods of travel.
The biggest player in this space is BlaBlaCar which is huge around Europe and a couple other parts of the world like India Turkey Mexico and Brazil.
If youâ€™re traveling on a budget and want to have a more memorable experience try a rideshare.
It will save you money time and youâ€™ll have a much more interesting experience! Some other good ridesharing companies GoCarma Liftshare based in the UK Gumtree UK/Australia/NZ Kangaride Canada Roadmate NZ Share Your Ride Global Craigslist Volunteering/Work Exchanges If youâ€™re looking to travel long-term but donâ€™t quite have the savings consider a work exchange program.
These usually entail volunteering at a hostel farm school or NGO in exchange for free accommodation and often free food as well.
Positions can last for a couple of days to a couple of months there is tons of variety in the lengths of time as well in the positions available.
You can find opportunities in pretty much every country and city in the world too.
Worldpackers is one of the best platforms to start your search in.
You simply pay to sign up most work exchange websites charge a nominal fee and then youâ€™ll get access to their database.
You can search for opportunities read reviews and contact hosts directly to plan your next exchange.
If youâ€™re on a budget and want to extend your travels this is one of the best ways to boost your time abroad.
Other great work exchange resources are Helpx Workaway WWOOF *** The rise of the sharing economyâ€? has made it so much easier for travelers around the world to connect with each other â€” and save money in the process! But more than just saving money these platforms allow better access to destinations promote new interactions offer unique opportunities and create nuanced and intimate travel experience.
On your next trip be sure to give the sharing economy a try.
Youâ€™ll learn much more about the culture and destination save money and have a much more memorable experience.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.
My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are World Nomads for everyone below 70 Insure My Trip for those over 70 Looking for the best companies to save money with?

Both great dinners and a good way to make new friends.
It has become a new favorite of mine.
You might have to host in NYC Matt! Reply rebecca February 18 2014 at 229 pm thanks for the great links and resources.
So many of these I didnâ€™t know of Reply Dave Briggs February 18 2014 at 340 pm Hospitality networks have been a great development.
I would just like to mention Warmshowers which is a cyclist hospitality network proving useful for thousands of bicycle tourers all around the world.
Reply Saul February 18 2014 at 513 pm Great article! Iâ€™ve been using many of these sites for a while now.
Hadnâ€™t heard of Camp in My Garden though which sounds awesome! Over the past few years Iâ€™ve pieced together a living as an Airbnb host TaskRabbit and DogVacay sitter while also renting out my car on RelayRides.
Lots of opportunities here! Reply Paul February 18 2014 at 725 pm Hey Matt Great article with a ton of resources.
While going through it I noticed you missed out on BlaBlaCar an excellent resource used in Europe for sharing rides with drivers.
Itâ€™s much more economical than booking a last-minute train.
Reply Catherine February 19 2014 at 427 am Had only heard of Couchsurfing and Airbnb before didnâ€™t realise there were so many other great resources out there! Thank you very much for sharing going to get these added to my favourites right away â€“ EatWith in particular sounds like such a great idea! Reply Rachel February 19 2014 at 741 am I have heard of these before but itâ€™s nice to see them in one post I can bookmark ð?™‚ Sadly so many of these I canâ€™t use in India.
For example I LOVE couchsurfing but have kind of quit it lately here.
Iâ€™ve also wanted to try InterNations.
Reply Parul February 19 2014 at 1151 am Hey Rachel You can actually use a lot of these in India.
If you are in Hyderabad do give me a shoutout plus Iâ€™ll treat you to a home cooked meal You can look me up in mealsharing.
Matt Thanks a lot coz I was looking to start a home restaurant and this is like the perfect time and post.
Parul Reply David February 19 2014 at 1234 pm Great List Matt.
I am a big fan of collaborative consumption.
Iâ€™ve used several services from your list.
And learned about a few new ones which I will soon try outâ€¦ We at HitTheRoad.ca like to think of ourselves as part of the sharing economy too.
Carsharing meets road trip.
It was my experience in the sharing economy that got me thinking about new venues.
David Reply Cyra February 19 2014 at 237 pm Wow there is some great information in this post.
I was aware of quite a few of them but Vayable is a new one to me.
I am going to have to check that out.
I actually booked my first Eat With dinner the other day itâ€™s for next week so I havenâ€™t tried it out yet.
But I will be in a city on my own so I decided it would be a good opportunity to try something new! Incidently this same city i will be staying in a room from Airbnb.
19 euros for a private room instead of the 30-40 euros that hostels were charging for a bed in a dorm! I do love Airbnb.
Reply Paul February 20 2014 at 452 am Matt just want to say thank you for posting these awesome options for budget travel.
These tips could make an enormous difference in my ability to travel long term.
Thank you!!! Reply Victoria February 21 2014 at 129 am Thanks for this post Matt.
As Iâ€™m from Britain although I live in Germany LOL I have heard of some of these websites however Eat With Localsâ€? and Get a Personal Tour Guideâ€? sounds great and something that I could look into in the next few months.
Reply Michael Matti February 21 2014 at 341 pm Good to know as I plan a two month trip to Europe for this spring.
I was planning on using couch surfing and AirBnB but now may have to look at some of these other sites too.
Reply Joel Stephenson February 22 2014 at 303 pm Great advice! Couch Surfing is pretty amazing.
Wherever you go even my small village in England there seems to be somebody willing to host you.
Workaway.info is pretty amazing too if you are willing to work for your accommodation and food.
Reply Frank February 24 2014 at 342 am This goes well beyond the usual Couchsurfing Craigslist  etc recommendations in posts like this â€¦ Eatwith sounds AWESOME and while Iâ€™ve known about AirBnB for a while now Iâ€™ll be using it when I get back to Canada for sure! Reply Rashad Pharaon February 26 2014 at 404 am Wow I definitely hadnâ€™t heard of a LOT of these websites â€“ thank you! Camping your way around Western Europe seems like a really fresh way to do the well-worn circuit.
I also had a friend who cycled Europe and used CouchSurfing the entire time â€“ she only paid for a hostel 2x in 3 months! Reply Aaron May 8 2015 at 949 pm Thanks Matt this article helped shed some light on these websites I knew nothing about.
Upwork is also a great sharing economy websiteâ€? If you have a digital project like website or app instead of getting a company to do it why not hire a freelancer instead! They are much cheaper and you donâ€™t have to pay the other run off costs associated with a company.
Also good if you are a freelancer as you can travel and work! Reply Matt January 25 2016 at 831 pm Good list â€“ glad to be able to check out some alternatives to airbnb which I think has become much too commercial and rates are equal to or in some cases higher than hotels.
Will be giving couch surfing a go later this year but note with interest they have now introduced a fee option as well for hosts Reply James McKenzie March 2 2016 at 446 am Recommend house sitting especially thereâ€™s a site called Trustedhousesesitters which is helping us travel all over the world and stay in really great places for free looking after pets.
You get to meet the owners and their friends and enjoy living like a local in cool communities.
Definitely money saving.
Good for spontaneous travel too.
Reply Kendal January 6 2020 at 1242 pm Hey Matt & readers I wanted to add two things to this great post! The app Yandex Taxiâ€? is actually the best taxi app to use in Russian as well as in Belarus.
Itâ€™s mega cheap for a taxi service and works just like Uber.
Additionally BlaBlaCar is often better to use than the buses/marschrutkas in Ukraine! So for anyone going to Ukraine check out BlaBlaCar.
A lot of people will start their own shuttleâ€? service using this app.
