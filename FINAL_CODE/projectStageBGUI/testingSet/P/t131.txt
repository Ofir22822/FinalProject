Itâ€™s a city that Iâ€™ve been to many times.
Once a major city in the Roman Empire the city still places an important role in the region and is home to millions of residents and visitors enjoying all the delicious sangria and gin mouthwatering food stunning beaches warm weather the rich history and culture and unique architecture that Barcelona is famous for.
Barcelona is one of the most vibrant fun energetic cities in the world.
Barcelona is such a popular place that in recent years itâ€™s even had to clamp down on overtourismâ€? to help reduce the number of visitors.
This is something I fully agree with since cities must learn to balance tourism with local life.
With so much to see and do in and around Barcelona where do you begin? How many days do you need to visit? I think to really get a feel for Barcelona you should plan for four or five days.
While you could see it in less youâ€™ll do yourself a disservice if you rush your visit.
This is a city of late-night dinners late morning and afternoon siestas.
Life isnâ€™t rushed here and neither should your visit.
This 2-5 day itinerary highlights all the best things to see and do and help you organize your visit so you can see it all! Table of Contents Day 1 Barri Gotic Park GÃ¼ell Barcelona History Museum & more! Day 2 Picasso Museum La BoquerÃ­a La Rambla & more! Day 3 MontjuÃ¯c Hill Cooking Class Harbor Cable Car & more! Day 4 Day Trip to Girona Other Things to See and Do Montserrat Gaudi Bike Tour & more! Barcelona Itinerary Day 1 Take a free walking tour I love free walking tours.
I think they are a wonderful way to get to know a new city find your way around and learn some history in the process.
And since they are filled with traveler too they can also be a good way to meet other people.
My recommended walking tour companies in Barcelona are Sandemanâ€™s Free Walking Tours Barcelona Free Tours By Foot Get lost in the Barri Gotic Barcelonaâ€™s old Gothic Quarter is my favorite part of town filled with narrow winding streets and historic buildings.
Spend a few hours getting lost in this district.
To me itâ€™s the most beautiful area in the city.
The area also has numerous attractions worth seeing Barcelona History Museum â€“ Barcelona has one of the best city history museums Iâ€™ve ever visited including 4000 square meters of Roman ruins beneath the museum that you can walk through.
There is a free detailed audio guide and meticulous explanations of the exhibits.
If you do one thing in the city make it this.
I visit every time Iâ€™m in Barcelona.
The ruins are just stunning.
Admission is â‚¬7.
Address PlaÃ§a del Rei.
The Grand Royal Palace â€“ The Palau Reial Major near the history museum was the home of Barcelonaâ€™s counts and later the kings of Aragon.
It has a very detailed history about the city and region through the centuries.

Free on the first Sunday of the month and every Sunday after 3pm.
Address PlaÃ§a del Rei.
Chapel of Santa Ã€gata â€“ This royal chapel was built in 1302.

Admission is â‚¬7 though you can sometimes get in for free thereâ€™s no apparent schedule to this.
Address Placita de la Seu 3.
Explore GaudÃ­â€™s architecture GaudÃ­ is Barcelonaâ€™s most famous and creative architect.
His unique style use of nature motifs and catalog of work is legendary â€“ and part of the reason so many people visit the city.
No visit to the city is complete without a tour of GaudÃ­â€™s works.
You can find them everywhere â€” in addition to the buildings listed below he even designed lampposts monuments and sculptures.
Here are the best sights to see Park GÃ¼ell â€“ Park GÃ¼ell is a 45-acre garden complex designed and built between 1900 to 1914.
Itâ€™s since been converted into a municipal garden and is now a World Heritage Site.
The focal point of the park is the main terrace which is surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent.
Known for incorporating various themes into his work GaudÃ­ incorporated artistic elements of Catalan nationalism as well as ancient poetry and mysticism into this work.
The park is right near La Sagrada Familia so itâ€™s easy to visit both.
I like how colorful everything in the park is! Tickets are â‚¬8.50 at the ticket office or â‚¬7.50 when you order in advance online.
Children six years old and younger are free.
Address Carrer dâ€™Olot.
La Sagrada FamÃ­lia â€“ The most famous of GaudÃ­â€™s workâ€¦.and one that seems to never be finished.
The church has been under construction for over than 100 years the groundbreaking was in 1882 and is supposed to be done in 2030!.
GaudÃ­ was a devout Catholic and spent the last 10 years of his life working on this project.
The church blends influences of man nature and religion in its detailed architecture.
The audio guide is worth purchasing as it covers the history of the church in great detail.
Try to visit mid-morning to late afternoon so you can witness the sunlight cascade throughout all the stained glass.
Admission is â‚¬15 online/â‚¬18 at the door.
Address PlaÃ§a de la Sagrada Familia.
Casa BatllÃ³ â€“ Casa Batllo is a building restored by Antoni GaudÃ­ in the early 1900s.
He spent 2 years on the project completely revamping the exterior main floor patio and roof.
With its undulating shape itâ€™s definitely one of the more eye-catching of his creations.
Located in the Eixample district of Barcelona it like everything GaudÃ­ designed was heavy influenced by the Art Nouveau style.
The facade was decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles that he collected from the trash of a nearby glass shop.
The roof is arched and has been likened to the back of a dragon.
Itâ€™s one of my favorite GaudÃ­ buildings.
Admission is â‚¬24.50 online/â‚¬28.50 at door.
Address Passeig de GrÃ cia 43.
Casa MilÃ  also called La Pedrera â€“ From 1906 to 1910 Gaudi work on Casa Mila also known as La Pedreraâ€? the stone quarry as the building has a facade of limestone.
The goal was to evoke the sense of a snowy mountain.
GaudÃ­ himself a Catholic and a devotee of the Virgin Mary also planned for the Casa MilÃ  to be a spiritual symbol and included many religious elements like an excerpt from the rosary prayer on the cornice and statues of Mary St.
Michael and St.
Gabriel.
Casa MilÃ  became run down and partially abandoned until it was restored in the late 1980s to its original form.
Admission is â‚¬22 online/â‚¬25 at door.
Address Passeig de GrÃ cia 92.
Palau GÃ¼ell â€“ Located off La Rambla Palau Guell Guell Palace building doesnâ€™t jump out at you like other GaudÃ­ structures.
Built from 1886-88 it was designed for one of Gaudiâ€™s patrons Eusebi GÃ¼ell.
The home is centered around the main room used to entertain high-society guests.
The main party room has a high ceiling with small holes near the top where lanterns were hung at night from the outside to give the appearance of a starlit sky.
There are colorful tree-like chimneys on top.
Itâ€™s a bit creepy and gothic to me.
One of my favorites too! Admission is â‚¬12 free on the first Sunday of every month.
Address Carrer Nou de la Rambla 3-5.
Note Advanced reservations are recommended for Park Guell Sagrada Familia Casa Mila and Casa Batllo so you can skip the lines! Barcelona Itinerary Day 2 Visit the Picasso Museum While Iâ€™m not a huge fan of most of Picassoâ€™s later work itâ€™s still interesting to learn about the life and work of one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century.

Address PlaÃ§a dels Ã€ngels 1.
La BoquerÃ­a This public market has an amazing array of food stalls and restaurants.
Itâ€™s been at this location for hundreds of years in a building with a beautiful iron entrance.
Itâ€™s right off La Rambla a long popular central thoroughfare see below so the market is typically very busy.
But grab a snack or an inexpensive lunch of ham bread cheese and fruit and enjoy the scene.
Thereâ€™s a wide variety of seafood including fish shrimp octopus and oysters as well as nuts candy wine and tapas.
NOTE Due to overcrowding tourist groups are now restricted to 15 people or less.
Youâ€™ll have no problem moving about on your own but if youâ€™re in a large groupâ€¦.well be prepared to get kicked out! The city is appropriately trying to take back the markets for locals.
Watch for changes to how they allow tourists into the market.
Take a stroll on La Rambla The popular 1.2km long boulevard with a broad but crowded walkway in the center has many beautiful buildings along it including the Gran Teatre del Liceu the cityâ€™s opera house.
Near the theater you can also see a mosaic by Joan MirÃ³.
And there are street performers galore here they even have their own union.
While this street is ground zero for tourists in the city donâ€™t eat at the restaurants here they suck itâ€™s worth a stroll down at least once.
Hit the beach Youâ€™ve done a ton of walking so far so take the afternoon to relax! Barcelona has a wide and long beach Barceloneta that is incredibly popular year-round.
The water is good to swim in the sand is golden colored and there are a lot of good restaurants on the boardwalk.
Itâ€™s always busy with tourists and locals however so walk further from the center to reach some quieter and cleaner beaches such as Sant SebastiÃ  in the south and Somorrostro in the north.
Watch some flamenco Spend your evening watching flamenco at one of these places Los Tarantos â€“ This is Barcelonaâ€™s oldest flamenco venue.

Barcelona Itinerary Day 4 Take a day trip to Girona This medieval city just 100km from Barcelona is one of my favorite destinations in Spain â€“ and far too overlooked by travelers.
Here you can climb atop the city walls wander the narrow lanes of the Jewish Quarter and soak up the ambiance at one of its many cafÃ©s.
They filmed Game of Thrones here too! Thereâ€™s a lot of history and delicious food in the city! The Renfe train ride is about 80 minutes on the normal train return tickets from â‚¬20 the high-speed train gets there in 38 minutes return tickets from â‚¬30.

Once there pay a visit to the famous shrine of the Black Madonna at the monastery and walk around the park.

Screenings take place on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and are preceded by some cool live music.
Watch a soccer match â€“ The first footballâ€? game I ever saw was in Barcelona.
It was Espanyol versus Valencia.
I still have the shirt I bought that day.
Barcelonaâ€™s two teams are Espanyol and FC Barcelona and if a match is going on try to take in one.
