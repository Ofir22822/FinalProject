Environmentally friendly travel is now one of the fastest-growing movements in the industry and I for one welcome this trend.
Itâ€™s an incredibly important topic that Iâ€™ve been writing about for years.
After all why destroy what you love? No one wants to see paradise paved over.
We all cringe when we return to an overdeveloped polluted destination.
None of us want to contribute to that.
Being an eco-friendly traveler is simply being a respectful traveler.
As we strive to become more environmentally conscious the questions for travelers become Just how do we greenâ€? our travels? What can we do to lower our carbon footprint as we travel the world? How can we better interact with the communities we visit? What changes can we make that are actually helpful? Flight shaming people is not the answer but do we all just stay home and quit traveling? Fortunately thereâ€™s actually a lot we can do as travelers to reduce our ecological footprint while contributing to the sustainability of the communities we visit.
Here are 13 concrete ways to reduce your environmental impact as a traveler 1.
Stay Close to Home Though the exotic is always appealing travel doesnâ€™t have to be about going somewhere far away.
Travel is the art of exploration and discovery â€” and that can just as well be nearby.
Find somewhere close to home you havenâ€™t been get in your car or better yet take the bus and go visit.
You never know what youâ€™ll come across! Xâ€? is always the most interesting place on the map.
2.
Make Greener Transportation Choices If you can try to travel by train or bus.
Not only does this reduce your carbon footprint but companies like FlixBus Megabus and Greyhound always have some cheap tickets so you can save money too.
And when traveling by car consider offering rides to other travelers to lower your collective emissions and cut costs.
Many people will be happy to chip in for gas if it saves them time which means you can save money and lower your carbon footprint at the same time.
Win-win! That will cut your per-person transportation emissions in half if not more.
Use platforms like BlaBlaCar Couchsurfing and Craigslist to find rideshares near you.
Avoid flying or driving long distances by yourself whenever you can.
3.
Travel Slow When we travel abroad we have a tendency to rush around from place to place trying to soak in as many sights as possible.
I get that.
After all not everyone can be permanent nomads and when you have limited time and arenâ€™t sure if youâ€™re coming back again I can see why people travel fast.â€? However not only does this raise your transportation costs since youâ€™re moving a lot you end up increasing your carbon footprint.
All those trains buses and planes add up.
The fewer you take the better.
Additionally being a good traveler not only means reducing your carbon footprint but also doing good by the communities you visit.
Day-tripping brings in very little money to communities but impacts their infrastructure heavily itâ€™s why the city of Hallstatt in Austria is restricting day tours.
So try to stay at a destination for a least a night.
Traveling to fewer destinations is good not only for your wallet and the climate itâ€™s good for local communities as well.
Plus slowing your travels will let you get to know places in a deeper way since youâ€™ll get to spend more time there.
In travel less can be more.
4.
Pack Smart While the specifics of will depend on where youâ€™re going there are a few things youâ€™ll want to bring with you to help you travel more sustainably Reusable water bottle â€“ Nalgene makes durable bottles that are BPA-free and made in the USA.
Water filter â€“ Many destinations donâ€™t have potable water which means youâ€™re going to be using tons of single-use plastic.
Instead bring a Lifestraw or SteriPen.
These devices will purify your water so you can drink from practically anywhere ensuring you can avoid single-use plastic bottles.
Tote bag/stuff sack â€“ If youâ€™re traveling long-term bring a tote back or an extra stuff sack.
You can use them for buying groceries and avoid plastic bags.
At other times they can be used to keep your bag organized.
Diva cup â€“ This is a reusable menstrual cup.
While I canâ€™t speak from personal experience itâ€™s something our resident solo female travel expert packs when she travels since menstrual products are not always available and can also be quite wasteful.
Utensils â€“ Travel cutlery a fork knife and spoon or just a spork or a set of chopsticks can come in handy if youâ€™re on a budget and plan on cooking your own meals.
But theyâ€™re also useful for street food and eating out as you can avoid plastic cutlery.
Additionally bring a small Tupperware container for leftovers.
I always find myself with extra food when I cook in hostels.
This helps avoid waste and provides food for the next day.
Itâ€™s an amazing travel hack surprisingly few people make use of.
5.
Fly with Fewer Connections While I donâ€™t believe in flight shaming itâ€™s impossible to deny that flying does have a hefty carbon impact.
In addition to limiting your flying try to use longer flights with fewer connections.
Twenty-five percent of airplane emissions occur during takeoff and landing which means if you fly shorter flights with more connections your emissions will be drastically higher.
Flying direct is simply the better option environmentally so opt for that whenever possible.
6.
Avoid Overvisited Destinations If you can avoid cities grappling with overtourism.
Youâ€™ll find fewer crowds and lower prices and you also wonâ€™t be putting as much strain on local communities struggling to keep up.
And from a sheer personal-enjoyment point of view who wants to deal with crowds or long lines? No one.
If you do visit overtouristed places such as Venice Amsterdam or Barcelona pick a hotel or hostel instead of using sites like Airbnb.
Apartment rentals drive up rents for locals and force them out of the city center.
Unless youâ€™re going to share accommodation with a local by renting a room from them or using Couchsurfing stick to hotels and hostels.
Airbnb and similar sites really are detrimental to cities that donâ€™t have a lot of housing.
7.
Take Public Transportation After walking public transportation is the next best way to explore new destinations.
On arrival head to the local tourism office to learn about the options as well as any visitor discounts available for public transit.
If you do need a taxi use ridesharing apps instead.
Uber and Lyft have a poolâ€? option in many cities which lets you split your ride with other travelers.
While it may take a little longer to get to your destination it will save you money and ensure that your ride is as eco-friendly as possible.
When it comes to longer distances budget buses are your best way of getting around since they usually pack in a lot of passengers.
Megabus and FlixBus are two of the most popular options.
8.
Eat Local Food that is imported has a much higher carbon footprint than locally grown food and itâ€™s usually not as fresh either.
To keep your carbon footprint down eat like a local.
Stick to foods that are grown locally and avoid packaged and imported foods much as possible.
This will ensure that youâ€™re eating seasonal produce which not only is going to be the freshest but will also support the local economy.
Also stick to organic food if you can.
Sure the odd Western comfort meal is not the end of the world but the more you eat locally the more you reduce your environmental footprint and the more you help the local economy as well.
After all you didnâ€™t come to Thailand to eat a burger you could get at home right? 9.
Cut Back on Meat and Dairy Iâ€™m not saying you need to go vegan.
I love meat and never plan to give up bacon.
But if youâ€™re concerned with the impact of your food reducing your meat and dairy intake is extremely helpful.
Over 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food â€” and the majority of those emissions are from animal products.
So by cutting back on your meat and dairy consumption youâ€™ll drastically reduce your carbon footprint.
Avoid Brazilian beef if you can as lot comes from cleared rainforest land.
Cattle ranching is the #1 cause of rainforest deforestation in the world.
Same for soy too.
Plus itâ€™s never been easier to travel as a vegan or vegetarian as there are tons of amazing restaurants out there â€” as well as apps to help you find them you can download the HappyCow app to find the best vegan and vegetarian options near you.
Even if you take meat and dairy out of one meal a week youâ€™ll be moving the needle in favor of a lower carbon footprint and a more ethical diet.
10.
Avoid Animal Attractions Part of traveling green is helping the other creatures that inhabit his earth.
That means you should avoid any and all attractions that use captive wild animals for entertainment.
The most common offenders are riding elephants swimming with dolphins visiting captive whales and petting drugged tigers.
These activities require animal abuse and imprisonment and should be avoided.
Animals are best viewed in their natural habitats.
If you want to see them go on a safari jungle hike or whale-watching tour and see the animals where they belong in the wild.
If you want to be an ethical and responsible traveler stick to taking photographs and avoid direct interactions with animals.
For more information on animal tourism and how to avoid it check out these helpful organizations World Animal Protection Wildlife Watch 11.
Reduce Your Plastic Use I hate plastic.
It creates a ton of waste.
From plastic bottles to toothpaste tubes to shopping bags plastic sucks.
I admit Iâ€™m not perfect and I still use too much but Iâ€™m always trying to reduce my consumption both at home and abroad.
Avoiding plastic as much as possible is a great way to reduce your environmental impact.
You can buy a reusable water bottle use toothpaste tabs carry your own cutlery and travel with a canvas bag for starters.
Additionally skip the plastic straws and cutlery and avoid getting take-out unless it comes in biodegradable containers.
Straws can take 200 years to biodegrade and plastic bags take 20.
Donâ€™t let a few minutes of convenience endanger the planet.
Skip the plastic.
12.
Cut Back on Cruises Cruises are one of the worst offenders when it comes to carbon footprints and overtourism.
Taking a cruise has the same average per-person carbon footprint as flying from London to Tokyo â€” round-trip.
Thatâ€™s almost 20000 kilometers 12500 miles! Thanks to cruises carbon emissions in popular port cities can be so high that thousands of people actually die prematurely every year.
And to top it all off day-trippers from cruises visits are overwhelming local economies driving up prices forcing out locals and creating destinations that are over-reliant on tourism.
Donâ€™t get me wrong cruises are a fun way to travel.
But if youâ€™re looking to lower your environmental footprint youâ€™ll want to avoid cruises as much as possible.
13.
Take a Nature-Related Trip Travel is one of the best personal development tools there is.
It opens you up to a whole new world and widens your perspective of so many things â€” people culture history food and so much more.
If you want to better understand and appreciate the natural world try taking a trip with the sole purpose of connecting with nature.
Head to the Australian Outback go diving and swim around coral reefs visit national parks camp in the Moroccan desert stay a few weeks in a town with little or no electricity canoe down the Amazon River or spend a few nights under the stars in a field close to home.
Do something that gets you in touch with the world in a way that sitting at home with all the electricity and free-flowing running water doesnâ€™t.
I promise that when you come home youâ€™ll have a new perspective on why weâ€™re all so focused on being environmentally friendly these days.
It doesnâ€™t take much to see that we are living unsustainably and somethingâ€™s got to give.
Going on a nature adventure can get you to think differently when it comes to the environment and how important it is for us to treat it well.
*** Traveling in a more green and eco-friendly way is something we should all aspire to.
As travelers itâ€™s our responsibility to make sure that while we explore the globe we do so in a way that doesnâ€™t harm the planet or the local communities that we visit.
With a few simple changes you can all become better and more sustainable travelers.
You just need to take that first step.
Action begets action and the more actions you take the easier the other ones will be.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels.
I use them all the time.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.

Sailboat charters can be an excellent way to keep carbon output levels in check.
Where there is a will thereâ€™s a way! Reply Renuka February 17 2020 at 1101 pm I was about to write a post on the same topic! Over-tourism is one of the issues that has been pinching me as a traveler for a while now.
Most of the points that you mentioned here are with me already.
The only part I didnâ€™t know was that cruises add to carbon emission.
Thankfully I havenâ€™t taken any cruise as such in my life.
Thank you for writing this post! Itâ€™s the pressing need of the hour.
Reply Becky February 18 2020 at 802 pm Love this! Thanks for encouraging people to travel more sustainably.
Iâ€™d also add ditch the souvenirsâ€?.
Of course itâ€™s fun to pick up meaningful mementos but SO many souvenirs just end up in the trash.
If you want to buy things for friends and relatives choose useful souvenirs like cooking ingredients or local art.
Reply Allison Corbett February 20 2020 at 1126 am Thanks for including eating veg*n as one of the options to cut greenhouse emissions while traveling â€“ and also when you return home! Reply M February 20 2020 at 207 pm I really appreciate the intent of this post but this is a bit incongruous.
Itâ€™s advice in a post written by someone who isnâ€™t living in Asia who is writing from Asia even though the first point of advice is to stay close to home and then the next is to avoid flying by using ground transport and then after that to avoid ground transport because itâ€™s wasteful and you should go slower.
Moreover to make an indictment about cruises being equivalent to a round trip from Tokyo to London while announcing a personal itinerary that includes a â€˜cheap flight toâ€™ Taiwan two destinations in Europe and then a trip back home does not come across asâ€¦ Integrous.
I agree with these principles but there needs to be someâ€¦ Consistency checking and maybe some more research to back up such guidances? For instance why is ride sharing necessarily better for a local economy over a taxi? Eating locally grown foods can be argued to be more wasteful than concentrating food production in areas with more productive food growing environments etc.
donâ€™t jump me for this I know itâ€™s very nuanced and controversial!.
Just..
Sharing this b/c the topic is important but the content could be improved to be more helpful to the cause I think.
=/ Reply Paul Andrade February 21 2020 at 623 pm I will never take Greyhound again unless I have no other choice.
My bag dissapered after an employee assured me he would put it on the correct bus.
Greyhound policies made it impossible for titrack it or receive compensation.
Doing some research I found that their lawyers had a hand in creating the regulations otheyâ€™re subject to and there are many thousands of similar complaints of similar stories about Greyhound posted on .the internet.
I believe my bag was not lost but stolen by employees.
Beware Reply Adam LaPlante February 24 2020 at 447 pm Itâ€™s hard to wrap heads around the idea that travel isnâ€™t exactly sustainable.
But as someone who also travels quite often I have actual begun to see more and more change in terms of sustainability and travel.
You start to notice more reusable water bottles in peoplesâ€™ packs and more places for the users to fill up! I was super excited to see a bottle fill station for my first time in an airport a few years back.
And better yet the US national parks I can not speak for other countries have been on top of the game for sustainable travel.
For as long as I could remember they have have had water fill stations free public transportation throughout the park and even gone as far as replacing bathroom amenities with zero-water ones! I like the ideas youâ€™ve brought forward and will totally be incorporating some of them myself as I continue to make travel my lifestyle! Reply Rebecca February 26 2020 at 525 am Traveling light not demanding everything which you are used to in your home country and using eco-friendly transportation is always my top priorities.
Few of my fellow first-time travelers keeps comparing the new country with their own which is somewhat natural.
But my advise is not to find what youâ€™ve already seen instead explore and differences with an open mind.
Sad to say but going vegan is not my thing ð?™‚ Reply Cynthia Morris February 29 2020 at 339 pm Great article.
Lots to think about and act upon.
Re #7 I love accessing local bike share systems.
Itâ€™s a great inexpensive way to get around.
You see much more from a bike and learn how the local traffic patterns flow.
Also of course itâ€™s great to get exercise while getting around.
Makes it easier to eat more local food! Reply Hamim March 14 2020 at 1008 am Good article Matt! I think all of us can participate and prosper sustainable travel.
I am working on sustainable travel concepts in the Middle East.
There are many places to visit in Middle East but the sustainable concept still missing there.
I hope everyone understand the situation.
