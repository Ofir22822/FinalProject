But that doesnâ€™t mean a trip there has to break the bank.
There are plenty of ways to save money during your visit to Iceland including during your stay in the cozy capital city of Reykjavik.
Home to just 125000 people Reykjavik is a small city that is bustling with life and activities all year round.
Itâ€™s artsy cute fun and just filled with an awesome energy! Whether youâ€™re visiting Reykjavik on a weekend city break or planning to head out and explore the entire country there are plenty of ways to save money during your stint in the city! To help you do that here are my favorite free or cheap things to do in and around Icelandâ€™s awesome capital Free Things to Do in Reykjavik 1.
Take a Free Walking Tour One of the best ways to start a trip to a new city is to take a walking tour.
Youâ€™ll get to see the main sights learn some history and acclimatize to the culture.
Plus you have a local expert who you can ask questions to which is an invaluable resource in and of itself! The two companies I recommend are The City Walk and Free Walking Tours Reykjavik.
You canâ€™t go wrong with either.
Remember to tip your guide! 2.
Enjoy the Local Entertainment Since the harsh climate forces many Icelanders to be indoors much of the year theyâ€™ve developed a creative and artistic culture.
There are lots of Icelandic painters poets writers and musicians.
You can usually catch a free live show in ReykjavÃ­k at CafÃ© Rosenberg sometimes thereâ€™s a cover charge at the door Hlemmur Square Hostel usually on Wednesday nights KEX Hostel HI Loft Hostel and the Drunk Rabbit Irish Pub which usually has someone who sings solo with his guitar.
3.
Find Free Hot Springs While the Blue Lagoon may be the most popular hot spring in the area there are tons of others around the country that are free or at the very least less money than the Blue Lagoon.
Visit the website Hotpot Iceland to find the best hot springs near the city.
One nearby hot spring worth visiting is in Reykjadalur.
Itâ€™s around a 40-minute drive from town and involves a bit of a hike to get there about 30 minutes but itâ€™s much more secluded â€“ and much less expensive â€“ than the Blue Lagoon! 4.
Hang out with the Locals Iceland has a very active Couchsurfing community.
Iâ€™ve stayed with hosts in ReykjavÃ­k as well as in Akureyri Icelandâ€™s main northern city.
While many hosts are expats living in Iceland itâ€™s still a great way to save some money and get helpful local insights! Additionally if you donâ€™t want to stay with a stranger there are usually weekly meet-ups you can attend! Make some friends! 5.
Hit the Beach NauthÃ³lsvÃ­k is a man-made beach that not only has hot tubs but also a heated swimming area! Itâ€™s popular with locals and gets quite busy in the summer so make sure to come early to get a good spot.
There is also a non-heated swimming area so if youâ€™re feeling brave you can test the waters spoiler itâ€™s cold.
6.
Hike Mount Esja If youâ€™re looking to stretch your legs head up Esja.
The summit sits around 900m above sea level offering you some amazing views of the city and surrounding area.
Located just 10km from the city the hike will take a couple of hours but the views are definitely worth it! Just make sure you check the weather as itâ€™s unwise to hike during rain or snow.
7.
Visit the Harpa Music Hall & Conference Center Opened in 2011 this cultural and social center is worth checking out just to see the architecture for yourself.
You can also catch the Iceland Symphony Orchestra Reykjavik Big Band and the Icelandic Opera here.
The venue also hosts tons of other shows and performances as well so check their website for an up-to-date schedule performances will have a fee.
Austurbakki 2 +354 528 5000 en.harpa.is.

8.
See ReykjavÃ­kâ€™s Botanical Gardens The city operates this beautifully-designed botanical garden that is home to over 5000 plant species.
Youâ€™ll also see ponds birdlife and beautiful flora dotting the small garden.
Thereâ€™s also a cafÃ© nearby thatâ€™s open in the summer that features dishes made with herbs and spices grown on-site in the garden.
Laugardalur 104 ReykjavÃ­k +354 411 8650 grasagardur.is.
Open daily from 10am-3pm 10pm in the summer.

Visit the GrÃ³tta Lighthouse This lighthouse sits at the edge of the city and is a wonderful place to bird watch and gaze out at the stretching Atlantic ocean.
It â€™s a long walk along the coast from the city center but the scenic view and gorgeous coastal walk are definitely worth it.
If youâ€™re visiting in the winter months this is also a great place to see the northern lights! 10.
Walk or Bike the Coast ReykjavÃ­k is a small city and its coastline is walkable or bikeable if you want to rent one.
Some great stops along the way are the NauthÃ³lsvÃ­k Geothermal Beach and the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula.
If youâ€™re not interested in biking around by yourself feel free to take a bike tour instead.
Iceland Bike is the best bike tour company for this! 11.
Visit Perlan This is a dome-shaped building called The Pearlâ€? and it offers another great place to get a view of the city and surrounding area! On clear days you can see as far as SnÃ¦fellsjÃ¶kull the 700000-year-old glacier-capped volcano that sits on the western coast of the island.
Inside the dome there is a cocktail bar and restaurant so it makes for a nice place to go out and enjoy the view.
12.
See the Sun Voyager This iconic statue sits known as SÃ³lfar in Icelandic was built in 1990 by Icelandic sculptor JÃ³n Gunnar Ã?rnason.
Itâ€™s his interpretation of discovery using the design of a traditional Viking ship to represent the promise of discovering new territory and the freedom that comes with traveling to new worlds.
13.
Experience the Northern Lights If youâ€™re visiting Reykjavik between October and March youâ€™ll have a good chance of seeing the Aurora on a clear night.
Youâ€™ll want to get away from the city a bit to have the best view as the light pollution will make it hard to see.
Cheap Things to Do in Reykjavik 14.
Take in the View from HallgrÃ­mskirkja This church is one of the most memorable that Iâ€™ve seen.
The stark concrete faÃ§ade was designed to mimic the Icelandic landscape which I think it does quite well.
It was named after the 17th-century clergyman and Icelandic poet HallgrÃ­mur PÃ©tursson who wrote the Hymns of the Passion.
Itâ€™s the tallest building in ReykjavÃ­k and for a small fee you can go up to the top to get incredible shots of the city and its multicolored rooftops.

The Icelandic Phallological Museum This is one of the weirdest museums youâ€™ll ever have a chance to go to â€“ which s partly why you should go! Entirely not sexual the museum has collected penises from varies species roaming the earth land and sea.
The founder an Icelandic historian named Sigurdur Hjartarson started the penis museum as a joke but itâ€™s become something much more.
The whole museum is pretty small so you wonâ€™t need more than 30-60 minutes but itâ€™s pretty interesting and informative youâ€™ll actually learn a lot about how species procreate in addition to seeing a lot ofâ€¦well exhibits.
