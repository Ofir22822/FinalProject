He had just returned from an overland drive from New York City to Patagonia.
After I peppered him with questions about his trip I mean really how cool does that trip sound? he asked me one How do you deal with coming home staying in the travel mindset and keeping the lessons you learned alive?â€? Itâ€™s a great question and it touches on something a lot of travelers get blindsided by the post-travel blues.
Post-trip depression is something many long-term travelers struggle with.
Coming home is often harder than leaving or adjusting to life abroad because itâ€™s so anticlimactic.
Before your trip there is this massive buildup of emotions preparation and excitement.
Youâ€™ve been planning your trip for months imagining yourself trekking through foreign lands meeting interesting people and going on an adventure.
Youâ€™re moving toward a goal.
Youâ€™re excited.
A bright future of possibility lies before you.
But then you come home after months or years abroad and itâ€™s suddenly now what?â€? Thereâ€™s no more buildup.
Just a complete stop.
You donâ€™t come back with a bang you come back with a whimper.
Your friends are only kind of interested in your trip but soon their eyes glaze over at your travel tales.
Before you know it you fall back into your old routine and itâ€™s as if the trip never happened.
So what can you do to re-create that sense of travel when you get back home? And given the times we live in what do you do when you are quarantined because of coronavirus flights are grounded and the travel industry has come to a halt? How can you keep that sense of adventure alive while you are home literally in your home and generally in your community? Well here are 7 ways to bring the world to you when you canâ€™t go to it 1.
Read travel books The easiest thing you can do to bring the world to you is to visit it through a book.
Read about peopleâ€™s adventures and stay inspired as you dream about all the places youâ€™ll go in the future.
Get new ideas learn about other cultures satiate your wanderlust and grow your to visitâ€? list.
Let your mind travel when your body canâ€™t.
Hereâ€™s a list of some travel books to get you started The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho Wild by Cheryl Strayed The Beach by Alex Garland All Godâ€™s Children Need Traveling Shoes by Maya Angelou In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson Turn Right at Machu Picchu by Mark Adams Video Night in Kathmandu by Pico Iyer Among the White Moon Faces by Shirley Geok-Lin Lim Ten Years a Nomad by me! which you should definitely get because itâ€™s the best â€” and supporting the team and me during these times would mean a lot!

Watch travel movies From far-fetched classics like Indiana Jones to biopics like Wild to documentaries like A Map for Staurday travel movies are another great way to satiate your wanderlust.

After all weâ€™re all gonna really need to get outside once this crisis is over! Trip planning will keep you busy and help make the days and weeks fly by.
First buy a guidebook.
I love getting lost in guidebooks and plotting itineraries and dreaming of the sights Iâ€™ll see.

Meet travelers near you Note At the moment this tip does not apply due to the quarantine but once it is lifted this can be a way to meet people in your local area.
Having a support network is vital.
You need people who wonâ€™t think youâ€™re weird when you tell them you want to hike across the Amazon.
You need people to say Can I join?â€? That why we started the Nomadic Network.
Itâ€™s an online and in-person meet-up group for travelers all around the world.
We host regular events every month in cities across the globe at least when this crisis is over.
Sign up use our forum to chat with people virtually and when this all over come meet up in person! Some other great websites for meeting people in real life are Meetup.com â€“ Thereâ€™s a group out there for everything.
I use this site frequently.
Couchsurfing â€“ Couchsurfing is more than a website that offers accommodation.
It has lot of local groups that hold events all the time.
It is a wonderful way to meet other travelers and locals â€” at home or on the road.
*** Coming home can be hard.
We all need a community that supports and understands us.
And while we canâ€™t meet that community in real life right now there are many ways you can bring the world to you while you are at home.
Use these tips.
Keep your travel spirits alive.
Plan a future trip.
The world will be waiting â€” and ready â€” for you when this is all over.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels.
I use them all the time.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.

You meet with the student regularly to show them local places share a holiday meal or just go out for coffee.
Itâ€™s great for families and a good alternative to having people actually stay in your home.
Reply Jess January 12 2017 at 223 pm Eat With is definitely one of my favorites! We could use more programs like this.
Reply TF January 12 2017 at 347 pm Youâ€™d be surprised how many smaller cities have international/exotic pockets.

Talking to them brought out their stories as well as tips about where to find ethnic restaurants.
Reply PB January 12 2017 at 557 pm Weâ€™re actually working on that! Not everyone can travel and even those that are able to canâ€™t do it all the time.
Reply Stephanie January 12 2017 at 851 pm Great suggestions! I notice that Iâ€™m much more openâ€? while traveling and itâ€™s hard to keep that mindset when Iâ€™m back in the daily grind.
Meeting other travelers â€“ or doing things I typically only do while traveling â€“ helps.
Iâ€™m a huge fan of Meetups! I belonged to several when I lived in Washington DC.
Now my husband and I are living in Japan and I started my own French conversation group.
Itâ€™s not only a great way to meet other French speakers but it gives me a channel to make Japanese friends.
Reply Alex Webb January 13 2017 at 834 pm Great article.
I particularly like the suggestion of bringing the world to you with couch surfing.
Wanting to see the world was a big reason why I left my hometown after high school and moved to Hong Kong for university.
It really opened up the world to me and introduced me to many new experiences that I couldnâ€™t have had otherwise.
I also was able to meet many new friends that I wouldnâ€™t know otherwise.
It really changed my life.
Now that Iâ€™m back in the States Iâ€™ve gotta say that I agreeâ€“post travel depression is real and it can feel tough to acclimate back to normal lifeâ€? in the culture you grew up in.
I think your advice in this regard trying to meet new people from different cultures etc.
is really true.
The world would be a much better place if more people were more open and willing to listen to people from different cultures.
Weâ€™re more similar than we may seem and learning about other ways of doing things and seeing the world is so important especially given debates about immigration going on around the world.
Reply Kenny January 14 2017 at 1157 am Music is another great way to bring the world to you.
Find music from the area you want to visit and it mentally transports you.
Along that vein I am the organizer for a World Music Meetup here in Boston and we have a blast getting a taste of the world in our own backyard via music.
When you do travel get a CD from the local scene and you have a great souvenir to remind yourself of that area when you return home.
Reply Joe January 15 2017 at 946 am Thereâ€™s a sense of this is boringâ€? once you return home.
CouchSurfing though is a great way to change that melancholy into excitement! My favorite host in Raleigh NC of all places brought me to another CouchSurferâ€™s house warming party! Three couples myself and a girl whose boyfriend was awayâ€¦ But I was no 8th wheel! They were all so inviting cooked amazing foodâ€¦ I enjoyed myself very much.
The CS community is pretty dandy! Reply NomadicMatt January 15 2017 at 957 am This is a perfect example of why I love Couchsurfing! Reply Natalie January 15 2017 at 1010 am This is such a great article.
I couldnâ€™t travel much last year but I actually did kind of bring the world to me.
I made several friends who are originally from Japan and one from Chile.
Though going to evening meet ups and gatherings is really not an option because I have toddlers.
However I am adventurous in meeting people talking to those who also have kids in particular.
I highly recommend saying hi to people and seeing what happens.
Reply Arianwen January 15 2017 at 136 pm Some great tips here! I definitely got post-trip depression after 10 months in Asia last year.
I went from having all the independence I could wish for to living back at home with my dad for half a year while a visa application in relation to an amazing job opportunity overseas failed! It feels good to be on the road again and doing Meetups etc again.

Reply Rebecca January 16 2017 at 842 am Post travel depression is real! Especially when your most recent trip was to Disneyworld! These are great ideas.

Reply Anna Colorista January 17 2017 at 1140 am Such a cool article! I definitely struggle with after travel depression on a regular basis and love to surround myself with like-minded people at home.
I also still attend university and enjoy spending time with exchange students learning their language or teaching them German.
Itâ€™s also a nice way to invite the world into your home ð?™‚ Reply Caren January 19 2017 at 839 am I also love listening to Podcasts and just the other day I found there was a Laos Buddhist monastery in the small Appalachian town Iâ€™m living in right now! They also run a super authentic restaurant and itâ€™s like being back in Southeast Asia all over again.
I loved this article because I really hate coming home after a trip but thereâ€™s tons of ways to make it better! Reply Jennifer January 19 2017 at 1230 pm Post- travel depression is so real.
Iâ€™m experiencing it now.
Funny this post came up during my reverse culture-shockâ€? state of mind.
Thanks Matt for sharing Reply Deepika May 15 2017 at 739 am I agree with you NomadicMatt coming home is often harder than leaving for a travel person.
But I never thought about it this way.
I will definitely try these.
Many of us often say I wish I could travel more but I donâ€™t have the money.â€? Or sometimes the issue isnâ€™t money but time.
Or energy.
Or children.
You have the best advice for these problems.

Reply Allison March 18 2020 at 240 am Iâ€™m glad everyone is writing articles like this for all of us who canâ€™t scratch our travel itch! But I would not recommend that Woody Allen film there are a million other films set in and about Paris that arenâ€™t directed by a person like him.
Reply Renuka Walter March 18 2020 at 509 am I like the fact that you mentioned about reading travel blogs.
This is a challenging time for all of us.
Letâ€™s hope to get on the other side soon.
Iâ€™m spending my time writing learning new things and just praying.
I hope this time is going to make all of us a lot humbler.
Reply Charelle March 21 2020 at 903 am Thanks Matt really helpful now we canâ€™t travel.
Luckily I also have your blogging course to keep me busy at the moment.
Hopefully times will get better soon and I hope you will feel better soon as well! Reply Sher March 26 2020 at 158 pm As an aspiring traveler but keeping a full-time job scratching that itch has been a skill I had to master.
I teach in a University International Relations so I have a natural love affair with maps but I sometimes find myself pinning destinations I want to visit next! Watching travel shows also help.
Up in the Air was something we were asked to watched in grad school and I never looked back when I started to love flying.
And yes I think I have watched almost every single episode of Anthony Bourdainâ€™s shows! Reply Kanak March 27 2020 at 522 am I am the organizer for a World Music Meetup here in Boston and we have a blast getting a taste of the world in our own backyard via music.
