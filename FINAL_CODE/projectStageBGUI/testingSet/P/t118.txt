I spent years teaching in Thailand and Taiwan and they were some of the most impactful experiences of my traveling.
Living in a foreign culture trying to get by day to day and learning to create a life for yourself is a surefire way to become a more confident you and give you a deeper understanding of yourself.
I get a lot of emails from people about teaching overseas and one of the most asked about destinations is Spain! While weâ€™ve written about the destination before I wanted to add in another perspective from someone who just did it last year.
Natasha is a local Austinite who graduated from school and moved to Spain for a year.
Here she is explaining how she did it and how you can too! Tell us about yourself! Natasha I was born in Atlanta Georgia but my family moved to India when I was two months old.
After a year we moved to Australia where I grew up until I was 9.
Then we moved to Vancouver where I stayed until I was 15.
I consider myself to be from Australia Canada and the US in almost equal parts and ethnically I am Indian and Pakistani.
I double-majored in international relations and Latin American studies at UT-Austin.
In my free time I make YouTube videos about travel and I am devoted to health and fitness.
I also cook and practice yoga.
You recently spent some time teaching in Spain.
Tell us how you got started doing that.
Was it easy to figure out the process and find a job? I studied abroad in Madrid in college.
While I was there I met some people who were English-language assistants and kept in touch with them after I returned home.
I knew I wanted to take a gap year and travel after graduation so I reached out to them and they told me about different programs I could apply for.
I looked into a few but the government program Auxiliares de ConversaciÃ³nâ€? was free and had good reviews so I chose to apply to that one.
It allows Americans and Canadians to visit and work as teaching assistants.
Youâ€™ll be paired with a teacher and help the students learn English.
There are similar programs for people from other English-speaking countries as well.
The application is quite daunting.
It required an essay two letters of recommendation a lot of legal paperwork and other forms.
The essay I wrote was about a page long essentially a letter of intent explaining why I was interested in the program and the qualities that make me fit for the position.
The program also requires an official college transcript as well but it accepts applicants from diverse educational backgrounds.
so as long as you show keen interest have good letters of recommendation and have decent grades you should be fine! I didnâ€™t decide to join this program until the beginning of March but I would suggest starting the process as soon as it is available in January.
That will give you more time to jump through all the bureaucratic hoops.
After receiving your acceptance I suggest booking your visa appointment immediately as these fill up fast! Did you have any prior teaching experience? Is experience necessary? I didnâ€™t have any teaching experience and the Auxiliar de ConversaciÃ³n program doesnâ€™t require you to.
As long as you have or are completing your bachelorâ€™s degree and are a native English speaker you are eligible.
What was an average day like? You are only required to work 12-16 hours a week with this program so a workday is typically about four hours.
Since weâ€™re English-language assistants we are paired with an English teacher and donâ€™t have to create a curriculum for the whole class.
On an average day as an auxiliar the teacher I worked with would mostly have me walk around and assist students with the activities she had assigned them to do.
Since I was an assistant and not the main teacher my job mostly consisted of providing help like that.
The teacher for the younger grades would have me work one-on-one with students that were falling behind or had special needs to give them more attention but we usually worked on the same activities as the other students.
For about 10-15 minutes of the class I would sometimes give a presentation or play vocabulary games such as Bingo or Hangman.
I was never required to teach an entire lesson but I would occasionally have to manage small groups of students.
This allowed them to participate more since they would not be as shy to speak English and itâ€™s easier to control a few students than a whole class.
Regarding the actual teaching it was the easiest and smoothest part of my time in Spain.
As long as you can keep the students interested and engaged you wonâ€™t have any issues.
Did you have any unexpected challenges? Many! I lived about an hourâ€™s walk from my school which was inconvenient and isolating.
It took me a while to figure out the bus system so adapting to my location was the first challenge.
However the biggest challenge I faced was having to come back to the US for a month because I didnâ€™t have a visa.
I was informed that I didnâ€™t need a visa prior to entering Spain but upon arrival I would need to get my NIE NÃºmero de Identidad de Extranjero and I would be set.
Well when I arrived I was the only applicant without a visa.
I went to eight different foreign consulates and no one knew if I had to leave Spain to get a visa.
Ultimately I had to fly back to the US score an almost-impossible-to-get appointment with the Spanish consulate and get my visa.
The bureaucratic system is slow and very tedious so try to talk to former auxiliares if you can there are lots of Facebook groups for this.
What is one thing you wish you knew before you started teaching? I wish I knew that one personâ€™s experience could be very different from the next.
I had an amazing overall experience however parts of my life didnâ€™t go as I expected.
I went in expecting to make great connections with my colleagues more than anyone else but the environment at the school I worked at wasnâ€™t very welcoming.
A lot of teachers at my school didnâ€™t live in the community they commuted from pueblos as far as an hour away.
This made it hard to form close friendships.
Moreover my school was comprised of teachers who were still completing their exams so every year the teachers changed schools.
That meant that the sense of community was not very strong.
Fortunately I became friends with other auxiliares in my area and was welcomed warmly into their community.
I became friends with teachers at other schools took trips with them and received lots of help with life in general in Spain.
What kind of salary can auxiliares expect? Auxiliares earn a scholarshipâ€? rather than a salary.
I was paid 1000 EUR/month $1100 USD during my contract.
I would say that one should expect around 700-1000 EUR per month $770-1100 USD or about 15 EUR/hour $16.50 USD.
Auxiliares in Madrid received the same scholarshipâ€? as I did but the cost of living in that region is much higher.
If you are paid 700 EUR you usually work 12 hours a week instead of 16 and you can definitely try and teach private English lessons to earn more.
What are your top three tips for someone interested in teaching in Spain? 1.
Arrive with at enough to live off of for at least three months.
I was fortunate to live in a city with decent prices for accommodation.
I had two roommates and spent around 250 EUR/month $275 USD on rent.
Groceries rent and transportation were my main expenses around 650 EUR $715 USD for all of those plus some miscellaneous things.
This left me with just a bit of money to use for travel.
In the Valencia region the government was three months late to start paying us and always late by at least a few days to a week after the first paycheck.
Since itâ€™s not a lot of money youâ€™ll want to have a lot of savings.
That way if youâ€™re paid late you will have enough money to get by.
2.
Research where you want to work.
I chose Madrid as my first choice and AndalucÃ­a as my second.
I would have also liked to live in Barcelona but that wasnâ€™t an option.
I applied late to the program and existing auxiliares have priority for where they are stationed.
As a new applicant and a late one I was sent to Valencia.
When choosing regions be aware that a region does not necessarily mean you will end up in the city itâ€™s named for.
By that I mean the Madridâ€? region does not only mean the city of Madrid but rather the entire region around the city.
Regions are like states and so you could end up living two hours or more from the capital of the region.
You should also take into account the language spoken in the region.
Where I lived people spoke Valenciano just as much if not more than Spanish and school was conducted in valenciano a dialect of Catalan.
Luckily Valenciano has similarities to Spanish.
However if youâ€™re placed in the Basque Country northern Spain they speak Euskara which has no similarities to Spanish.
So if your goal is to practice or learn Spanish make sure you choose to live in a region that speaks it.
Weather is another aspect to consider.
While in the summer it is warm almost everywhere winters can be quite cold more so in the north.
If youâ€™re not a fan of cold weather consider living closer to the south and the sea.
There are auxiliar Facebook groups and blogs that have plenty of information and anecdotes about different regions which can help you make your decision.
3.
Learn some Spanish.
Understand that you could be placed in a pueblo very far from a big city so brush up on your Spanish a little.
It isnâ€™t mandatory to teach English but it will really come in handy if youâ€™re in a smaller location and want to connect more with the locals and your colleagues.
