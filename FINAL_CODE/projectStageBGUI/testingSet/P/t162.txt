Itâ€™s a city on everyoneâ€™s bucket list.
Iâ€™ve been dozens of times and my love for the city is well known to you all.
I canâ€™t imagine a year in which I donâ€™t go even for a little bit.
To me Paris has it all music history food culture and beautiful architecture.
Itâ€™s got that special something.
I dream of moving to Paris to live out that writer clichÃ©â€¦if only for a while! As a visitor to Paris knowing where to stay can be difficult.
There are lots of arrondissements neighborhoods.
Which is the best? For a tourist thereâ€™s really no bad neighborhood.
Nowhere you stay is going to be too far or unsafe forget what you hear about in the news.
Parisâ€™s metro goes everywhere and stays open late.
However that said Paris has hundreds and hostels.
How do you know which are the best ones? The city is expensive and as someone who has stayed in some less-than-stellar accommodations for way too much money I know the price of making the wrong decision.
Iâ€™ve been visiting Paris for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Paris are Location â€“ Paris is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In Paris you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Paris that I like the most.

One of my friends also swears by Smart Place near Gare du Nord altho I donâ€™t think itâ€™s on the cheaper end for hostels.
People say Paris is expensive but Iâ€™m always able to find a good deal with a hostel or Airbnb and stick to my budget ð?™‚ Paris me manque! Reply Alice Ross November 14 2018 at 1134 am I stayed in Oops Hostel on my last trip to Paris.
Affordable price cozy room and the neighborhood is just my taste.
The other hostles in this post look great and Iâ€™ll definitely book one on my next trip! Reply Andrea November 17 2018 at 601 am They are actually called arrondissements not androssiments.
There are 20 of them.
Itâ€™s common for Parisians to refer to them and the arrondissement is listed on street signs as well.
As a visitor to Paris itâ€™s helpful to be familiar with them.
Reply NomadicMatt November 29 2018 at 1024 am I fixed the spelling.
Thanks.
Reply Matthew Bailey November 18 2018 at 652 pm Paris is still high on the bucketlist.
