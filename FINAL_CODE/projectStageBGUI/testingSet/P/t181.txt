Heck I love it so much that Iâ€™m currently living here! This city has it all â€“ and it would take a lifetime to really see.
Even after a decade of visiting and months living here Iâ€™m still finding new things to see and do! And while the city itself has a million and one sights to visit there are also some fantastic day trips from Paris that can help you escape the city â€“ and see what else this incredible country has to offer.
From historic vineyards to medieval castles to cheesy tourist sites thereâ€™s a lot within a short distance from the city.
Here are some of the best day trips from Paris at least in my opinion Table of Contents The Palace of Versailles ChÃ¢teau de Fontainebleau ChÃ¢teau de Chantilly Reims The D-Day Beaches Giverny Champagne Rouen OrlÃ©ans Disneyland 1.
The Palace of Versailles From its exquisite gardens to its lavish interiors the Palace of Versailles is truly a sight to be seen.
Located just 20km from Paris it was the primary residence of the kings of France for over 100 years until the French Revolution.
Once just a tiny hunting lodge it was initially transformed into a proper chÃ¢teau by Louis XIII who bought up the surrounding land to extend his park and gardens.
Eventually Louis XIV aka the Sun King turned this into lavish country estate as a way to escape Paris and diminish the grip of the French nobility.
A massive and decadent symbol of royal power Versailles offers an incredible insight into French history highlighting the ostentatious lives of the former monarchs.
The Palace of Versailles is one of the most-visited attractions in the vicinity of Paris with over 10 million people swarming the grounds each year.
To avoid the worst crowds try to visit during the week.
Place dâ€™Armes Versailles +33 1 30 83 78 00 en.chÃ¢teauversailles.fr.
Open Tuesdayâ€“Sunday 9amâ€“530pm with the last entry at 5pm closed Mondays.
The Passportâ€? ticket will give you admission to all the palace tours grounds Trianon Palaces and Marie Antoinetteâ€™s estate the Musical Fountain Show the Musical Gardens and the exhibitions it costs 27 EUR for one day or 30 EUR for two days.
To get there take the RER Line C to Versailles Chateau or the SNCF train from Gare Montparnasse to Versailles Chantiers.
2.
ChÃ¢teau de Fontainebleau Located about 75km from Paris this is one of the largest royal estates in the country.
Built in the 12th century it was inhabited continuously for over seven centuries and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site as well as a national museum.
The origins of the palace also date back to a hunting lodge used by the kings of France with additions being built throughout the years the most elaborate of which are from the 14th and 15th centuries.
Much like Versailles there are lavish rooms and apartments here including a grandiose and ornate ballroom as well as the throne of Napoleon.
The chÃ¢teau was also used as a NATO base of operations after World War II until 1966 when it was restored gaining UNESCO status in 1981.

Reims grew to prominence during the Roman Empire and when the CathÃ©drale Notre-Dame de Reims Reims Cathedral was completed in the 15th century it became the place where every king of France was crowned with a few exceptions.
Much like Notre-Dame in Paris this Gothic cathedral boasts two large towers.

The D-Day Beaches On June 6 1944 the Allied forces invaded Normandy in what is known as Operation Overlord.
Almost 160000 troops crossed the English Channel that day.
Today you can visit some of the remaining fortifications and bunkers as well as several cemeteries and museums.
The beaches are located just under three hours from Paris by car which is the best way to explore the region as youâ€™ll have more freedom and flexibility with your schedule.

6.
Giverny This picturesque village is 80km from Paris and is famous for being the home of renowned painter Claude Monet the founder of the impressionist movement.

Champagne The Champagne region is known for â€” you guessed it â€” producing champagne.
Only wines that come from this region are technically allowed to be called Champagneâ€? which makes this the epicenter of all things champagne.

If you donâ€™t have a car you can take a tour with Walks of Paris which runs trips to the area.

OrlÃ©ans This gorgeous city is located on the Loire River about 2 hours from Paris.
Youâ€™ll find gorgeous medieval half-timber houses that really give OrlÃ©ans a traditional European feel.
There are tons of medieval buildings still in use many dating back to the 14th and 15th century.
There are some incredible museums here too including the sobering MusÃ©e MÃ©morial des enfants du Vel dâ€™Hiv which highlights the deportation of Jews and Roma to concentration camps during World War II and the Joan of Arc museum.

If I ever visit Paris Iâ€™m sure to explore a lot of countryside around it.
Wowâ€¦so you are now living in Paris! Thatâ€™s so cool.
Is Paris really snobbish? Reply NomadicMatt June 6 2019 at 515 am Not at all! Reply John June 11 2019 at 1055 am Awesome post! I am going to Paris this coming weekend and looked for some inspiration.
Now I certainly know some of the places im going to visit ð?™‚ Reply Dee June 12 2019 at 1047 am We took a train from Paris to Caen WHY donâ€™t we have trains in the U.S.
like this?!!! then rented a car to get to Omaha Beach which I highly recommend! Walking the beach looking up at the cliff where the Nazis gun bunkers not sure of the term are embedded really gives one a sense of what the troops were facing when they landed.
Then the cemetery at the top memorial statues really really moving and profound.
I donâ€™t recommend not reserving the car in Caen ahead of time luckily for us a car had been returned during the night and they rented it to us! It was my first overseas trip I had ever arranged and I was winging it most of the time.
lol.
Also wish they had pointed out the difference between the speedometer and the speed limit signs.
One was in kilometers Km and one was in miles per hour mph geeeeeez.
I forget which was which but I still feel like I should apologize to everyone in the area for driving like a speed demon! Great list Matt.
Iâ€™ll use it for my next trip to France! Reply Richard K June 13 2019 at 114 pm Yes The Palace of Versailles is wonderful and I would like to visit it just like these many castles.
Visit a vineyard in the Champagne region a dream.
As soon as my trip to Paris is planned your guidebook to Paris for budget travelers will interest me.
Reply Clemens June 17 2019 at 849 am Damn why is everyone staying in Paris? There are so many things to see outside of the city.
Great list Matt! Reply Glenn August 27 2019 at 806 pm I found the Palace of Versailles hard to enjoy due to the ridiculous crowds.
We were packed in like sardines! Still it is an incredibly beautiful place and I really enjoyed wandering the gardens and the smaller palaces.
I only had a week in Paris but would like to visit some of the other places on this list.
