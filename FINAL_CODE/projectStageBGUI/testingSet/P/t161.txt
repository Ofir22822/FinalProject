Accommodation in NYC is not cheap â€” and itâ€™s often hard to find deals.
Thatâ€™s in part by design.
There used to be a lot of hostels in NYC but the hotel lobby got the city to use an old law meant to block tenements and limit the number of people that could stay in a single room.
This effectively shut down most of the hostels in town except for a few that were grandfathered in.
Now youâ€™re only going to find a few hostels left.
Demand outstrips supply.
Even though there arenâ€™t hundreds of hostels to choose from there are enough to make a best hostels in NYCâ€? post so youâ€™ll know which are worth staying at there are a few that are really terrible and to be avoided.
Over the years Iâ€™ve stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in NYC are Location â€“ New York is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In NYC you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and some have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in New York City that I like the most.
