It’s a country filled with incredible relics of ancient history from the Pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza and offers tons of incredible activities for travelers of all walks of life.
Floating down the Nile River on a traditional felucca exploring the tombs of Tutankhamen and other pharaohs in the Valley of the Kings snorkeling and diving in the coral fantasyland of the Red Sea — there’s just so many amazing parts of Egypt to amaze and enthrall you.
These days Egypt is a destination many travelers shy away from.
Given that there have been some terrorist attacks targeting tourists over the last couple of decades and that people are still wary of the changes in government since the Arab Spring those concerns are understandable.
However since 2017 tourism numbers have begun to increase again.
In fact they are growing so fast they might hit an all-time record in 2019 or 2020.
Things have been changing for the better in Egypt and it’s now a safe country to visit for the intrepid traveler.
That means it’s time to start planning your dream trip to this diverse and historic country.
While I am a huge fan of solo travel distances between the most popular sights in Egypt are pretty far.
You can expect to spend a full day or night traveling by road or rail between Cairo and Luxor for example so joining an organized tour can help you make the most of your time.
And it can also save you some money too! Tours in Egypt often work out to be cheaper than trying to put together your own trip as some will include domestic airfare for prices cheaper than you’ll be able to get on your own.
Taking a tour with a reputable company also ensures that you’ll have safe detours with someone who really knows the lay of the land and will keep you informed of any risks.
Knowledgeable tour guides also make for a more interesting trip — which is why tours in Egypt are so popular.
Here is a list of the best tour companies in Egypt offering everything from day trips around Cairo to multiday tours around the country 1.
Intrepid Intrepid is one of my favorite tour companies in the world.
I’ve been on a handful of their tours over the years to destinations all around the world and have yet to be disappointed.
Their local guides provide invaluable insight and they are dedicated to making environmentally friendly choices too.
And the company just hires really awesome people too.
In Egypt Intrepid has tours that range between eight and fifteen days.
To be able to see enough in just eight days they fly you between Cairo and the south so the cheaper trip is actually the 15-day one which uses a mix of bus boat and train travel starting around $1200 USD.
Intrepid also has some specialized offerings with a nine-day trip for travelers aged 18–29 trips especially for families and also one just for solo travelers.
If you’re keen to explore beyond Egypt Intrepid also offers a range of longer tours that take in Jordan Israel and Palestine as well.

The popular Luxor-to-Aswan trip along the Nile can be made in a variety of pretty luxurious ships prices are around $500 USD per person for a four-day trip.

Many of these take in the key sights like the Pyramids a Nile cruise and the Luxor and Karnak Temples and typically fly you back to Cairo.
The costs vary depending on the extra activities involved but are pretty reasonable small group tours covering the main sights from Cairo to Luxor start at $1100 USD.
They also offer some specialized tours such as one specifically designed to accommodate wheelchair users.

It specializes in having knowledgeable guides that make the history of Egypt really come alive giving incredible insight into modern-day Egyptian life as well.
The company also has a sense of social responsibility too using locally owned restaurants and hotels on all trips and hiring guides from communities throughout the country.
Look at Egypt Tours runs a variety of day trips out of the main centers including Cairo Alexandria Luxor and Sharm el-Sheikh ranging in cost between $50 and $150 USD per person depending on the destination and the group size.

4.
On the Go Tours On the Go Tours has been running tours to a variety of countries for a couple of decades now but it all started in Egypt where the two founders met.
The company focuses on sustainable travel and supports local communities and it hires local guides who have studied Egyptology at a college level as well.
In Egypt they run several great-value group tours like an eight-day trip from Cairo to Luxor for $400 USD which includes the Pyramids of Giza the incredible Egyptian Museum in Cairo the temples at Luxor a two-night felucca cruise on the Nile a visit to the Valley of the Kings and more.
Accommodations are more budget-oriented than many other tour companies making this a great option for backpackers.
If your timing and budget are more flexible you might also take a look at some of On the Go’s festival tours timed to celebrations like the Abu Simbel Sun Festival or the King Ramses Sun Festival.
These tours are typically around ten days long and range between $1600 and $2800 USD per person depending on whether they include internal flights.
5.
Jakada Tours Egypt Jakada Tours is a smaller company that offers private tours as well as group trips with a focus on budget mid-range travel.
Trips covering many of Egypt’s highlights and lasting between seven and ten days range from $600 to $1000 USD.
If you’re on your second trip to Egypt or have some extra time Jakada also offers a range of more unusual tours like spending time at the Cairo camel market! The company also makes sure its guides are really knowledgeable not just about ancient history but modern Egyptian culture too as well as all the best local tips and tricks to help you make the most out of your stay.
6.
Exodus Travels Exodus offers trips worldwide and has a reputable social conscience they aim to give back to the local communities they are a part of.
In Egypt they support Animal Care in Egypt ACE and its tours often include an option to visit the charity’s facility.
Exodus offers a nine-day Nile cruise from Luxor which is a good compromise between luxury and price around $1400 USD per person all-inclusive with a maximum of 20 passengers.
The company also has a longer trip that takes in key sights like the Valley of the Kings as well as Alexandria this two-week tour starts at $2000 USD.
7.
Beyond the Nile Tours Beyond the Nile Tours is another Egypt-based tour company using local highly educated guides with lots of historical and cultural knowledge.
It offers three tours ranging between eight days and two weeks in length on all of them you can be flexible with your budget as some activities like a balloon ride over the Pyramids $100 USD are optional.
All these tours kick off in Cairo with a full day exploring what we all dream of seeing — the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphnix — along with the Egyptian Museum to put the history into context.
Then you’re flown down to Luxor and cruise from there to the Valley of the Kings among other places.
On the longer trips you can choose to travel back north more slowly or you can include several days relaxing at a Red Sea resort.
Tour prices range from $1200 to $1400 USD per person with some additional costs for extra activities.
*** As much as I love solo travel planning a trip to Egypt is much easier with a tour company.
While you probably know that you want to see the Pyramids the Nile and other historical sites getting around is not that easy to organize in advance so it’s good to have the local knowledge of Egyptian guides to make sure you’re both safe and getting the most out of your trip.
So whether you’re after a short tour hitting the highlights of Egypt in a week or have more time to explore the country a little more slowly or even spend some time relaxing at the Red Sea you’ll find a tour company to help you out.
Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
I use them all the time.
