Itâ€™s filled with delicious food thereâ€™s lots of amazing sushi here spacious parks donâ€™t miss Stanley Park and is close to both the mountains and the ocean.
The city consistently ranks in the top five best places to live in the world â€” and itâ€™s no surprise why.
Itâ€™s a wonderful wonderful city that Iâ€™ve loved ever since I first visited in 2004 with my family.
Since then Iâ€™ve come back a handful of times to explore it on my own.
Iâ€™ve seen the city change a lot of the last fifteen years â€” and one of the things that has changed for the benefit of us travelers is that there are a lot more hostels.
Vancouver now has one of the best hostel scenes in Canada and you wonâ€™t be disappointed with what you find here.
That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Vancouver are Location â€“ Vancouver is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In Vancouver you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Vancouver that I like the most.
If you donâ€™t want to read the longer list below the following hostels are the best in each category Best Hostel for Budget Travelers Vancouver Backpacker House Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers HI Vancouver Downtown Best Hostel for Families HI Vancouver Central Best Hostel for Partying Cambie Hostel Gastown or Cambie Hostel Seymour Best Hostel for Digital Nomads HI Vancouver Downtown Best Overall Hostel Samesun Vancouver Want the specifics of each hostel? Hereâ€™s my comprehensive list of the best hostels in Vancouver Price Legend per night $ = Under $25 USD $$ = $25-30 USD $$$ = Over $30 USD 1.
Cambie Hostel Seymour Cambie Hostel Seymour is located in Gastown a hip area of Vancouver loaded with bars and restaurants.
This hostel is pretty basic and small dorms are two or four beds and the hostel itself doesnâ€™t have much ambience expect bare rooms and bathrooms in need of a refresh.
But guests donâ€™t stay here because of the property they stay because of its prime location and easy access to other destinations in the city and to the airport.
But there is a common area and a chill roomâ€? which comes complete with its very own hostel cat.
If youâ€™re cooking the kitchen isnâ€™t huge and seating is limited but the hostel also makes it easy to go out and dine.
They offer $5 off breakfast at the popular Cambie Bar a part of the Gastown sister hostel a quick walk down the road see below.
Below the hostel is the popular Maloneâ€™s Social Lounge & Tap the reason for the late-night noise and Chihuahuas Mexican Grill so you can eat and drink without going far.
Because of its proximity to the bars it gets loud at night.
If you want a lively hostel stay here.
Cambie Hostel Seymour at a Glance $$ Bar below the hostel with discounts Lively social atmosphere makes it easy to meet people Laid-back common areas for hanging out and relaxing Beds from $25 USD privates from $55 USD for the night â€”> Book your stay at Cambie Hostel Seymour! 2.
Cambie Hostel Gastown This Gastown hostel offers comfortable beds a small common room to meet and mingle in and access to Gastownâ€™s restaurants and bars.
This includes The Cambie the hostelâ€™s bar which draws in crowds of locals.
It can get incredibly loud so bring some noise-cancelling headphones because basic earplugs wonâ€™t cut it.
Like its sister hostel a few blocks away thereâ€™s also housecat to keep you company if youâ€™re allergic to cars bring allergy meds.
Housed in a building dating back to the late 1800s itâ€™s in need of a little renovation.
The hostel has a small kitchen and the showers are close to the toilets which makes it cramped.
Its location is its main selling point though so if youâ€™re not expecting anything special other than direct access to Gastown and all it has to offer this is a good place for you.
Cambie Hostel Gastown at a Glance $ Great place to meet other travelers Central location right downtown Bar on-site for hanging out and mingling Beds from $23 USD rooms from $53 USD a night â€”> Book your stay at Cambie Hostel Gastown! 3.
HI Vancouver Central Like many of the other hostels in town HI Vancouver Central is an old building which means the property could use a little love.
Fortunately the rooms here offer comfortable beds and every room has a ensuite bathroom.
Choose from two-bed or four-bed dorms or private four-bed rooms.
Located on Granville Street itâ€™s in the heart of the action with many pubs and clubs around making it noisy at night but lively and fun too.
The hostel has a free breakfast serving bagels and other baked goods as well as some fruit and cereal.
It has a small common room and basic kitchen with only a toaster microwave and kettle.
HI also offers tours daily to destinations around town as well as a pub crawl.
HI Vancouver Central at a Glance $$ Organizes lots of activities walking tours pub crawls Large private rooms great for families Free breakfast Beds from $29 USD a night rooms from $52 USD a night â€”> Book your stay at HI Vancouver Central! 4.
HI Vancouver Downtown Tucked into a quieter part of the city HI Vancouver Downtown is a good spot for heading out to explore popular Granville and Davie Streets which offer plenty of cafÃ©s restaurants and shopping.
Itâ€™s also a quick walk to the beach and ferries to Granville Island where youâ€™ll find lots of shopping as well as walking distance to the beautiful Stanley Park.
The hostel itself isnâ€™t all that impressive the dorms donâ€™t have enough outlets to accommodate every bed the bathrooms are old and can be a bit musty and the Wi-Fi doesnâ€™t work very well.
But the hostel does have a free continental breakfast a game room with foosball and pool a library and a TV room.
It also runs tours and has bike rentals so you can easily explore more of the city.
HI Vancouver Downtown at a Glance $$ Lots of common areas so itâ€™s easy to meet people Free breakfast Organizes lots of activities Beds from $29 USD rooms from $71 USD a night â€”> Book your stay at HI Vancouver Downtown! 5.
Samesun Vancouver The Samesun chain of hostels consistently rank as some of the best in the cities where they are located.
Samesun Vancouver is no exception.
My favorite feature of this hostel is in the six-bed dorms which offer cozy pod beds and give you a bit more privacy than normal bunks as well as your own light shelf and outlets.
The bathrooms are clean and there are plenty of them so youâ€™re not left waiting in line.
Thereâ€™s a lot to love at this hostel.
Itâ€™s has a decent free breakfast including eggs and hot cereal a full kitchen common areas for meeting people and relaxing daily hikes and even the Beaver Bar a lounge serving food and beer with a daily happy hour.
The only real downsides of Samesun are the small rooms itâ€™s hard to maneuver in the four-bed dorm the lack of elevators so youâ€™ve got to haul your belongings up flights of stairs and Wi-Fi that doesnâ€™t work well if at all.
Its location is excellent however itâ€™s in the Granville district which is loaded with bars and restaurants and near historic Gastown.
Like most other hostels in the city itâ€™s located in an area where the bars are open late so if youâ€™re sensitive to noise bring earplugs.
Samesun Vancouver at a Glance $$ Bar on-site for hanging out and meeting people Convenient location in Granville lots of bars and restaurants nearby Free breakfast Beds from $27 USD rooms from $75 USD a night â€”> Book your stay at Samesun Vancouver! 6.
Vancouver Backpacker House The Vancouver Backpacker House is about as barebones as it can get â€” it has only a self-check-in so you have to contact the staff in advance it does not accept credit cards without a huge fee the rooms donâ€™t have enough lockers and its location is not in the city proper.
It also has some interesting house rules like not all of the bathrooms are open to use all of the time.
The 10-bed dorm room is in the basement and oddly the private rooms have interior windows.
Depending on the room you book you may have to walk to another building once youâ€™ve checked in.
But if youâ€™re on a tight budget and the other hostels are packed this place works.
Itâ€™s near public transit that takes you into the city in about 15 minutes.
Vancouver Backpacker House at a Glance $ Super affordable accommodation Laid back atmosphere Beds from $22 USD rooms from $41 USD a night â€”> Book your stay at Vancouver Backpacker House! *** While the hostel scene in Vancouver may not be as extensive as other parts of the world youâ€™ll still find lots of suitable options here.
In an expensive city like Vancouver hostels are your best option if youâ€™re on a budget â€” especially if youâ€™re looking to enjoy the cityâ€™s rambunctious nightlife.
Just make sure you have some good earplugs or noise-canceling headphones if youâ€™re a light sleeper.
This is a lively city after all! Book Your Trip to Vancouver Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
