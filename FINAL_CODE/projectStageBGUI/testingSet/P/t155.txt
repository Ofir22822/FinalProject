With its picturesque historic Old Town that dates back to the 13th century it has been drawing in tourists since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Cheap flights cheap prices and the beauty of Prague without the crowds have made Tallinn an appealing weekend getaway for Europeans.
I visited the city on a trip from Finland â€” thereâ€™s a frequent ferry service between the two cities â€” and was enamored by it.
It was a blend of Nordic and Baltic culture with plenty of things to see and do.
Best of all it was super affordable! Though the city has become a bit more crowded and expensive in the last couple of years itâ€™s still one of my favorite places in the region.
Itâ€™s peaceful and wonderful the people are open and relaxed and the country is super tech-forward they offer e-residency services specifically for digital nomads.
To help you make the most out of your trip here are the best things to see and do in Tallinn â€” from the super touristy to off the beaten trail! 1.
Take a Free Walking Tour One of the best things you can do when you arrive in a new city is to take a free walking tour.
Theyâ€™re a great way to learn about a destination and its history while taking in the main sights.
Not only will it give you a solid introduction to the city but youâ€™ll get access to a local guide who can answer any and all questions you might have.
EstAdventures has a few different free tour options including general walking tours tours focused on the cityâ€™s communist past and street art tours.

Glehn Park & Castle Glehn Park located on the Nomme hillside is home to medieval-style Glehn Castle.
Built in 1886 both the park and castle were created by Nikolai von Glehn a rich and eclectic man known for his unusual taste in decoration such as tables and chairs carved like figurines large statues and an obelisk in front of his house marking the grave of his favorite horse.
Unfortunately most of the castle was looted during World War I so none of the unique pieces of furniture he created remain.
However youâ€™ll still get to see the statues he built on the grounds of the park.
Thereâ€™s also an observatory tower and palm house which has a gorgeous mosaic rooftop.
Itâ€™s a good place to relax go for a walk or go skiing during wintertime.

Bastion Tunnels These tunnels were initially built in the 17th century as an addition to the Kiek in de KÃ¶k Peek in the Kitchen tower and were intended for storage.

After the Soviets left Tallinn they were dumped here and ignored.

Itâ€™s a surreal place to visit â€” especially when you realize it hasnâ€™t even been 30 years since Estonia achieved independence and these statues were left to fade into history.

It is a really massive cool medieval ruin.
The entrance fee is not expensive and wandering around was very peaceful.

I found one in the Kalamaja neighborhood.
