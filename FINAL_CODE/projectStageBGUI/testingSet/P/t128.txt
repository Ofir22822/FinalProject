Itâ€™s also one of the cheapest countries in the world.
I didnâ€™t have high expectations when I first visited in 2006.
Back then all I knew about Cambodia was its awful history involving the Khmer Rouge and that it was home to Angkor Wat.
But I was blown away by the people and their warmth spirit and hospitality the beautiful natural scenery and the countryâ€™s long history.
It was wonderful and I ended up staying weeks longer than I thought I would I especially loved Phnom Penh.
I returned often including spending over a month there when I was writing my first book.
It made for a great base of operations.
In the last decade or so Cambodia has grown by leaps and bounds.
Sleepy little towns I visited before are now megacities tourists especially Russians and Chinese visit en masse there are more ATMs there was exactly one in the country when I first went and thereâ€™s a growing expat and foodie scene.
Cambodia still has problems but itâ€™s a lot more cosmopolitan today than when I first went.
What should you do when you visit Cambodia? How should you plan your trip? Below are some itineraries that include the best destinations in Cambodia.
You can use them as a guideline to help you make the most of your trip! What to See and Do in Cambodia A One-Week Itinerary Day 1 â€“ Phnom Penh The capital of Cambodia Phnom Penh has a Wild West ambiance with dusty streets and a devil may careâ€? atmosphere.
It has a few good attractions and an up-and-coming foodie scene.
The main attraction is the Royal Palace.
Start there and donâ€™t miss the beautiful flower gardens and the Silver Pagoda whose floor is made up of more than 5000 silver tiles inside is an emerald-covered Buddha and a diamond-covered Maitreya Buddha.
It also has murals around its outer wall that tell the story of the Ramayana.
On the palace grounds are five stupas with the two largest to the east containing the ashes of King Norodom and King Udung the two most famous kings of modern Cambodia and a statue of King Norodom on horseback.
Admission is $10 USD for foreigners.
After seeing the palace learn about the countryâ€™s tragic not-too-distant history.
The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is a former school where the Khmer Rouge interrogated and tortured people in the 1970s.
Youâ€™ll see rusty beds and torture devices in sharp contrast to the beautiful trees and lovely jasmine smell in the gardens.
Admission is $5 USD for adults and $3 USD for anyone under 18.
Afterward head to the Killing Fields about 14km from Tuol Sleng.
Although a visit to Choeung Ek the best-known site may not be the most cheerful way to spend an afternoon it makes for a hallowed and memorable experience a testament to the dangers of uncontested power.
You wonâ€™t believe the memorial building in the center that is filled with skulls.
Admission is only $3 USD expect to pay at least $15 USD for a return-trip tuk-tuk ride.
Tip Visit the museum before heading to the Killing Fields as it will open your eyes to the atrocities that happened here.
Where to Stay in Phnom Penh Sla Boutique Hostel â€“ This is a pretty nice hostel not far from restaurants bars and attractions.
Itâ€™s clean and the beds are comfy and have privacy curtains.
The staff especially Mr.
Star are super friendly and they can really help you plan your trip.
Day 2 â€“ Phnom Penh Spend your second day wandering around the city and start by seeing the Independence Monument designed by architect Vann Molyvann and inaugurated in 1958.
It was created to mark Cambodiaâ€™s independence from French rule though it also serves as a de facto war memorial.
Itâ€™s one of the biggest landmarks in the city and a good place to start your day.
If youâ€™re in the city on a weekend try to catch an architectural walking tour with KA Tours which has excellent guides who are students or experts in architecture plus theyâ€™re not very expensive at around $15.
Check out the Cambodian Living Arts Center a traditional dance school and performance center where you can watch students in training and see traditional live theatre.
This is a fun way to spend a couple of hours while learning about the artistic traditions of the country.
You can also take part in a workshop which last around 90 minutes and cost $15 USD per person.
Make sure you stroll along Sisowath Quay on the Mekong River.
The 3km walkway is busy and full of restaurants bars cafÃ©s and shops.
Day 3 â€“ Sihanoukville Get an early start and take a five-hour bus ride to Sihanoukville named after the ruling prince of Cambodia in 1964.
It was a lazy beach town until about 2010 when it took off with travelers and tons of Chinese and Russian tourists on package tours because of its white-sand beaches nearby deserted islands excellent diving and delicious seafood.
Its varied nightlife filled with cheap booze makes it the premier backpacker party city in Cambodia.
If youâ€™re looking to soak up some sun Independence Beach and Otres Beach are probably your best bets.
Serendipity Beach used to be a great party spot but thereâ€™s a lot of Chinese development going on now so I wouldnâ€™t stay there.
Where to Stay in Sihanoukville Monkey Republic â€“ This hostel is awesome.
Itâ€™s a happening place with a bar restaurant and pool.
The staff is really friendly and they host a lot of events.
Say hi to Aaron for me! They can also organize a lot of day trips for you too.
Day 4 â€“ Sihanoukville Today is a day for day trips.
From Sihanoukville hop on a boat and take a 45-minute ride to Koh Rong.
While you can stay overnight if youâ€™re pressed for time you can do it in a day trip.
The beaches here are way better than on the mainland and a lot less polluted.
Snorkeling day trips cost approximately $21 USD and include lunch and equipment there are PADI-certified schools in the area that offer a variety of different dive trips for one or more days.
If you donâ€™t feel like heading to Koh Rong you could book motorbike trip into Bokor National Park as well as longer multiday trips if youâ€™re interested.
There you can hike through a great rainforest or see the atmospheric ruins of the French aristocracy for whom Bokor was a big draw back in the day.
Youâ€™ll have some amazing views and find ruins waterfalls and temples all around.
You could also do a day trip to Kampot and the pepper fields in that area too.
Day 5 â€“ Siem Reap Itâ€™s gonna be a busy travel day.
From Sihanoukville youâ€™ll need to return to Phnom Penh and then get on another bus to Siem Reap.
I recommend Capitol Tours.
Itâ€™s a 12-hour ride so itâ€™ll be evening by the time you get to Siem Reap.
Note Itâ€™s better to take the night bus so as not to waste a day.
You wonâ€™t sleep well but you also wonâ€™t lose a day! Siem Reap is located on the northeastern side of Tonle Sap Lake and is the main access to Angkor Wat.
The center remains a rural old town with French-style houses and shops.
The area around the Old Market is crowded with locals and foreigners all day long.
Where to Stay in Siem Reap Topsky Hostel â€“ This hostel offers basic accommodations in a pretty quiet area thatâ€™s not far from the action.
Try to get a lower bunk with a privacy curtain.
The friendly staff will help you arrange a tuk-tuk and activities too.
Day 6 â€“ Siem Reap Spend your day at Angkor Wat the ancient city that was the center of the Khmer Empire that once ruled most of Southeast Asia.
The temple was built in the 12th century and covers over 500 acres.
The most popular temples are Angkor Wat Bayon Ta Phrom and Angkor Thom.
I would recommend getting a multiday pass so you can visit some of the outer temples where there are fewer visitors.
You can hire a tuk-tuk for the day for around $20-25 USD or rent bicycles and explore on your own.
Angkor Wat is open daily from 5am to 6pm.
Admission is $37 USD per person for a day pass $62 USD for a three-day pass and $72 USD for a seven-day pass.
Day 7 â€“ Siem Reap Enjoy your last day in Cambodia by exploring more of the Siem Reap area.
Head over to the Angkor Wat complex for several more hours in the morning and then head over to astonishing Banteay Srei.
Known as the city of womenâ€? this temple was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and features a number of outstanding red sandstone statues.
You need an Angkor Wat Pass to visit.
If you have time visit Tonle Sap Southeast Asiaâ€™s largest freshwater lake.
It is 52km 32 miles from Siem Reap.
Sailing down the river and around the lake gives you a look at how closely Cambodian life is tied to this major waterway.
Tours start around $2.50 USD per person.
What to See and Do in Cambodia A Two-Week itinerary Want to spend more time in Cambodia? Great! You should! There are tons of other places to visit.
Here are my suggestions Days 1 & 2 â€“ Phnom Penh Follow the Phnom Penh itinerary from above.
Day 3 & 4 â€“ Sihanoukville Follow the Sihanoukville itinerary from above.
Day 5 & 6 â€“ Koh Rong Head out to Koh Rong which got its name after the legend of a giant King Kongâ€“like ape that once called the island home.
Itâ€™s a 45-minute trip from Sihanoukville and a great place to relax on the beach or go snorkeling.
There are a lot of accommodation options and itâ€™s a popular spot with backpackers.
Day trips costs around $25 USD and include lunch and snorkeling equipment but since you have the time spend a few nights here relaxing and enjoying beach life.
There are also other islands nearby if you want to stay longer and explore including Koh Rong Samloem which is becoming something of a backpacker paradise thereâ€™s even a Full Moon Party there now.
Days 7 & 8 â€“ Kep In the morning travel by bus to Kep which is about two hours from Sihanoukville.
This quaint beach town and fishing village is the quiet version of Sihanoukville a nice place to relax near the ocean but without a party atmosphere.
Itâ€™s famous for its pepper crab and empty beaches.
Consider taking two full days here.
Sure itâ€™s quite sleepy and thereâ€™s not a lot to do but itâ€™s the perfect place to relax eat all the delicious crabs the city is famous for and read a book.
You can also spend some time on nearby Rabbit Island Koh Tonsay too a secluded and charming escape from the world if youâ€™re looking to disconnect.
Basic bungalows can be rented for under $10 USD per night.
Where to Stay in Kep Khmer House Hostel â€“ Kep is pretty spread out so wherever you stay make sure you rent a bike or scooter.
This hostel is a good option as itâ€™s not far from the Crab Market.
Day 9 â€“ Kampot The southern region of Cambodia is filled with pepper farms where you can learn about the history of the spice see how it is grown and pick up what is considered some of the finest pepper in the world.
Iâ€™d spend one night in Kampot.
Itâ€™s another quiet town on the coast.
Most people come here to enjoy the scenic riverside views as well as the rolling hills that surround the city.
The area used to be a getaway for the French so youâ€™ll see old French architecture around.
At night the street near the old bridge is lined with fruit shake vendors.
Try a million.
The city is famous for them.
Also if you only do one thing in this entire itinerary make sure itâ€™s eating the ribs at The Rusty Keyhole.
They are some of the best ribs Iâ€™ve ever had in my entire life.
You have to order them the day before.
Youâ€™ll also get healthy side of mashed potatoes and coleslaw too.
Itâ€™s one of the best meals Iâ€™ve ever had.
I still dream of it.
Where to Stay in Kampot The Magic Sponge â€“ This is one of my favorite hostels in Cambodia.
Make sure you book early as it tends to sell out.
Itâ€™s a really nice relaxed guesthouse where youâ€™ll get your own bed not a bunk.
Youâ€™ll feel at home here and itâ€™s a short walk to the center of town.
The dorm rooms are very clean.
They also have a little mini-golf course too.
Day 10 â€“ Kampot Today hire hire a tuk-tuk driver to explore the Kampot area.
The Phnom Chhngok Cave Temple has a religious shrine inside or you can head out and spend the day in Bokor as Kampot is relatively close to the park.
Days 11 12 & 13 â€“ Siem Reap Follow the Siem Reap itinerary from above.
Angkor Wat is best seen slowly so use your days to explore it as much as possible.
There are a lot of out-of-the-way temples to visit that are free of crowds.
Day 14 â€“ Siem Reap On your last day in Cambodia why not take a cooking class? The class sizes tend to be around six people and you will learn to prepare three different meals as well as get recipe cards at the end.
Prices start around $20 USD per person local guesthouses can help arrange a class.
What to See and Do in Cambodia A Three-Week Itinerary Have even more time for Cambodia? Good! Cambodia has a lot more to it than the major spots on the backpacker trail.
Days 1 2 & 3 â€“ Phnom Penh and Kirirom National Park Follow the above suggestions but also head out to Kirirom National Park for a day trip.
This park has all sorts of walking trails mountain biking trails waterfalls and a few lakes.
Itâ€™s a good place to go to take a break from the city.
The park is around a two-hour drive from the city so youâ€™ll need to hire a driver for the day.
The best way to do this is to find some travelers to join you so you can share a ride which will cost around $80 for the day.
Days 4 5 6 7 & 8 â€“ Sihanoukville and the Islands Follow the above suggestions but at a much slower pace! Days 9 10 & 11 â€“ Kep and Rabbit Island Follow the above suggestions for Kep but head out to Rabbit Island for a rustic island getaway.
Days 12 & 13 â€“ Kampot Follow the above suggestions! Days 14 15 & 16 â€“ Siem Reap Follow the above suggestions! Day 17 â€“ Koh Ker For a fun day trip from Siem Reap head to Koh Ker located around 2.5 hours from town.
Koh Ker was briefly the capital of the Khmer Empire and many of the temples here are over 1000 years old.
Itâ€™s a massive archeological site located in the jungle and it sees far fewer tourists than Siem Reap.
There are no public buses that go there the roads were only paved a few years ago so youâ€™ll have to arrange transportation via your hostel or hotel.
Day 18 â€“ Phnom Kulen For another fun day trip head to Phnom Kulen considered the countryâ€™s most sacred mountain.
Itâ€™s located just 50km from Siem Reap and offers some amazing jungles hiking and picturesque waterfalls where you can take dip to beat the heat.
You can easily spend a day here.
If you head up to the summit there are some great views as well as a large reclining Buddha statue.
Try to arrive early as the park fills up by lunchtime.
Admission to the park is $20 USD.
Day 19 â€“ Battambang From Siem Reap you can take a three-hour bus to Battambang.
Or try taking a riverboat on Tonle Sap for a unique experience there is one boat per day with tickets costing around $20 USD per person.
When you arrive youâ€™ll discover Cambodia without the tourism.
Get familiar with Battambang by exploring the town on foot or by tuk-tuk.
Check out the Phsar Boeung Choeuk and Phsar Naht markets.
Youâ€™ll also want to visit the gorgeous pagodas and temples such as Wat Pippitharam near the Old Market Wat Bovil Wat Kandal and Wat Damreay Sar.
In the evening check out the Battambang Circus.
The show is put on by students at a Cambodian nonprofit arts school so your donations go to a good cause.
Where to Stay in Battambang Sophea Hostel â€“ This is a good place to meet locals and make some friends.
Itâ€™s family-run and they try to make you feel at home.
The facilities are pretty basic but typical dorms.
Thereâ€™s a nice garden and sitting area.
While thereâ€™s no restaurant on-site there are plenty of nearby options.
Day 20 â€“ Battambang Take it easy this morning by touring the town a bit more on foot.
Check out the colonial architecture along the waterfront and the governorâ€™s residence.
This building from the early 1900s is not open but you can marvel at the exterior.
While youâ€™re wandering donâ€™t miss the Art Deco central market building and the Victory swimming pool where you can take a dip if youâ€™re in the mood.
You may want to visit the Battambang Museum admission is just $1 USD and youâ€™ll learn a lot about the history of the area.
After lunch you should grab a tuk-tuk and head a bit out of town to check out Phnom Sampeu.
Take about an hour to climb to the monastery on the hill.
Youâ€™ll also find some caves in the area with Buddhist temples in them.
Thereâ€™s also another cave at the foot of Phnom Sampeu this is where you want to be around dusk when millions of bats fly out of the cave in search of food.
Itâ€™s an incredible sight! Day 21 â€“ Siem Reap or Phnom Penh Make your way back to one of these towns depending on where your flight is leaving from.
Enjoy the bus ride knowing itâ€™s your last in Cambodia at least for now! *** I always love my time in Cambodia.
It lacks the polish of Thailand making travel here a little more rustic and challenging.
But more amazing than any of the countryâ€™s sights and activities are the people.
Iâ€™ve always found them to be incredibly welcoming.
Even with so much darkness clouding their recent history Cambodians always go above and beyond making any trip here a memorable one.
But donâ€™t take my word for it.
Come and see this incredibly country for yourself.

Like you I really enjoyed Phnom Penh and would love to stay there for a few months or more.
Kampot is such a dreamy town beside the river and I enjoyed the cheap and cold Cambodian beer.
So good! Loved the Battambang circus also.
So many of the places youâ€™ve talked about weâ€™ve been and enjoyed.
Koh Ker and Phnom Kulen are the exceptions though and if or when we return to Cambodia theyâ€™ll be on our list.
Cambodia is one country where you just know you will have a bus story to tell! Reply Artur May 6 2019 at 1026 am Thank you for the interesting and useful article.
I have already been to Cambodia but I see that there is a reason to return there again.
I also liked the country very much although I think that it still needs a lot of time to recover from the tragic events of the past.
Reply George Fox-Edwards May 7 2019 at 1123 am Very handy itineraries and nice that you space them out to cover various timescales.
From my experience Iâ€™d suggest swapping out Sihanoukville for a day in Kampot and a day on either Koh Rong or Koh Rong Sanloem depending on how crazy you want your evening to be!.
Kampot was one of my favourite spots and Sihanoukville has indeed been overrun by big tourist hotel/casino blocks ð?™? Reply Hayley June 30 2019 at 931 pm Hi Matt! This article has been so helpful planning my itinerary traveling through Cambodia.
Thank you! Iâ€™ve seen a lot of travel blog mention that you donâ€™t need riel as everywhere takes USD.
I just wanted to pop in real quick and say that Iâ€™ve ran into multiple situations always outside of the city center where the locals do not take USD.
This has been in both Siem Reap and Battambang and has happened at both restaurants and markets.
Iâ€™ve also asked multiple Khmer people about which current to use and they said while most tourist places accept USA they would prefer if people used Riel because that is the official currency of Cambodia.
Reply Carol Henshaw January 29 2020 at 516 pm Our guide in 2008 did not know how old she was.
Her father a teacher & therefore an intellectual was killed by the Khmer Rouge Her mother died of starvation and she was brought up by an older woman in the village.
In the Killing Fields we were walking over ground with scraps of fabric sticking out an indication you are walking over mass graves.
The rest of the country was beautiful and very interesting.
