Growing up Budapest seemed like this historic yet mysterious place closed off by the Soviets but filled with historic grandeur.
When I first visited the gritty rundown streets charmed me.
Budapest felt edgy in sharp contrast to say Pragueâ€™s more sanitized history.
IT was a city of underground bars in abandoned buildings hearty food and serious people.
Over the years Iâ€™ve seen the city change as the tourists visit in droves.
And while no longer as edgy those ruin bars are no longer hidden Budapest is still something else.
It offers some of the best nightlife in Europe tons of spas and hot springs stunning historic buildings and museums and lots of green space.
Budapest is a city with layers.
No matter what youâ€™re interested in youâ€™ll be able to find it here.
To help you make the most out of your next trip here are my top 24 things to see and do in Budapest.
1.
Take a Free Walking Tour Whenever I arrive in a new destination I always take a free walking tour.
Itâ€™s a budget-friendly way to see the main sights learn about the destination and ask any questions you have to a local expert.
Theyâ€™re a quick and easy way to get an overview of a city which will help you plan the rest of your trip.
Budapest has a number of good free tours available.
Here are a few you can check out to get started Strawberry Tours Trip to Budapest Generation Tours 2.
Soak at the Baths Budapest is known for its thermal spa baths itâ€™s one of the best things about this city.
Youâ€™ll find more than 100 mineral hot springs here many dating back to the Roman Empire.
The most popular is the SzÃ©chenyi Baths in City Park.
With 18 pools itâ€™s the largest and most famous in Europe.
The historic buildings that house the spa were built in 1913 and itâ€™s a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.
Donâ€™t forget your bathing suit and flip-flops you can rent towels and lockers.
Ã?llatkerti krt.

Open daily 6am-10pm.
Admission starts at 4900 HUF.
3.
Ruin Bars The nightlife in Budapest is one of the best in Europe â€” and ruin bars are a big reason why.
Located in the old Jewish Quarter much of the neighborhood was left to decay after World War II.
During the 90s bars began to appear in the abandoned buildings in the area.
Now this underground scene is well on the map.
But that doesnâ€™t make this eclectic arty and funky spaces any less fun.
Szimpla Kert Instant and FogashÃ¡z are my three favorites but for a more detailed list of whatâ€™s hot right now check out my post on the best ruin bars in Budapest! 4.
Castle Hill This historic area is home to baroque houses and Habsburg monuments.
Cobblestone streets and narrow alleys that hark back to the cityâ€™s medieval roots parallel panoramic views of Pest and the Danube.
This section of the city is actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site with the Old Town in the north and the massive palace to the south which dates to the 13th century.
6.
Buda Castle In the Castle Hill area youâ€™ll also find Buda Castle itâ€™s more of a palace complex than anything else.
The original complex was constructed in the 13th century however the huge Baroque palace that exists today was actually built between 1749-1769.
Originally intended for the nobility the palace was looted by the Nazis and then the Soviets during World War II.
Fun fact Beneath the castle Vlad the Impaler colloquially known as Count Dracula was imprisoned for 14 years.
In the dungeon area there is also a labyrinth that tourists used to be able to explore â€” in the dark no less â€” though itâ€™s now closed.
Youâ€™ll also find some museums here as well see below.
Szent GyÃ¶rgy tÃ©r 2 +36 1 458 3000 budacastlebudapest.com.
The courtyards are open 24/7 while the castle is open daily from 10am-8pm.
5.
Hospital in the Rock This museum served as a hospital bomb shelter prison and nuclear bunker.
Here youâ€™ll learn about the impacts that World War II the 1956 revolution and the Cold War had on the city and its people.
Opened in 2008 itâ€™s one of the most popular attractions in town.
Admission includes a one-hour guided tour of the museums which has all sorts of wax figures tools equipment and furnishings.

Admission is 4000 HUF.
6.
Hungarian National Gallery Opened in 1957 this museum focuses on Hungarian artists and history of which I knew very little before my first visit.
The gallery is located in Buda Castle home to paintings and sculptures from the renaissance and middle ages including wooden altarpieces from the 1400s.
You can also tour the buildingâ€™s massive dome.
The gallery hosts rotating temporary exhibits too so check the website to find out whatâ€™s on during your visit.

7.
Budapest History Museum This museum covers four floors of Buda Castle and provides a comprehensive overview of the cityâ€™s entire history.
Itâ€™s a must for anyone looking to get a more detailed look at the cityâ€™s 2000-year past.
My favorite exhibit was the 1000 Years of Budapestâ€? display.
Be sure to get the audio guide as it provides a lot of good supplemental information.
Itâ€™s worth the cost.

8.
The Cave Church In the 1920s Catholic monks built this church in a large cave system that had been previously used by a hermit monk.
Known as Saint Ivanâ€™s Cave the cave was used as a hospital during World War II.
When the communists came to power after the war they covered the entrance in concrete and executed the head monk.
In 1989 as the Iron Curtain fell the church was reopened and is now a popular place for tourists as well as a place of worship for locals.
Get the audio guide to make the most out of your visit.
There is a lot of history here.

Open Monday-Saturday 930am-730pm.
Admission is 600 HUF.
9.
Matthias Church This neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church is one of the most unique churches in Europe.
Iâ€™ve literally seen hundreds of churches and cathedrals across the continent and this is one of the most original.
The original church in this spot was built in the 11th century though nothing remains of it the current building was constructed in the 14th century and was heavily renovated in the 19th century.
During the Turkish invasion of the 16th century it was converted to a mosque which is why its vibrant colors and designs that arenâ€™t common in European churches the church has a colorful roof that almost makes it look like it was built from Lego.
Once inside youâ€™ll see the huge vaulted ceilings and ornate dÃ©cor.
SzenthÃ¡romsÃ¡g tÃ©r 2 +36 1 355 5657 matyas-templom.hu.
Open 9am-5pm on weekdays 9am-1pm on Saturdays and 1pm-5pm on Sundays.
Admission is 1800 HUF.
Guided tours are available for 2500 HUF.
10.
Fishermanâ€™s Bastion Built between 1895 and 1902 this terrace is comprised of seven towers that look out over the river.
Each one is meant to represent one of the seven Hungarian tribes that founded the city.
The terrace was designed by the same architect who created the Matthias Church and provides stunning panoramic views across the Danube River.
Competing legends say that the name comes from either the fact that the terrace overlooks the old fishermenâ€™s guild or that the fishermenâ€™s guild was responsible for protecting that area of the wall.
No one is quite certain which is right.
SzenthÃ¡romsÃ¡g tÃ©r +36 1 458 3030 fishermansbastion.com.
Open daily 9am-11pm.
Admission is free with an additional charge of 1000 HUF to visit the upper turrets.
11.
Hungarian Presidential Palace The Hungarian Presidental Palace has been the workplace of the president since 2003.
Known as SÃ¡ndor-palota Alexander Palace itâ€™s not nearly as impressive as the surrounding buildings but if you time your visit right you can see the changing of the guard ceremony at the top of each hour from 9am-5pm excluding Sundays.
Sometimes the palace will be open for tours but this rarely happens so donâ€™t get your hopes up.
Szent GyÃ¶rgy tÃ©r 1-2 +36 1 224 5000.
Admission to the changing of the guard is free.
12.
Buda Tower This reconstructed towerâ€? is all that remains of the Church of Mary Magdalene which was originally built in the 13th century but was destroyed during World War II.
When the Turks occupied the city between 1541-1699 the church was converted into a mosque.
It reopened in 2017 and you can now climb the 172 steps that lead to the top.
That said the views from Castle Hill are just as good â€” and free â€” so Iâ€™d skip climbing the steps and just admire this historic tower from the outside.
KapisztrÃ¡n tÃ©r 6 budatower.hu/en.
Open daily 10am-6pm but only on the weekends in January and February.
Admission is 1500 HUF.
13.
Walk Across the Chain Bridge The SzÃ©chenyi Chain Bridge connects Buda with Pest and is a wrought-iron and stone suspension bridge.
The bridge originally opened in 1849 but was damaged during World War II and had to be rebuilt.
Spend some time strolling across the bridge and taking in the view.
Donâ€™t miss Gresham Palace located on the Pest side.
Itâ€™s an Art Nouveau building that is now a luxurious Four Seasons hotel.
14.
Visit Parliament Built in 1902 this is the largest building in the country and home to the national assembly.
This massive structure â€” which covers over 18000 square meters â€” took almost 20 years to build.
You can take guided tours of the building where you can learn about the history of the city and how the government of the country works.
If you plan to visit purchase your tickets in advance as the lines can get quite long.
Kossuth Lajos tÃ©r 1-3 +36 1 441 4000 parlament.hu.
Open daily 8am-6pm.
Admission is 6000 HUF.
15.
Stroll Along the Danube After visiting Parliament take a walk along the river.
Head south to check out the promenade and its many green spaces and sculptures including the sobering Shoes on the Danube Bankâ€? a memorial honoring the Jews who were shot here during World War II.
If you have a book or just want to take in the view this is a reflective place to stop and relax.
16.
Great Market Hall This is the oldest and largest indoor market in the country.
Built in 1897 youâ€™ll find mostly produce meats baked goods and candy on the ground floor while the upper floor is home to restaurants and souvenir shops.
It has a lot of traditional places to eat so be sure to walk around and explore first.
Yes itâ€™s touristy itâ€™s the central market after all but I still found the food quite good and affordable.
Even if you donâ€™t plan on buying anything itâ€™s still worth a quick visit to walk around.
VÃ¡mhÃ¡z kÃ¶rÃºt 1â€“3.
Open Monday 6am-5pm Tuesday-Friday 6am-6pm  and Saturday 6am-3pm.

20.
The Museum of Terror Life in Budapest under the fascist and communist regimes was brutal.
The building that houses this museum was used by the Ã?VH Secret Police and Arrow Cross Party the Hungarian Nazi party during their reigns of terror.
Over 700000 Hungarians were killed or imprisoned by the Soviets and the museum does an excellent and moving job of highlighting just how terrible their daily lives were.
The museumâ€™s permanent exhibits are spread over four floors and house all sorts of propaganda weapons and informative multimedia displays.
