Italy is basically a confederation of different regional countries and cultures.â€? Because thereâ€™s so much to see and do in Italy and not everyone has a lot of time many travelers decide to take tours when they visit Italy.
Iâ€™ve done Italy on my own and with tour companies.

Like way way way too many.
It can be very overwhelming deciding which Italy tour company to pick.
