Iâ€™d wanted to visit Colombia for years.
And after spending six weeks there I must say it lived up to the hype.
I mean Iâ€™ve been fawning over it a lot in my last few posts.
And I know Iâ€™m the millionth blogger to do so but it really is as incredible as people say.
Even getting knifed there couldnâ€™t stop me from loving the country.
I had falsely assumed that six weeks would be enough to get a good sense of Colombia.
After all six weeks is a fair amount of time to spend anywhere.
But I was wrong.
Given its size and the sheer number of activities it was barely enough to scratch the surface.
Yet I did manage to see a lot.
Today I want to share my list of what I think are the best things to see and do in Colombia.
These are the activities and places you should try to focus on when you visit 1.
Cartagena Cartagena is one of the most visited destinations in Colombia thanks to a lot of direct flights and cruise ship visits.
Dating back to 1533 the city is famed for its colonial Old Town a maze of cobbled alleys flower-covered balconies and giant churches on spacious plazas.
But despite the crowds and there are a lot of crowds I really enjoyed Cartagena.
While there arenâ€™t a lot of tourist activities you can do most of them in a single day what makes it a wonderful place to visit is just that itâ€™s somewhere you can slow down relax and gorge on the phenomenal gastronomy.
For more check out this blog post about Cartegena and all my favorite places to eat there.
2.
Tayrona National Park Located on Colombiaâ€™s Caribbean coast Tayrona has long stretches of golden beaches lined with coconut palms and a dense rainforest with lots of easy day hikes.
Youâ€™ll also find campsites for overnight stays hammocks for rent restaurants diving and horse riding.
Itâ€™s easy to visit as a day trip from Santa Marta.
I highly suggest you start early at the big entrance at El Zaino and exit the park through Calabazo.
This underused route takes a whole day and once you pass the Cabo San Juan campground youâ€™ll get the last half of the trail to yourself.
Try to avoid visiting during January and weekends when the crowds on the beaches and hiking paths are at their peak.
3.
The Lost City La Ciudad Perdida The Lost City was built around 800 CE and contains 169 terraces carved into the mountains as well as a network of tiled roads and small plazas.
Itâ€™s one of the most beautiful treks in the country and the site is older than Machu Picchu! To visit you need to hire a tour operator you canâ€™t do it by yourself.
Itâ€™s about $300-350 USD for the trek from Santa Marta through the jungle up to these beautiful ruins and takes 4â€“6 days.
If youâ€™re pressed for time you can also do it in three days the only difference is the pace you go at.
Tip You cross a lot of rivers so be sure to bring an extra pair of shoes or flip flops for when you cross the rivers.
Youâ€™ll easily ruin a pair of sneakers along the way.
4.
Salento Surrounded by green mountains and coffee farms this is one of the oldest towns in the coffee-growing region and the most popular for travelers.
The houses are painted a variety of vibrant colors and the high vantage points throughout town provide some stunning views sunsets are quite magical.
Thereâ€™s not much to do in the city itself â€” itâ€™s simply a base for coffee tours or hiking the Cocora Valley see below or the trails around town â€” so itâ€™s easy to spend a few days here watching the world go by with a good book in hand.
5.
Cocora Valley The Cocora Valley is home to Colombiaâ€™s national tree the wax palm which grows to nearly 200 feet tall.
This area has probably the most popular day hike in the country which was also my favorite activity during my entire trip.
Youâ€™ll cross jungle rivers visit a bird sanctuary and enjoy some stellar views and forest scenery.
The routeâ€™s about five hours and you can choose to either take the clockwise or counterclockwise route.
The clockwise route starting at the Wax Palm Valley is easier with fewer hills.
Counterclockwise is easier at the end though a little anticlimactic as you end the hike walking down a boring road.
Tip Start early to avoid the brutal midday heat since there are a lot of exposed areas here.
6.
BogotÃ¡ BogotÃ¡ is Colombiaâ€™s vibrant capital.
While itâ€™s not the countryâ€™s most popular destination it felt the most Colombianâ€? to me there was just a certain edge and charm to it and it seemed the least touristy with the fewest gringo expats.
The historic downtown La Candelaria is filled with bright colonial buildings detailed museums delicious restaurants tiny fun bars historic churches and centuries-old houses.
The north end of town is home to boutique hotels and entertainment areas like Zona Rosa and Zona G.
The foodie scene in the city is incredible with a lot of international options and cutting-edge gastronomic happenings.
Throw in some amazing walking tours day trips and hikes and youâ€™ve got a recipe for an astounding city.
For more hereâ€™s a list of all my favorite things to do â€“ and places to eat â€“ in Bogota.
7.
Cali This hot hot city is the salsa capital of the world where people come to dance.
A lot of the guests at my hostel had been there for weeks to learn the hostels also offer free dance classes.
If you like to dance you canâ€™t miss this city.
Besides dancing though there are a number of parks museums and churches you can visit plus free walking and food tours.
While I didnâ€™t stay long I definitely enjoyed the scene.
8.
PopayÃ¡n PopayÃ¡n rivals Cartagena as Colombiaâ€™s most impressive colonial town.
Itâ€™s known as La Ciudad Blanca The White Cityâ€? because all the buildings are painted white.
PopayÃ¡n is also a college town there are three universities and itâ€™s produced 17 presidents too! Though small I really loved the slow pace of life and the surprisingly robust food scene here eat at La Cosecha Parrillada Restaurante Italiano y Pizzeria La Fresa and Mora de Castilla.
While you donâ€™t need a lot of time take the walking tour climb the hill see the churches and youâ€™re done I do suggest staying longer to enjoy the slow pace of life.
So much of Colombia is go-go-go itâ€™s nice to find a place thatâ€™s more stay and relax a while.â€? 9.
Tatacoa Desert Millions of years ago it was once a lush tropical forest.
Now Tatacoa Desert is filled with rocky canyons in shades of red and gray.
It is also home to one of the most important observatories in South America where you can gaze at the stars weather permitting.
If you want to be blown away by the universe you really need to see this place! Other than that thereâ€™s not much here.
Bike into the desert take some walks stare at the sky.
Stay a night or two.
Itâ€™s not a popular area but it is a picturesque way to break up the long bus ride from BogotÃ¡ to the south or vice versa.
10.
San AgustÃ­n Archaeological Park A UNESCO World Heritage Site San AgustÃ­n is a small mountain town thatâ€™s home to hundreds of pre-Columbian statues and burial mounds.
Its collection of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures is the largest in Latin America for which youâ€™ll need at least one full day two to really see it all in depth.
If you love history this is probably the best spot in all of Colombia to experience it.
11.
San Gil San Gil is considered the outdoors capital of the country.
Extreme-sports fans love it here.
You can go white-water rafting paragliding caving rappelling trekking and more from this city! This city is a great place to do outdoor activities and youâ€™re going to find a lot of tour operators in the city.
Try to plan at least three days here.
Itâ€™s worth it.
12.
Providencia and San AndrÃ©s Islands These islands are actually closer to Nicaragua than Colombia.
They are also considered some of the most unspoiled places in the Caribbean.
Youâ€™ll find white-sand beaches stunningly clear blue water and few crowds though thanks to some recent press Providencia is becoming a lot busier.
Try to make it when tens of thousands of black crabs migrate to the sea.
This happens twice a year for about a 1-2-week period between April and July so itâ€™s not always easy to nail the timing.
13.
MedellÃ­n In a country full of hype this hyped-up city is all that itâ€™s cracked up to be.
Set in the AburrÃ¡ Valley MedellÃ­n is one of the fastest-growing cities in Colombia.
It has enough activities and things to do to fill weeks on end from microbreweries museums walking tours spacious parks street art food tours and markets to incredible nightlife and on and on and on.
Itâ€™s one of the most popular destinations for expats and tourists in the country.
While itâ€™s easy to get lost in Gringoland here try to get out of Poblado or Laureles and see the localsâ€™ side of town.
Thereâ€™s more to the city than those two areas! 14.
GuatapÃ© This pueblo is one of the most picturesque towns in Colombia and one of the most colorful in the world as most of the traditional homes have murals painted on the bottom half of their faÃ§ades that depict animals people and shapes.
Just hanging out in one of the bright plazas drinking coffee and people-watching is one of the most pleasant things to do here.
Most people though come to climb the steep and difficult staircase to the top of the monolithic Rock of GuatapÃ© La Piedra for some of the best views in the country.
GuatapÃ© is a long day trip from MedellÃ­n hostels in the city organize them throughout the week so I recommend trying to spend at least a night here so you arenâ€™t as rushed and can enjoy the area little more.
15.
Chingaza National Park This is one of the biggest nature reserves in Colombia home to more than 1000 plant species and 187 bird species.
Here youâ€™ll learn about the PÃ¡ramo ecosystem and how it affects the global water system.
Fun fact Nearly 80% of BogotÃ¡â€™s water supply comes from Chingaza.
If youâ€™re going to hike joining a tour is a good idea.
The guides are usually naturalists who can explain the unique environment of the area.
One of the best routes is the challenging hike to the summit of Lagunas de Siecha with a great view over the lakes.
16.
Barranquilla Located between Santa Marta and Cartagena Barranquilla is the spot to be during Carnival the second biggest in Latin America.
It starts on a Sunday with the Battle of Flowers a big parade and the coronation of the King and Queen.
But thereâ€™s a lot to do here when itâ€™s not carnival season as well.
Make sure you visit El Museo del Caribe a museum offering an interesting insight into the history of Colombiaâ€™s Caribbean coast.
Thereâ€™s also a special exhibit dedicated to Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez the famous author who wrote Love in the Time of Cholera.
17.
Tierradentro Tierradentro is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America.
Itâ€™s up there with San AgustÃ­n but gets less press since itâ€™s located in the middle of nowhere and not on a main road.
It contains over 100 hypogea underground tombs dating from the sixth to the tenth centuries the only examples of their kind in the Americas.
It takes a day or two to hike all the paths around the tombs.
You can hire a guide if you want but the trails are pretty easy to do on your own.
18.
Manizales and Los Nevados On the road from MedellÃ­n to the south is the city of Manizales.
Here you can take some tours at this northern point of the coffee-growing region or roam around town which has some decent restaurants and churches and a scenic gondola ride.
The main reason people visit is to hike Los Nevados a mountain range with majestic snow-capped peaks.
You can do a day or multi-day hikes but whatever you do donâ€™t rush up to the top â€” acclimatize yourself to the altitude in Manizales for a few days first.
The town is 2000 meters 6500 feet above sea level but mountains are about 6000 meters 19700 feet! I wasnâ€™t climatized and could really feel the altitude just walking around town.
Donâ€™t push yourself if you want to do the hike.
19.
The Caribbean Coast The beaches on the Caribbean coast might not win any awards at least in my opinion but the sleepy towns reminded me a lot of the tiny backpacker beach villages around Southeast Asia a dirt road lots of hostels a relaxed atmosphere and not much else to do.
I could easily see why people end up getting stuck here for weeks at a time.
The best beach towns to visit are CosteÃ±o Beach and Palomino.
20.
Punta Gallinas Punta Gallinas is the northernmost point in all of South America.
Most people come here via a tour from Santa Marta or Cabo de Vela with the latter through La Guajira Desert being the better option if you just want to take your time and relax because itâ€™s closer so thereâ€™s a lot less drive time.
In fact the only way to see the area is via a tour.
Most are two or three nights depending on where youâ€™re coming from.
Any hostel can organize a trip for you.
21.
Minca Minca is located in the foothills of the Sierra de Santa Marta Mountains.
Once a sleepy backpacker town itâ€™s now a hot spot for tourists escaping the oppressive heat on the Caribbean coast and hoping to do some quiet hikes.
One of the best hikes is to Los Pinos but it isnâ€™t easy it takes about three hours from the center of town and itâ€™s a steady climb into the mountains but like all things like this itâ€™s worth it.
There are a lot of waterfalls in the area as well.
Two of the best are the Pozo Azul and Marinka.
Both have swimming holes at them too.
Be sure to check out the sunset Mundo Nuevo Hostel.
Itâ€™s an amazing vantage point.
*** Colombia has a million and one things to do.
I lost track of all the places I kept wishing I had time to visit.
You can spend months there and a lot of people to do.
However I think this list is a great start.
My recommendation is that if youâ€™re short on time fly the bus rides are long or just stick to one area of the country and go in depth around that region.
Trying to see it allâ€? in Colombia is just a recipe for burnout! Book Your Trip to Colombia Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld.
If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
I use them all the time.

With kids weâ€™re considering spending more time relaxing in Guatape and exploring the waterfalls in San Rafael and not staying long in Medellin.
Weâ€™re smaller town type people but will we regret not spending more time in Medellin?? Thanks for all of the info!! Reply Marissa Spiegel August 20 2019 at 1116 pm The mountains near Manizales arenâ€™t that hight.
The highest mountain in the Cordillera Central is just over 17600 feet hight but thatâ€™s near CalÃ­.
Nevado del Ruiz near Manizales is just under 17500.
