Travel improves our lives broadens our horizons and helps us understand the world we inhabit.
Yet these are experiences few humans will ever have.
As widespread as it has become in recent years travel is still a privilege afforded only to a few.
That is especially true of war zones where residents are more concerned about living through the day than seeing the wonders of the world.
Things we take for granted â€” the ability to turn on a tap and get drinkable water to flick a switch and get light to walk to the store and find food on the shelves â€” are rare or absent for those suffering through such conflicts.
While there many places in the world that are like that today I want to talk about one in particular Syria.
Lately Iâ€™ve seen a number of folks visit Syria as tourists.
When asked why they usually talk about trying to highlight the good people in the country and how such places arenâ€™t just what you see in the media.â€? And while both of those things are almost always true I donâ€™t think one should visit conflict zones as a tourist â€” whether youâ€™re a writer blogger or everyday Joe or Jane.
I think itâ€™s reckless and shows a complete lack of empathy and respect for the people suffering through the horrors of war.
Itâ€™s self-centered.
It doesnâ€™t actually help in any real way.
It usually creates a distorted picture of the situation.
Itâ€™s a misuse of Western privilege.
No one doubts there are wonderful people and places in Syria.
In fact one of my greatest travel regrets is not having visited Syria before the conflict because friends waxed poetic about how the hospitality and openness of the locals were second to none.
And the media is always more doom and gloomâ€? than the reality on the ground.
But that doesnâ€™t change the fact that there is a continuing war going on in Syria where millions continue to be displaced and dying.
While bloggers or tourists are there taking pictures hundreds of thousands are freezing.
The country has been in a civil war for close to nine years.
Over 400000 civilians have been killed some estimates put that number as high as 585000.
Thatâ€™s more than the entire population of places such as Iceland Belize the Bahamas or Malta.
On top of that over 13 million people have been displaced â€” with half of those being forced to leave the country entirely.
And many can never return due to retaliation from government forces against them or their families.
And almost half of the schools in the country have been affected with one in three children unable to attend.
And while ISIS has been pushed back they still have control of some areas and thanks to Trump there is also now an influx of both Turkish and Russian troops.
And thatâ€™s only causing more chaos.
As millions suffer through ongoing war chemical attacks and displacement visiting as a tourist and having a fun time is a horrifying idea to me.
It makes those who go seem more concerned with their ego than the plight of the country.
Well I just really want to see the country so fuck those who are suffering!â€? War zones are not tourist attractions.
Bombed buildings that used to be filled with life are not backdrops for Instagram shots.
While millions suffer and die just hours away or are displaced and cannot return home bloggers or tourists shouldnâ€™t be frolicking in the places where they used to live and laugh and spend time with their children snapping pictures and having fun while giving lip service about how itâ€™s sad to see what is happening to the country.
That to me seems like a major disconnect.
If someone wants to go there and report as a journalist to educate the world and try to mobilize action to stop the conflict thatâ€™s one thing.
But Iâ€™ve yet to see one person who wasnâ€™t an actual journalist from the mainstream news media do that.
Instead I hear talk about how complicatedâ€? the situation is how things are being rebuilt and how everyone is happy and things are safe whitewashing the war crimes of President Assad.
If you follow these accounts you get the impression the worst is behind the country.
Itâ€™s not.
And the fighting in Idlib is getting incredibly worse with children being greatly affected.
But thatâ€™s because these bloggers are a in government-controlled territory and b likely talking to Assad supporters or those too afraid to speak out.
Then thereâ€™s willful ignorance.
Take the example of Drew Binsky.
Iâ€™ve never met him though I do enjoy his videos.
And Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s a well-intentioned guy.
But he went to Syria and when challenged about this for the same reasons Iâ€™m bringing up said and I quote I know that Syria has been in a constant state of war for nearly a decade and I choose not to make that a focus.
Why? Itâ€™s a lose-lose for me because A itâ€™s a touchy subject and B I donâ€™t know much about the war and politics in general.
In fact I canâ€™t even tell you a thing about American politics cuz I donâ€™t really care! Iâ€™ve spent the last 8 years on the road and Iâ€™ve purposely separated myself from any politics because I choose to spend my time doing other things that make me happy.
I guess the bottom line here is that more eyeballs on my videos means more haters and we all know that haters are gonna hate! Apparently people who bring up the notion that maybe going to a war zone is not a good idea are haters.
And here he admits to not knowing much about the war or caring too much about the subject.
How can you visit a country torn by war and not want to learn more about it? How can you have a platform and seek to educate people and not talk about the conflict? Itâ€™s a pretty important thing! And heâ€™s not the only one who has done this just the most well known.
There have been many others.
It would be hard to link to them all but they are easy to find via a Google or Instagram search.
I think trips like these to war zones or repressive regimes are further examples of the lack of ethics in the online travel industry as well as look at meâ€? vs.
learn from meâ€? writing that puts the reader second to the influencerâ€™s own ego.
Rather than using this visit as a teachable moment to expand peopleâ€™s knowledge educate and talk about a dire situation they visit without thinking about that deeper impact.
But against the backdrop of war egos must wait.
A visit to government-controlled territory during an ongoing conflict is simply playing into the propaganda that says that the news is exaggerating the plight of the people.
What gassing by the Assad regime? What war crimes? What factionalism? Thereâ€™s nothing to see here right? Many of the Syrians I spoke to had even fewer kind words for those who go there.
They talked of those who visit now as taking joy in othersâ€™ miseryâ€? whitewashing Assadâ€™s crimes and Western privilege.
This quote from Zaina Erhaim an exiled Syrian journalist sums up what I heard from Syrians I spoke with Besides the active war going on and tens of civilians being killed on a daily basis beside whitewashing Assad as someone who has brought life and security back using their privileged background to get released if stopped at checkpoints above all that to cross to our home where half of us are forbidden from going to as we are forced into displacement and in exile to walk above our memories and wounds in order to get some extra views is inhuman.
Their blogs step on our trauma as they take smiling pictures in our streets with our destroyed homes and favorite restaurants in the background while we are prevented from going back to because we simply did our work and protested for basic rights.
*** I think travel boycotts are dumb.
People are not their governments.
But when war is happening and millions are dying and displaced our desire to travel must wait.
When Syria and these other countries are done fighting and need to be rebuilt tourism dollars are a wonderful way to help make that happen.
Take Afghanistan or Iraq.
While turmoil still exists there these countries are trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild.
There are new governments and the society is trying to move past the conflict.
Thereâ€™s a functioning economy and civil society.
Now is the time to visit those places.
But Syria? There is still an active conflict with other nations rolling tanks through part of the country.
Turkey and Russia are in conflict there and Israel recently sent missiles into Damascus.
Wait until the conflict is over people arenâ€™t dying and starving in the streets and there is hopefully some sort of brokered truce or long-lasting cease-fire.
Thatâ€™s when people will need our tourism dollars.
If you want to help those in Syria lobby governments to try to find a way to end the conflict.
Give to aid organizations like these Tight Knit Syria Doctors Without Borders International Rescue Committee Basmeh Zeitooneh Save the Children Islamic Relief USA Tahirih Justice Center Project Amal ou Salem But donâ€™t go visit.
Donâ€™t give Assad his propaganda wins.
Donâ€™t make people think everything is fine and the world should move on.
Donâ€™t go to a place where so much suffering is going on just because you want to see it.
Itâ€™s just the wrong thing to do.
Travel enriches the mind and expands the soul.
But it loses its charm when a place that is still shattered like glass and those around you are mired in a conflict without end.

It is similar with the sponsored trips taking place in North Korea maybe 2-3 years ago and Saudi Arabia recently.
It just speaks of seeking views and engagement not respect understanding or education.
Glad to see someone speak out about this! Reply Agnes February 27 2020 at 1255 pm Haters are gonna hate????â€? I am dumbstruck truly.
Reply Winston Smith February 27 2020 at 145 pm I canâ€™t stand these moralistic opinion pieces.
You donâ€™t want to go to Syria thatâ€™s entirely ok but others are free to make their own choices and deal with the morality of it without shamingâ€?.
To then go on and recommend Iraq and Afghanistan as viable tourist destinations seems absurd or perhaps thatâ€™s because America has sanitizedâ€? the latter but didnâ€™t manage it with the former? Reply Suzana February 27 2020 at 311 pm While I see your point I do believe that if people want to go to see first hand what is going on maybe to in fact experience the pain for themselves understand better they should be entitled to do so.
Iâ€™m not a blogger or a journalist Iâ€™m a digital nomad working remotely and personally I wouldnâ€™t choose that but others might.
There are many ways and many reasons to travel.
Some want to take the risk let them.
I love your pieces but this one is a bit judgmental.
Besides even in the middle of a storm there are day to day lives happening.
In the middle of a war people help each other.
If someone wants to go there and report on a few good things and ignore the bad maybe the world needs more of that.
Reply Anna February 27 2020 at 500 pm Thank you for sharing this! I had to stop following Drew a couple years ago after he blew off a similar critique about visiting North Korea.
Itâ€™s good to see travel bloggers like you who are responsible about where they go.
Reply Kat February 28 2020 at 214 am I stopped following him a few years back when he proclaimed Egypt didnâ€™t seem safe on his one night stay in the country just to get that passport stamp and stand on a poor camelâ€™s back.
Reply Eric February 28 2020 at 200 am Thank you for writing this Matt.
As long-term travelers considering the politics and ethics of where we go is crucial to protecting our reputation in the world.
I think a lot of content creators are drawn to the clicks that visiting a controversial location will contribute to their blogs or Youtube channel but youâ€™re right â€” just because someone doesnâ€™t show the broken glass in their video doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t there.
As tourists and travelers our dollars have power.
As a community we need to make sure weâ€™re using our cash to support countries that care for their people not regimes.
Reply Lannie February 28 2020 at 205 am As an aid worker in Afghanistan yes.
Just yes.
Reply Riana Ang-Canning February 29 2020 at 529 am Thank you so much for writing this! I follow one travel blogger on Instagram who was in Syria recently and the impression I got was that everything is fine they are open for tourists itâ€™s safe etc.
And that is such a distorted reality of the country and completing ignoring the on-going conflict.
I was disgusted reading Drewâ€™s comment above.
What a horrifically privileged and ignorant thing to say! To not care about politics isnâ€™t a cool decision itâ€™s a privilege.
Many people canâ€™t ignore politics because it affects their daily life.
Thank you for this post for speaking your truth and standing up to this.
Itâ€™s so important to have another voice in this conversation.
Reply Kara February 29 2020 at 1126 pm Wow! I love how you just put a little dig in about Russian and Turkish troops being present because of Trump but you just leave out the part that without Obamaâ€™s Iran Deal there wouldnâ€™t even be an ISIS! If you are going to talk politics and link to news articles it would be awesome if you actually linked to an objective news source instead of one that is openly left or right.
As a longtime reader I am pretty disappointed by this article even if you make a few good points.
Reply Paul March 5 2020 at 1006 am There are a lot of reasons why ISIS came into being but that Obamaâ€™s Iran Deal was one of them is rather absurd.
I challenge you to draw a straight line between the two.
Even people who are vehemently opposed to that deal canâ€™t do it Reply Morris Murphy March 1 2020 at 1151 am Thank you for sharing this! I tjink I gave have a break in following Drew a couple of years ago after he blew off a similar critique about visiting North Korea.
Itâ€™s good to see travel bloggers like you who are responsible about where they go.
Once again thank you for this publication keep it up Reply Adam LaPlate March 1 2020 at 511 pm This is probably one of my favorite travel articles recently.
I do think it is good to know and remember that not all of these disturbed countries are â€˜badâ€™ like you said we know good people are there.
But to simply treat it like a zoo and just watch while living lavishly behind the scenes seems disrespectful.
I have seen some influences and media peoples going over and visitingâ€? but only to promote action for their fundraiser or for support actions.
Thank you for bringing this to light you have many more visitors to this page than I could simply impact by my own rambling word of mouth.
Reply Jackie March 4 2020 at 114 pm The zoo analogy is perfect.
Reply Kendrick March 1 2020 at 601 pm I usually enjoy your blog post and Iâ€™m even part of your Superstar Blogging online course.
But Iâ€™d have to disagree with this finger-wagging article.
If people want to travel to the safe parts of Syria like Damascus then thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that.
Enjoy the country and meet the friendly locals while avoiding politics.
I used to dislike Drew Binskeyâ€™s contents as well but his new ones have been awesome.
Iâ€™m now a regular follower just in 2019.
His adventures to many nations that youâ€™d discourage people from travelling to were eye-opening like Somalia Libya Afghanistan South Sudan Central African Republic etc.
At the very least I admire his bravery for travelling to these nations.
Reply Kevin March 2 2020 at 1254 am There is no avoiding politicsâ€? â€” not in travel and not in anything else.
Actions are political and choosing to make a profit off the tragic events of a war-torn country is low.
Itâ€™s unethical and unprofessional â€” especially if you have no clue what is happening in the country.
Reply Valerie March 4 2020 at 1126 am Excellent article.
Itâ€™s given me a perspective I havenâ€™t thought about.
Itâ€™s so important to maintain empathy and respect for the people living there and suffering understanding how it feels from their point of view to see tourists who can leave the hell-hole and go back to their safe countries while they have no way out.
These tourists may be well-intentioned but are not understanding how it is perceived by the very people they may be wanting to help.
That intentional curiosity to find out how it seems from the otherâ€™s perspective and willingness to honor it is so essential to responsible travel.
Thanks so much for writing this.
Reply Jackie March 4 2020 at 113 pm Thank you for this I think itâ€™s an important reminder in an age of increasingly affordable travel for a lot of people lâ€™ll go because I can!â€? and the competitive world of social media presence.
I canâ€™t imagine visiting a place without researching or caring about the history and ensuring that the whole picture is portrayed if I share about it.
Thatâ€™s the best way to use such privilege- to be a voice for the oppressed not another link in the chain of suffering.
Reply Paul March 5 2020 at 948 am I appreciate the sentiment here and this writer has every right to put his opinion out there.
That being said Iâ€™ve been following the war since day 1 and I have some things to say that are missing from this narrative.
The article says If you follow these accounts you get the impression the worst is behind the country.
But thatâ€™s because these bloggers are a in government-controlled territory and b likely talking to Assad supporters or those too afraid to speak out.â€? 1.
The only territories that are NOT in government control are a Idlib which is in the control of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham a terrorist organization that used to be called Jabhat Al-Nusra an Al-Qaeda offshoot.
Donâ€™t let the media fool you into thinking that these guys are somehow more benevolent than big bad ISIS which everyone was afraid ofâ€¦ they arenâ€™t and if there is a shade of difference itâ€™s only in degrees.
b parts of the failed Rojava Kurdish north-eastern part that actually recently made a deal with the Assad government because they acknowledged they would rather be with him than at the mercy of Turkey who would ethnically cleanse them or worse and c small random pockets that the US keeps saying it needs to be in because of ISISâ€? despite the caliphate being dead.
In other words the only place that a tourist can go safely relatively speaking is in fact government territory.
That goes a long way into realizing that Assad always was the least-badâ€? option here since you wonâ€™t get your head chopped off for being anything other than a Sunni.
Think about itâ€¦ are you gonna boycott the Philipines not go to Manila because Duterte is a thug? Are you gonna cancel that trip to Yosemite National Park because Trump is a closet racist? 2.
likely talking to Assad supportersâ€? â€“ that means that these people actually exist and have existed since the beginning of the war.
At some point you need to acknowledge that people who support Assad make up a significant chunk of the population.
Are their voices not relevant simply because the Syrians in exile who almost all supported the revolution through their various organizations declared it as so? I remember the war being painted as Alawites vs.
everyone else when in reality the Syrian army was always majority Sunni.
And after all the desertions and the military setbacks and tens of thousands of military deaths when it looked like Assad was going to lose the Syrian army STILL had people in it that remained loyalâ€¦ was that out of fear? Were all these people members of the Baâ€™ath party? Of course notâ€¦ there was some other type of loyalty that people in the West simply cannot fathom.
Going to a place like Syria just because you want likes on your pics is cynical and privileged youâ€™re right but a lot of people also travel because they want to put money into the economy help the local people out and learn about the culture in the process.
Letâ€™s face facts Assad has won the civil war and the people that remain in Syria are desperate to have some normalcy return to their lives including making some money running businesses that cater to travelers.
Reply DustyJ March 9 2020 at 232 am Iâ€™m shocked and disgusted at the idea of people popping gleefully into an active warzone on holiday to go and have a look at what a war looks like! It never even occurred to me that anyone would be so callous! Honestly have people no empathy? Thatâ€™s like wandering around Bergen-Belsen in 1944 taking happy-snaps or going on a coach tour across 1848 Ireland drinking champers on the bus and watching people die from the potato blight.
Would you do that? Would any normal person do that? Clearly some people would do that and then post their photos of starving Irish children on their Instagram.
Reply Hana March 9 2020 at 1129 am Thank you for writing this.
I have been seeing these blogs and thinking the same.
I agree with some of the comments above.
It can be really challenging deciding which countries you are comfortable visiting in order to support the people but not the government but war-torn Syria seems like an obvious one one to avoid.
Reply Sarah March 21 2020 at 1139 pm Drew is an idiot â€“ that isnâ€™t news.
If youâ€™re going to go to somewhere like Syria Pakistan Iran North Korea Myanmar Venezuela etc â€“ then you have a responsibility to read up ahead of time and learn about the situation so you can make an informed decision.
Syria is however a bit of a challenging one â€“ there are certainly some parts of Syria which are not safe to visit but travelers have been going to Syrian Kurdistan pretty much without interruption for the last few years.
What Drew did was not new as he would have you believe.
Visiting Syrian Kurdistan in my opinion is a good thing â€“ it helps bring tourist dollars into the economy promotes cross-cultural exchange and this area has been safe for a long time.
I do get your point here Matt but not all of Syria is a warzone.
