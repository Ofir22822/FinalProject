I spent close to three weeks in MedellÃ­n first for an extended time over the holidays and then again as I made my way from north to south.
Like I do whenever Iâ€™m in cities that long I decided to stay in as many hostels as possible to find out which were the best.
A lot of online lists purport to tell you the best hostels in the city but I found that my experiences staying in them differed so greatly from the reviews I began to think Ya know I donâ€™t think people really stayed here!â€? And there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in MedellÃ­n are Location â€“ MedellÃ­n is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In MedellÃ­n you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in MedellÃ­n that I like the most.

The dorm beds are super comfy though the beds lack privacy curtains.

â€”-> Click here to book your stay at Casa Kiwi Hostel! *** Two places I would not recommend staying are Monetâ€™s and Selina.
Monetâ€™s is new and cheap and has friendly owners but itâ€™s far from the action the walls are thin and the accommodations pretty basic.
If you were on a tight tight budget and everywhere else was full it would be good for a night.
I wouldnâ€™t spend more time there than that.
Selina is a super popular hostel with digital nomads and has locations around the world.
Itâ€™s always so hyped up that I was pretty excited to stay there.
However I was greatly disappointed with it.
It was good spot to work from they have a co-working space there are resturants on site and the bar though overpriced was nice place to meet expats and travelers but the beds were hard the rooms had little privacy and the bathrooms werenâ€™t well kept.
Given the high premium it charges I just didnâ€™t see the value in staying there.
Better to stay elsewhere and go party at Selina instead! You get more bang for your peso elsewhere.
*** So there you have it the best hostels in MedellÃ­n based on my recent firsthand experience.
You canâ€™t go wrong with any of them but by far the best best BEST hostel in the city is Los Patios.
Itâ€™s one of the greatest hostels Iâ€™ve ever stayed in! Did we miss any? If you have any suggestions leave them in the comments.

Black sheep is popular but Iâ€™m not sure why.
The rooms are really dated and smell bad.
Kinda far from everything but the metro.
Social but so are most social hostelsâ€?.
Los Patios was really nice and centrally located like Purple Monkey.
Social atmosphere could be a hit or a miss because of all the different levels.
Selina is good for big groups aka large Israeli groups.
As with most Selinaâ€™s I found that it looked nice on the outside but lacked general upkeep.
The beds were flimsy and it was just too big of a hostel for my liking.
I really liked the Colombian staff members when I was there.
They were awesome and helped me practice my Spanish but then again I could say that about most Colombians.
Reply JAMES March 20 2019 at 331 pm As a gringoâ€? who has lived in Colombia for 12 years your bestâ€? are all over priced.
I can show you many others that offer the same amenities at far lower prices.
