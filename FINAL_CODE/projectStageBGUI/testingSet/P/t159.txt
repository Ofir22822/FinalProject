I spent a month there on my first trip around the world in 2006.
I made friends wandered far and wide and really got to know the city and its people.
In fact I fell in love with Amsterdam that trip and Iâ€™ve been back to visit Amsterdam every year since.
Itâ€™s one of the most visited and backpacked cities in Europe.
And so itâ€™s filled with hundreds of hostels hotels and guesthouses.
With so many places showing up in your search results how do you know which are the best hostels in Amsterdam? I mean dozens are top ratedâ€? on Hostelworld right? Iâ€™ve been visiting Amsterdam for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places over the years.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Amsterdam are Location â€“ Amsterdam is huge and it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price â€“ In Amsterdam you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one youâ€™re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesnâ€™t offer great service.
Amenities â€“ Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff â€“ All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
Even if you donâ€™t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Amsterdam that I like the most.
