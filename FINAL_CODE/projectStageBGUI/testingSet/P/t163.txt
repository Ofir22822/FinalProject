Before I went everyone told me BogotÃ¡ wasnâ€™t anything special dirty crowded hard to get around and lacking the charm of the other big cities in Colombia.
Spend a few days there and move onâ€? they all said.
Well I spent a few days there â€” and then a few more.
I LOVED BogotÃ¡.
It felt like the most Colombianâ€? city I visited.
Itâ€™s not like the gringofied cities in the rest of the country.
Its grittyâ€? nature was what appealed to me.
BogotÃ¡ was a vibrant lively city I couldnâ€™t get enough of.
The museum scene is incredible thereâ€™s a lot of history a blossoming art community an exciting food scene a wild nightlife and super welcoming people.
It is also a huge city with a ton of tours day trips and other things to do.
You could easily spend a week here.
To help you make the most out of your visit here are my top 20 things to see and do in BogotÃ¡.
20 Things to See and Do in BogotÃ¡ 1.
Take a Free Walking Tour One of my favorite things to do when I get to a new destination is to take a free walking tour.
Itâ€™s a great way to get the lay of the land see the main sights and have a local expert answer any and all of my questions.
BeyondColombia has a great free walking tour that will give you a solid introduction to the city.
It also has a free food tour which is a terrific way to get a taste of some local Colombian dishes youâ€™ll spend around 18000 COP/$6 USD on food for the tour.
Just be sure to tip your guides! For a more specialized tour check out the BogotÃ¡ Graffiti Tour.
This one operates by donation using the money raised to reinvest in future community art projects.

This is Not Your Parentsâ€™ Colombia There are 6 Comments Anita March 26 2019 at 508 am WOW this post is a great piece so many things to do and see in Bogota! I heard itâ€™s dangerous there for solo travelers but I hope I can go there one day.
Reply Susan Moore March 28 2019 at 348 pm Anita I traveled to Colombia by myself and while Bogota is a bit edgyâ€? as Matt mentioned it is like any other big city you need to be aware of whatâ€™s going on around you and always use your gut instinct.
I stayed at a hostel in La Candelaria district.
I didnâ€™t walk around at night by myself but met lots of people at the hostel and we went out in groups.
During the daytime I felt fine walking around this historic area on my own.
Bogota is an amazing city so I hope you do visit.
Reply Staci K March 26 2019 at 458 pm My favorite city in Colombia.
As long as youâ€™re smart and try to blend in as much as you can and donâ€™t use the transmilenio during rush hour really easy to use or carry your phone out of your purse only check it when you quickly stop in a store or cafe itâ€™s a safe city.
Itâ€™s an amazing city and to be honest shopping in Chapinero is very good if youâ€™re into those sort of thing.
But yea I felt 3 days werenâ€™t enough for Bogota and I wanted to stay longer plus it had my ideal temperature.
Reply Kathleen April 4 2019 at 950 am Paloquemao market was one place we visited on our trip to bogota in February that Matt did not mention.
Between the flowers  Colombia is one of the worlds leading exporters of roses to the beautiful exotic fruits and fresh foods itâ€™s a fantastic place to wander in the morning.
The hardest thing about Bogota is getting around.
We used uber but heard it is not legal and taxis throw stones at uber cars.
Solution is to sit in front seat.
City is spread out with more than 10 million people.
Traffic is horrible.
Reply Patty Dwyer April 5 2019 at 720 pm thanks for sharing with us about unfortunate situation mugging stab.
being in public hospital gave you the insight- interesting.
Hope youâ€™re feeling much better.
would be neat to read and see pictures of people and inside their home.
Reply Lara Hayes December 3 2019 at 949 pm Iâ€™ve heard a lot of negative comments about Bogota but I agree with you.
I really like the city.
Iâ€™ve spent 5 weeks here taking spanish lessons and exploring and I donâ€™t get why people are so mean about it.
I am sad you got knifed here but I am glad you have given such a balanced view on it.
I have felt largely safe whilst in Bogota ð?™‚ Reply Leave a Comment Cancel reply By posting a comment you agree to our community friendly anti-spam comment policy that can be found here.
