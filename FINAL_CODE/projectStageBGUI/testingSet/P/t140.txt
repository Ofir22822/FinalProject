With world-class beaches unusual wildlife stunning natural landscapes a unique history and a fun and vibrant culture Australia has something to offer every traveler who makes the journey to the Land Down Under.
While the country is easy to navigate as a solo traveler there are also plenty of amazing tour options for those who prefer traveling in groups or who might not have the time to plan their own getaway.
I’ve been visiting Australia since 2006 and have used many tour companies over the years in addition to getting around on my own.
So in this post I share my list of the best travel companies in Australia to help you make the most out of your next trip.
From simple walking tours to in-depth multi-day excursions there’s something on the list for every interest — and every budget! Quick Overview Best Bike Tour Bonza Bike Tours Best Walking Tour I’m Free Best Party Tour The Magic Bus Best Multi-Day Tour Intrepid Travel 1.
Best Bike Tour Company Bonza Bike Tours Bonza is a bike tour company in Sydney that offers a number of options depending on what you’re interested in.
The Highlights tour lasts 2.5 hours and will show you all the major points of interest in Sydney.
It’s suitable for families and kids as well costing 99 AUD $68 USD for adults and 79 AUD $54 USD for children.
For a more in-depth experience the Classic tour lasts four hours and will give you a much more thorough introduction to this world-class city.
They also offer bike rentals so you can just explore the city on your own in case you don’t have the time for a full-tour.

Best Walking Tour Company I’m Free I always like to start a trip with a free walking tour as they are a helpful way to get oriented and ask a local all my questions.
Both Sydney and Melbourne have insightful and free! walking tours offered by I’m Free.
Their tours last 2-3 hours and are a great way to learn about history and culture from a local.
There are a few tour options in each city so you have some flexibility with timing as well as which areas you focus on.
If you haven’t done much research before your arrival this is a good company to start with.
Be sure to tip your guide at the end! —> Click here to learn more about I’m Free! 3.
Runner Up Walking Tour Company iCity Tours If you find yourself all the way out in Perth iCity Tours has a handful of awesome free walking tours.
They are organized by Visit Perth and run by volunteers so it’s a fun way to interact with the locals and really get a sense of what life is like in Australia’s underrated coastal city.
There are five different free tours on offer each lasting around 90 minutes.
The Orientation tour offers a quick introduction to the city and its past.
If you have more time be sure to check out the Convicts and Colonials tour as well.
It will give you a sense of what life was like as a convict in Western Australia.

Best Party Tour Company The Magic Bus This backpacker bus is the perfect choice for travelers looking to party.
Each month the trip departs with 25 backpackers aged 18-35 for 3-4 weeks of exploring the country’s national parks camping bonfires and non-stop parties and shenanigans.
Trips go from Perth north to Broome or east to Melbourne each month so you have to time your trip accordingly to line up with the set departure.
The itineraries are always flexible as they let riders vote on where to go and what to do so every trip is unique.
They try to keep a balance of 50% men and 50% women as well as a balance of different nationalities so there is always a diverse group.
Trips begin at 1200 AUD $822 USD per person.

Runner Up The Oz Experience With The Oz Experience you’ll get a pass for 60-90 days.
Instead of guides you’ll be given a list of activities such as diving ATV trips sailing and surfing camps that are included in your pass to do whenever you want based on your schedule.
It’s a flexible compromise for people looking for some guidance but who also want independence.
Prices vary from 1139 to 3519 AUD $781 to $2412 USD depending on how many excursions are included as well as how many days your bus pass is valid for.
While this is a hugely popular option I personally dislike this company.
I really found it lacking so I would skip this and take The Magic Bus instead.
While lots of people like The Oz Experience I just didn’t find good value for the money.

Our Top Tour Pick Intrepid Travel Intrepid is my go-to travel company when it comes to multi-day excursions.
In Australia they offer 70 different itineraries to choose from ranging from a quick two-day tour to an in-depth 24-day adventure around the entire country.
Unlike some of the companies above this is not a party tour.
They are small groups led by expert local guides with a focus on culture history and food as well as ethical travel and leaving a small environmental impact.
You’re guaranteed to return home with a much deeper and more nuanced appreciation of your destination.
And you’ll get a much broader range of ages and travel styles with Intrepid tours too it’s not just for backpackers.
With such a wide range of travelers choosing Intrepid tours you always end up with an awesome group of people to travel with.
I’ve been on a handful of their tours over the years and have never been disappointed.
I always learn a ton and meet amazing people.
They make sure you have enough things to do without planning out every minute of the day so it’s a good balance of downtime and tours.
I can’t recommend them enough.
