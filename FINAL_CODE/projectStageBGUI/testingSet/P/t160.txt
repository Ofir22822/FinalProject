Little known nerd fact My parents took my friend Matt and me to NYC because we won a free trip for placing first me and second him in the Massachusetts state championship of the card game Magic The Gathering.
Yes you read that correctly! As you probably know NYC is one of the best foodie cities in the world â€” you can find cuisines from every ethnicity here.
And from dollar pizza slices to expensive $400 USD meals at Per Se it also has food to cover all price ranges.
Because of the variety and quality of food here I rarely cook at home kitchens are small and thereâ€™s better food everywhere! and so over the years Iâ€™ve developed a robust list of recommended restaurants that I want to share with you now.
My 25 Favorite Restaurants in NYC 1.
Corner Bistro 331 W.
4th Street World-famous for its thick and greasy hamburgers I think this is one of the best burger joints in the city.
This tiny dimly lit bar is definitely not the restaurant you would expect to find such mouthwatering food.
I bet they havenâ€™t cleaned the grill in ages which makes the burgers have such an amazing taste.
Iâ€™m sure the drinks here are good too but I only ever come for the burger.
2.
The Fat Radish 17 Orchard Street With some of the best farm-to-table organic food in the entire city the menu here changes based on seasonality offers lots of vegetarian options and will leave you full and feeling healthy.
3.
Hot Kitchen 104 Second Avenue Delicious fiery Szechuan food at a great price.
This isnâ€™t the place to get General Tsoâ€™s.
Itâ€™s the real deal.
Try the tripe pigâ€™s intestine â€“ itâ€™s delicious! Be warned though the food here is really spicy! Since Iâ€™m a wimp when it comes to spicy food my stomach still suffers the day after I eat there but if you love fiery food or are willing to suffer the consequences donâ€™t miss this place.
4.
Jeffreyâ€™s Grocery 172 Waverly Place Located in the West Village this is not a cheap meal most mains are $20 USD but they pour heavy heavy glasses of wine and have some of my favorite oysters and seafood in the city.
They also host a $1 USD oyster happy hour on their entire selection 4â€“6pm during the week which I think is the best deal in the city! 5.
Miss Korea BBQ 10 W.
32nd Street This is my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in the city.
Granted Iâ€™m not a Korean BBQ expert but the meat here is delicious and they give you a TON of sides of a dizzying variety which to me is the best part of Korean BBQ.
Bring on the unlimited kimchi!.
The fact that itâ€™s usually full of Koreans is something I take as a good sign.
6.
SriPraPhai Thai Restaurant 64-13 39th Avenue Flushing Queens The best and most authentic Thai restaurant in New York.
As someone who has lived in Thailand I rarely find a place I like.
Itâ€™s never as good.
I hardly ever get Thai food because Iâ€™m always disappointed but this place is the real thing.
Itâ€™s as close to getting to eating in Thailand as you can get.
I especially like the som tam papaya salad here.
Itâ€™s legit.
7.
Tomoe Sushi 172 Thompson Street This tiny restaurant serves big cuts of fish on perfectly warmed rice.
Their torofatty tuna is outstanding.
Tomoe is considered one of the best sushi bars in the city and gets packed quickly so come early or for lunch.
Prices here arenâ€™t on the cheap side but their $18 USD lunch set offers the best value.
8.
Yuba 105 E.
9th Street My favorite sushi bar in the city this little restaurant is easily missed.
I visit here too often â€” so often they gave me cake on my birthday and call me up when they have hard-to-get or especially fresh fish.
I take all my friends here.
Itâ€™s consistently the best sushi Iâ€™ve found for the best price.
Try the lemon roll you have to ask for it itâ€™s not on the menu the toro and the uni.
Tell Jack and Nina that I sent you.
9.
Russ & Daughters 179 E.
Houston Street This is the best breakfast and brunch joint in the city hands down.
Nothing even comes close.
Come here for latkes lox plates world-class cream cheese and anything else breakfast/deli like you can think of.
There are two sections the restaurant and the deli.
The restaurant always has a long long wait so if you donâ€™t get there early itâ€™s better to grab from the deli around the corner and eat elsewhere.
10.
Left Bank 117 Perry Street Located in the West Village this French restaurant offers a wonderful $20 USD Sunday prix fixe dinner that is one of the best budget meals in the city.
You get two courses and wine in a romantically lit setting.
My roommates and I also come here often especially if we want a nice quiet bonding evening! 11.
Sao Mai 203 1st Ave A great Vietnamese place located near my apartment this place serves pho that rocks my world.
The portions are huge here and according to my friend Jodi who is an expert in all food Vietnamese this place is authentic.
12.
Sâ€™MAC 345 E 12th St A mac-and-cheese shop that takes the traditional dish and makes it even better.
Itâ€™s heavenly cheesy goodness.
Their 4-Cheese and Cheeseburger are my two favorites.
The fact that this place is around the block from my house has become a problem though â€” Iâ€™m eating there too often and may be getting a Sâ€™MAC belly! 13.
Masala Times 194 Bleecker St I was only recently turned on to this place near the NYU campus.
Serving Bombay-style street food this place serves some really good Indian meals.
I couldnâ€™t get enough of it.
The plates are sharable and you get rice and bread too.
Try the Fish Tikka â€” itâ€™s delicious.
14.
Vanessaâ€™s Dumpling 220 E 14th St I stumbled upon this place in the East Village while walking home one day it was only later that I found out itâ€™s actually quite famous.
After eating their dumplings itâ€™s easy to see why.
They were delicious â€” the pork dumplings had an intense flavor to them.
And at 10 for $2 the price is just right.
15.
Prosperity Dumplings 46 Eldridge St Located in Chinatown this is another amazing dumpling place.
The pork dumplings come fried or steamed and thereâ€™s a nearby park where you can sit if this tiny place is full.
And if you want more for later? You can buy 50 frozen dumplings for $8! 16.
Johnâ€™s on Bleecker 278 Bleecker St Pizza in New York is an institution and I admit Iâ€™m no pizza guru.
To me itâ€™s either bad good or really good.
I canâ€™t make those fine pizza distinctions like some New Yorkers can.
I qualify Johnâ€™s as really good.
The thin-style pizza comes in huge portions big enough to serve three.
Service is quick but expect to wait for a table during dinner.
17.
Chelsea Market 75 9th Ave Chelsea Market is more a collection of food places than a single restaurant.
Itâ€™s extremely popular and a great place to pop into when you need some groceries a meal or snacks.
Youâ€™ll find good Thai food here and Amyâ€™s Bread has amazing bread.
The Lobster Place has decent sushi and great lobster but I really enjoy their clam chowder.
If you want a meal with local and organic food try the Green Table.
18.
Rosemaryâ€™s 18 Greenwich Ave This West Village Italian restaurant boasts a rooftop farm with fresh produce and herbs that goes directly into the food you eat.
Their handmade pastas are a must-eat and they have a good RosÃ© selection.
Itâ€™s one of the best weekend brunch locations in the city too.
Come early because it fills up really quickly especially on nice warm day.
19.
Bennieâ€™s Thai CafÃ© 88 Fulton St As someone who has lived in Thailand Iâ€™m quite picky about my Thai but this restaurant is legit.
Itâ€™s a popular lunch spot with the working crowd and serves incredible curry.
Itâ€™s one of the few locations where I can get an authentic Thai iced tea too! Service is a little too fast and abrupt but who cares? The food is incredible.
20.
Mamounâ€™s Falafel 119 MacDougal St You will find inexpensive falafel and gyro stands all over Manhattan but the best one is Mamounâ€™s.
You can pick up a classic falafel with tahini and salad for less than $5 but all the options here are tasty and affordable.
21.
Karasu 166 Delkab Ave This is often considered a restaurant and cocktail bar but itâ€™s more of an izakaya speakeasy youâ€™ll need to enter through a secret door.
It has an elegant ambiance and the drinks are top-notch.
The menu isnâ€™t huge but everything is delicious.
22.
Peter Luger Steakhouse 255 Northern Blvd Located in Williamsburg this is the best steakhouse in the city.
Itâ€™s an institution in the city.
The restaurant has a German beer hall feel and the steak which they age in-house is some of the best Iâ€™ve had in my life.
23.
Eatâ€™s Khao Man Gai  518 E 6th St This is a tiny restaurant with a limited menu but the food here is absolutely delicious.
Their Thai-style Hainanese chicken and rice is simple but tasty.
24.
Friend of a Farmer 77 Irving Pl Since 1986 Friend of a Farmer has been embracing the farm-to-table movement offering seasonal dishes as well as classic comfort food.
The food is filling and hearty.
They have a great brunch too! 25.
Peteâ€™s Tavern 129 E 18th St This vintage bar has been open since 1864.
Itâ€™s an unpretentious place where you can enjoy some pub food and enjoy that classic tavern atmosphere.
*** After living in the city for years this list reflects what I think are some of the best and most unique offerings the Big Apple has to offer.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg too.
New York City has some of the greatest bars and restaurants in the world and you could spend a lifetime and a fortune trying them all.
But donâ€™t take my word for it.

February 8 2016 at 210 pm Matt how do you do those mapped lists that show details for each spot? Would love to add that to my site as I review breweries and restaurants in and around NYC.
Hard to condense NYC down to such a short list but Iâ€™d add Friend of a Farmer near Gramercy Park and Jacobâ€™s Pickles on the Upper West Side for brunch.
The latter has fried chicken sandwiches on homemade buttermilk biscuits.
Get there early! Reply Asar February 8 2016 at 1057 pm You can easily create the map that Matt has with My Maps On Google.
Just search for it on Google.

February 28 2016 at 522 pm Hey Matt! Iâ€™ve been bizzzy but just thought Iâ€™d put my two cents in since I am back on your site again.
You may remember Iâ€™m in NYC too and I agree with Kyle B.
itâ€™s hard to condense NYC down to such a short list! I am on the upper west side but I travel to all boroughs & neighborhoods on a regular basis -except Staten Island.
I cook on a regular basis now but many of the good places Iâ€™ve visited are still around! Ive been here for 19 years.
I am guessing you live downtown near the former 5points area but I have a bunch of recommendations for you all over the city!! Whatâ€™s the best way to share that info- I wonder? D Reply Beatrice February 8 2016 at 531 pm That sushi looks so good and all the other options to dine out are equally as tempting! Thanks Matt for sharing these good addresses with us.
Havenâ€™t been to NYC yet so this will be very handy for a foodie like me.
Reply Stephen Gollan February 8 2016 at 749 pm New York is such a foodie destination.
I love all the different avenues designated to different cultural cuisines.
I particularly love the Sushi in New York! Cant wait to get back to New York and try some of these places you recommended Matt! Reply Angela February 8 2016 at 1025 pm This is a great international list! I miss eating in NYC.
Gotta get back there soon! Reply Daniela February 9 2016 at 855 am I absolutely love to eat an international food when In New York.
I will definitely visit some of the places you recommended in your list! Reply Suze February 9 2016 at 918 am I like the sound of the Fat Radish for one the name is great and for two Iâ€™m a fan of fork to table restaurants Reply Corynne February 9 2016 at 1142 am I love that NYC is one of the those places you can visit a bunch of times and still discover new things.
Thanks for sharing! Reply Karen Rowley February 9 2016 at 319 pm These all look amazing.
Having spent 8 years going to New York to visit two kids in college there may I suggest Cherce Midi Tia Pol and Maletesta? All wonderful downtown restaurants.
Matt as a new fellow blogger I just started reading your blog and want to tell you how much I already love it! Reply Pepper Dasnee February 10 2016 at 748 pm This post is making me want to be in New York right now! Thank you for sharing this list ð?™‚ Reply Lyndsay February 11 2016 at 1135 pm Hmm never been to one of those.
I will keep this in mind on my next visit! Thanks for sharing! Reply Michele February 12 2016 at 1209 am Matt have you ever done NYC Restaurant Week? Most of the special pre-fixe menus are pretty reasonable and the list of participating restaurants is good.
Reply Shannon February 13 2016 at 137 am Pretty sure I want to visit NY just to get fat nowâ€¦.
Suddenly I am very hungry.
Great post! Reply Alex February 15 2016 at 248 pm This is a great list! I love the variety.
That is one of the things I love most about NYC is that there is every type of restaurant that you could possibly be looking for.
Percyâ€™s Pizza looks very good and I want to try it next time I am in town.
Besides all the delicious restaurants have you ever tried any of the food carts on the street? There are a lot of yummy ones to try.
Reply Pierce Sohlden February 15 2016 at 924 pm Hey Matt This list helps a lot.
I have been to NYC before but it was when I was very young so I do not remember anything.
So I donâ€™t really count that time and NYC is at the near the top of my list of places to go.
When I go there this will really help me know where I want to go and what to expect from these restaurants I wonâ€™t have to spend forever trying to find places to eat.
Thanks for the list! Reply Candie February 17 2016 at 400 pm Great list Matt! During my last trip to NYC in May I was lucky enough to stumble upon the wonderful market that is Madison Square Eats.
I loved the pizza and gourmet ice cream sandwiches.
Thanks for this list Iâ€™ll definitely use it on my next trip to the city! Reply Jill February 18 2016 at 1056 pm SriPraPha is in Woodside Queens.
You have it as Flushing.
You should venture to Flushing and explore the places in Prince Streets and the basement food stalls.
Youâ€™re missing out not trying the 7 line restaurants.
Reply Pamela February 19 2016 at 209 am I love travelling and more than that I love food.
So this post would love really helpful for me on my vist to New York.
Thanks for sharing ð?™‚ Reply Carmen February 22 2016 at 1051 am wow some of these foods really look and sound mouth watering.
I am a fan of healthy food and well American foods are known to be big and greasy but cannot help try some of them if I go to America.Thanks for the list Matt.
Reply Holly February 24 2016 at 343 am I love New York! Have you tried PizzArte? 69 W 55th St â€“ I highly recommend.
Or if you are just craving for some Mac n Cheese there is always Sâ€™Mac! Reply Angela Farmery October 12 2019 at 926 am Thanks Matt we recently visitors New York and tried out the Miss Korea BBQ which was our first time eating Korean food and we loved it.
