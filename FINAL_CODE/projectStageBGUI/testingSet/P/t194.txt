And with more time behind me than ahead of me I leave June 19 as I look back on my time here I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve seen as much of Paris as I intended.
I havenâ€™t visited one new attraction.
Or taken one day trip out of the city.
Or gone to another region of the country.
Or even the outlying neighborhoods of the city really.
Nothing.
I have taken five walking tours so I did something.
But thatâ€™s it.
Thatâ€™s the extent of my explorations of Paris.
But as I mull that over I realize I donâ€™t really care about that stat.
Because Iâ€™ve done what I came to Paris to do create a quiet life.
My time here so far has been characterized more by writing sleeping and overall just generally chilling.â€? Iâ€™ve made a few friends â€” and thanks to said new friends exponentially increased the number of favorite restaurants and bars on my Google map.
So I guess if I have done a lot of anything itâ€™s eating and drinking.
Every place every moment has a lesson in it.
Every place is perfect for certain times in your life.
Thailand was the place I need to explore my independent self.
New York City was what I needed when I transitioned from nomad to non-nomad.
They were the perfect bridges to a new phase of life.
Paris is my bridge to a quieter life.
But more than that Paris has taught me something about myself I didnâ€™t fully realize until now Iâ€™m the most motivated when I feel I have limited time.
I came to Paris guns blazing with a grand vision that Iâ€™d have all this time to explore.
I was going to do so much.
But three-hour lunches take up a lot of your day.
So does work.
So does dinner with friends.
So do a plethora of visits from other friends.
When you live somewhere instead of just visiting thereâ€™s always tomorrow.
When I feel like thereâ€™s a tomorrow Iâ€™m less inclined to leave my comfort zone.
I work read sleep and eat.
So I always put everything off.
I wanted to work anyways.
I was in no rush.
But eventually you run out of tomorrows.
Suddenly you wake up and months have passed and you marvel at how quickly time went by.
Now the clock is ticking down rapidly and Iâ€™m ready to kick things into high gear.
With only about six weeks in Europe left and only half of them in Paris Iâ€™ve begun to book more walking tours museum visits and cooking classes plus trips to Bordeaux and Normandy.
Booking all this in advance ensures I wonâ€™t find a work reason to skip it! Looking back I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d change a thing though.
I needed some R&R.
Not only from travel but from life.
I needed time to get my head right again.
To wind down projects relax and get some motivation back.
I needed to take a step back and hit the reset button.
Iâ€™m heading to Normandy next week.
After that Iâ€™m off to Italy.
Then itâ€™s my birthday.
Then itâ€™s home.
For now at least.
After that who knows? If Paris reminded me of anything itâ€™s that I need to stop planning and accept that when I do make plans Iâ€™m likely to just do the opposite.
I just need to see where the day takes me.

Also as a side note your Jordan trip is exactly one year to the date from my own so itâ€™s giving me serious travel nostalgia! Reply Dan May 20 2019 at 934 am So true thats why I like it when friends visit me in Austin it forces me to plan fun things to do.
I also like the idea of creating bucket listsâ€? of things you want to do in a short period of time like an Austin Summer 2019 bucket list.
Reply Sandra May 20 2019 at 1019 am Iâ€™m happy you are listening to what your mind body and spirit are telling you! So many times we just push through with dull senses.
Be sure to see Mont Saint Michael while up in Normandy! Itâ€™s simply breathtaking.
Stay the night inside the walls as itâ€™s a different place after the tour busses leave! Happy Travels Matt! Sandi Reply Candice Walsh May 20 2019 at 1112 am I felt completely the same way when I moved to Berlin.
SUCH a different experience than just visiting.
The last few weeks of living there were jam-packed with doing all the things I didnâ€™t get around to doing though.
I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the same thing happens to you.
Reply Carolyn May 21 2019 at 618 am Paris is such a great city to work and do not much in.
The French know how to do things for joy or pleasure and not out of obligation and thatâ€™s something from the city I definitely take elsewhere with me! Enjoy the last few weeks.
Also PLEASE got to Holybelly for a 3 hour lunch.
Get the pancakes with eggs and bourbon butter.
Thank me later.
Reply Caleb May 22 2019 at 241 pm Hi Matt Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re busy as ever but Iâ€™m Caleb an aspiring travel writer whoâ€™s been following your page for quite a long time now.
Youâ€™re one of the primary reasons I had the courage to start my new travel page on Instagram.
Iâ€™ll be in Paris from Friday-Tuesday with my family and I would love to connect with you and buy you a coffee or something to chat about travel blogging for half an hour.
I figure itâ€™s a long shot but Iâ€™m becoming very passionate about travel blogging and thought it was worth taking the chance and asking! Feel free to email me at the address listed below if youâ€™re interested.
Reply NomadicMatt May 23 2019 at 544 am Iâ€™m not in Paris at the moment! Sorry! ð?™? Reply John Smith May 22 2019 at 710 pm Really Paris is a great city to work and live.
Last year i also travelled to Paris with my family.
It was really a great experience.
Your blog made me remind that time.
Reply Zhanna May 22 2019 at 807 pm Itâ€™s a great summary of your time in Paris Matt.
I like that you donâ€™t regret any day of your quieter life here.
However you made a good point that you always think that you have tomorrow.
And tomorrow you think about another tomorrow.
Itâ€™s interesting how you loose this concept as soon as the time becomes an issue.
Reply NomadicMatt May 23 2019 at 539 am Thanks! Reply Rafael May 23 2019 at 1107 am Hey Matt Thank you for sharing your experience of Paris with us.
Regarding what you commented in the post I believe that we are all moved by the despair of the endâ€?.
We begin to value things when we are losing.
I do this a lot in my life in basically all areas.
Enjoy a lot.
Reply Aaron Salyer May 26 2019 at 407 pm Ha nothing like running out time to give you a little push.
Think people are always underestimating the importance of time running out.
Weâ€™ve changed our travel style over the last few years to stay longer at places.
We constantly want more time! Now we aim to stay at a place for about 3 months at a time to really get the feel for it.
While weâ€™ve been focusing on tropical islands Paris is one place weâ€™d love to post up for a few months too.
Thanks for sharing! Safe travels Reply Mol May 27 2019 at 526 am Hey Matt! Love your honest take on things and of course the broke way of travelling ð?™‚ very curious â€“ why havenâ€™t you been to India though you been full time Nomad since 10+ years!! Reply Per Christiansen May 28 2019 at 157 pm Hi Matt Donâ€™t miss the The Bayeux Tapestry when in Normandy.
I am of Viking ancestry and the Tapestry is a beautiful history of the Vikings in Normandy.
