Shall we go somewhere else?â€? my friends asked.
Sure letâ€™s get the bill!â€? I replied.
When our check came I was reminded of something about Sydney I had forgotten its high prices.
Even with a currently weak Australian dollar Sydney was more expensive than I remembered.
With its 10 AUD sandwiches 10 AUD beers 19 AUD cocktails 30 AUD hostels sometimes up to 40 AUD!!! and outrageous restaurant prices Sydney can burn a hole in your wallet quicker than actual fire.
It was going to be an expensive two weeks if I didnâ€™t figure out how to enjoy the best this city had to offer on a budget.
Leaving no stone unturned OK probably one or two I found several ways to save big here â€“ while still filling your days and having a lot of fun.
While Syndey is never going to be the cheapest destination to travel to in the world there are plenty of ways to save money in Syndey thanks to all the free and cheap things to do there.
Between museums markets beaches nature walks and some local deals there are plenty of ways to lower your costs on your next visit! Iâ€™ve divided this blog posts into two sections Part 1 Free things to do in Sydney Part 2 Cheap things to do in Sydney Just click on the link above and get to the section you want! Free Things to Do in Sydney 1.
Get an Opal card This metro card is free â€” you just need to load it with money â€” and worth using for three reasons it offers discounted fare compared to purchasing one-use tickets this varies by distance thereâ€™s a maximum fare charge of 15 AUD per day and on Sundays the maximum is 2.50 AUD.
That means you can go anywhere on the transportation system â€“ whether by metro ferry or light rail â€“ and youâ€™ll never pay more than 2.50 AUD! Itâ€™s an amazing deal.
2.
Explore the free museums Australia has a lot of expensive museums but tons of free ones too.
Some worth considering are The Mint a small exhibit on how they used to make money The Australia Center for Photography The White Rabbit Gallery beautiful art The Manly Art Museum The Sydney Observatory The Rocks Discovery Museum! 3.
The Art Gallery of New South Wales The Art Gallery of NSW is one of my favorite museums in the city.
There are so many exquisite landscape paintings portraits and statues in its collection by Australian and European artists and even a few by Monet.
Itâ€™s a really substantial collection.
Some of my favorites were Albert Hansonâ€™s Pacific Beachesâ€? Guerardâ€™s Jebel Cheribâ€? and Milford Soundâ€? Peter Paul Rubensâ€™ Self-Portraitâ€? and Battenâ€™s Snowdrop and the Seven Little Men.â€? 4.
The Museum of Contemporary Art The contemporary art museum also is free and features Australian artists including many Aboriginals.
While Iâ€™m not a huge fan of this type of art bottles on the floor is NOT art the Aboriginal collection was breathtaking.
You can really feel the artistsâ€™ connections to their land and culture as well as the pain of past attempts to take it away from them.
5.
Visit the beaches Sydney is a city famous for its free beaches and thereâ€™s no better way to spend one of the cityâ€™s many sunny days than by enjoying one of them.
Try to avoid going on the weekends when they fill up and you have to fight for space.
While Bondi is the most famous be sure to check out some of these other great beaches Manly Watsonâ€™s Bay Coogee Bronte my favorite 6.
Take a nature walk There are a number of stunning public coastal walks that allow you to take in the breathtaking natural beauty of Sydneyâ€™s harbor and coastal cliffs.
While tons of people do the two-hour Coogee-to-Bondi walk avoid it on the weekends I found Watsonâ€™s Bay and the Split-to-Manly walks quieter more relaxing and beautiful.
Some other walks worth checking out are Rose Bay to Watsonâ€™s Bay Watsonâ€™s Bay to Dover Heights Chowder Bay to Balmoral Beach Jibbon Beach Loop Track 7.
Free walking tours One of the best ways to explore a new city is by taking a free walking tour.
These will introduce you to all the major sites and give you a solid introduction to the cityâ€™s history and culture.
Best of all these tours are free just make sure to tip!.
Two suggested companies for walking tours in Sydney are Iâ€™m Free Walking Tours Daily tours of the city center and The Rocks Sydneyâ€™s original settlement.
Sydney Greeters This is a free service that connects you with locals who will show you their neighborhood advanced booking required.
Cheap Things to Do in Sydney 8.
Take the Town Hall tour Built in 1889 Sydneyâ€™s beautiful town hall is a picturesque Victorian building.
On Tuesday mornings thereâ€™s a detailed two-hour tour that you can take for only 5 AUD.
Itâ€™s a great way to learn some extra history about the building as well as the city.
9.
Visit the markets Sydney has a ton of amazing markets to walk through.
No matter what youâ€™re looking for from antiques to food to local crafts youâ€™ll likely be able to find it at a market.
I love the Paddington Market and the farmers market the best.
They draw an eclectic crowd and the farmers market makes me want to cook nonstop.
Here are some other great markets worth checking out Glebe Market Rozelle Collectors Market Orange Grove Organic Market Bondi Farmerâ€™s Market Manly Market Place Chinatown Night Market 10.
Attend one of Sydneyâ€™s many events Since Sydney has a complex about Melbourne being called the culture capital of Australia it tries to outdo its rival by hosting over dozens of events each year.
It has art gallery nights concerts festivals and much more.
Most of them are free and can be found on the Sydney tourism website.
Some of the more noteworthy events are New Yearâ€™s Eve Sydney is one of the biggest New Yearâ€™s Eve destinations in the world Lost Paradise a 3-day music festival City2Surf an annual race and fun run Vivid Sydney an annual light music and idea festival Twilight at Taronga summer music series 11.
Eat cheap! Need a cheap meal? The sushi trains around the city offer a filling meal for 10-20 AUD the noodle and dumpling shops in Chinatown offer tasty and authentic meals for less than 10 AUD and Lentil as Anything a vegetarian restaurant in Newtown offers meals on a pay as you feelâ€? system.
Another cheap place to eat is the food court in the MLC Centre a big office building in the heart of the business district and popular with office workers.
From Mexican to sushi to salads to sandwiches you can find big-portion meals for 10 AUD or less.
For more cheap eats check out El Jannah chicken sandwiches Chinese Noodle Restaurant homemade noodles Spicy Joint spicy Chinese food Spice I Am Thai food Wish Bone fried chicken and poutine 12.
Avoid the expensive stuff In many parts of the world the high end offers some value and you can walk away from an expensive meal and say that was worth every penny!â€? However thatâ€™s not often the case in Sydney.
I was always disappointed.
From cocktail bars to upscale steak and sushi dinners I always left hungry unhappy and thinking about the lack of value I got.
Stick to beer wine and the low-end restaurants when youâ€™re in town.
Youâ€™ll get more bang for your buck! 13.
Visit backpacker bars for cheap drinks Drinking in Sydney is expensive â€“ with beers costing up to 10 AUD each â€“ but the backpacker bars are where to go for a cheap pint.
World Bar and Ivy Hotel have backpacker specials for 4-7 AUD and the Peter Pan Travel Agency in Kings Cross has free drinks on Tuesdays! ***Sydney is a vibrant laid-back beach city with an incredible array of activities.
If you donâ€™t watch out it will bust your budget really fast! Sydney may not be one of the cheapest cities in the world but there are plenty of free and cheap events to keep you busy during your visit.
I found myself with plenty of full days that ended with an even fuller wallet! Book Your Trip to Sydney Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.

I was in Sydney staying at a friendâ€™s house so that helped to save big on accommodation.
But I canâ€™t believe he didnâ€™t suggest I get the Opal Card! ð?™‚ And so are the Museum and the Art Gallery free? We havenâ€™t checked any during my stay but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll hit Sydney again in future.
Reply Anca April 7 2016 at 1119 am Wow I didnâ€™t know those prices are that high.
Even though there are tons of free stuff paying 10$ for a beer hurts ð?™‚ Sydey you wonâ€™t see me yet.
Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 958 am Iâ€™d been in Australia for about three days went for a beer for my 20th Birthday and paid $14 for a Heineken.
I nearly had a heart attack haha.
Reply J April 7 2016 at 103 pm I have a soft spot for Sydney after living there for a year.
Itâ€™s definitely expensive though Iâ€™ve done most things on the list.
There are some amazing hikes that are parts of major routes even 45 minutes out in the Hornsby/Mount Colah area.
Reply Shandos April 7 2016 at 639 pm Iâ€™m from Sydney and am used to Americans saying how expensive it is so was surprised that when I recently visited Hawaii it was more expensive than I expected.
Sure there were some cheap cocktails but most food truck and cheapâ€? road side stop meals fish tacos coconut shrimp burgers were about $14 USD about $20 AUD once converted and thatâ€™s if a tip wasnâ€™t expected more expensive than in Sydney.
Is it just Hawaii? Would love to do a road trip around the US in the next few years and hoping food elsewhere is cheaper! Reply J April 7 2016 at 1116 pm Hawaii is definitely considered to be more expensive than the mainland.
As budget family travelers I didnâ€™t actually find it to be too bad the 2 times weâ€™ve gone.
However we donâ€™t go out much.
Bars restaurants Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 1004 am For America itâ€™s just about being patient and searching out a bargain.
Youâ€™re a captive audience in Hawaii you canâ€™t really escape it and it thrives on tourism.
But if you were in say San Francisco even thought itâ€™s an expensive place to live and work you can turn a corner and find a really cheap taco or BBQ place where you can spend $6-8 on a full meal.
Reply Angeli Gette April 7 2016 at 726 pm I am glad you got to visit Sydney my hometown it is definitely expensive but it is a great place to live and work.
Wages are higher as well so it is relative to the earnings and there are always cheaper options.
Youâ€™re definitely right â€“ higher price does not mean that it is going to be great.
Iâ€™ve been disappointed many times with over-priced meals which were crap.
Iâ€™d rather just a regular meal instead of the fancy stuff.
I love Sydney but my husband and I are heading off to be digital nomads on Tuesday.
First stop â€“ bangkok.
Thanks for the great content Matt.
Reply Nicole April 7 2016 at 813 pm As a Sydney sider itâ€™s quite funny to read this.I would normally think $10 is a bargain lunch haha but yes it is quite expensive now that I think of it.
Some other free things that are worth doing is visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens or Centennial Park.
Fun for a picnic/bike ride/walk.
Good way to waste some hours and feed some ducks.
Reply J April 7 2016 at 1122 pm Going to Sydney for the first time this year.
Itâ€™s going to be a long flight.
Iâ€™m going to the symphony at the opera house and I didnâ€™t think tickets were very expensive.
Free stuff will definitely also be on the agenda too.
Reply Victoria April 8 2016 at 308 am Thanks for the tips Matt! I havenâ€™t been to Australia yet but will keep it all in mind.
I think the prices are reasonable for a nation such as Australia but of course if one goes there straight from Asia itâ€™s an awful shock! Having said that Iâ€™m with you on the point that spending lots of money doesnâ€™t necessarily mean better quality and it should! p.s.
If doing a world trip with Australia New Zealand & South East Asia itâ€™s best to start with the more expensive countries first and then work your way down rather than the other way around! Reply Bruno April 8 2016 at 854 am Great tips and thanks for showing exploring Sydney on a budget is possible! Reply Stephen Gollan April 8 2016 at 953 am Great look into Sydney! Its always good to see what other enjoy about a location that is quite traveled by many.
Love the tips on how to visit Sydney on a budget.
Sydney is a very expensive destination for most.
So these tips can allow those on a tight budget to see this wonderful city! Thanks Matt Reply Kate April 8 2016 at 212 pm Getting a local train or transportation pass is always a GREAT way to save.
We did that in Brussels Tokyo Bangkok and London.
You can save $20-50! Iâ€™d also suggest just buying food from a grocery store you can make your own food for much cheaper.
Or I suppose itâ€™s never too late to go on a fasting diet .
Reply Indrani April 8 2016 at 1152 pm These tips are going to get me richer.
I donâ€™t believe in splurging while traveling these tips are sure helpful.
Reply Sophie April 9 2016 at 224 am Awesome guide! Iâ€™m going to Sydney in August and it will definitely be on a budget so this will come in handy ð?™‚ Reply Mia April 9 2016 at 654 am I couldnâ€™t agree more! I used to live in Australia for 1.5 year and all that I would hear about Sydney is how expensive the city is.
When I eventually came to visit Sydney I made an effort to mix in a few really cheap activities to keep the cost down.
I quickly realized that the city has a lot of really cheap or free activities to do.
Reply Sebrin April 9 2016 at 239 pm Oh man Sydney is such a killer! But I love these tips.
I was lucky to do some of them like the nature walks and visiting the markets.
It was perfection and it doesnâ€™t feel like a freeâ€? type of event.
Thanks for sharing Matt! Reply Lilly April 10 2016 at 238 pm Very helpful information Sydney is definitely on my to doâ€? list but i havenâ€™t been yet because of the high costs.
This will surely help.
Reply KD April 11 2016 at 801 pm At around 4pm most restaurants offer half price on their meals.
I can sometimes get a bento box for just $5.
So watch out for those.
Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 952 am I found that the ferry across to Manly is a great way to take in a lot of the sites that you donâ€™t really need to see up close for the couple of bucks that it takes you to get on there and go across.
Plus Shelly Bay in Manly is one of the best free excursions you can do on.
Also the Pylon Lookout next to the Harbour Bridge is a nice little but of insider-knowledge if you want a similar view but want to save yourself $230 AUD on going up the bridge.
I think it cost me about $15 to get up there this was in 2012 but it satisfied me and my budget just as much.
Thanks for the article Matt ð?™‚ Reply Wai April 14 2016 at 945 am The best way to survive in Sydney is to go with friends and rent an apartment.
In september I rented a great apartment that could easily sleep 4 in Bondi for only $110 per night.
Cheaper than a hostel and much more comfortable! Cooking at home and beers from the bottle shop will save you heaps.
The cheapest food when I was there was definitely the sushi rolls that you can find everywhere.
Around $3 for a roll and you can have lunch for $6-$9 depending on how much you eat.
Reply Alegna January 26 2017 at 740 pm Donâ€™t forget to go to the BYO restaurants.
The cheaper restaurants either donâ€™t charge corkage or itâ€™s minimal.
Reply Ryan Biddulph April 14 2016 at 832 pm Hi Matt Weâ€™ve passed thru Sydney twice.
Once going to and from Fiji.
We paid $100 USD for a room about as big as a shoe box right by the airport.
Tis what it tis right? Overall a fab city and hey itâ€™s the cost of living bit.
Even if we paid $22 for a 3 minute taxi ride to the airport Sydney is A-OK with me.
Signing off from sunny NYC.
Ryan Reply Rekha April 18 2016 at 716 am I have found your post informative.
This post is quite helpful for budget travelers like me.
Being a nature lover and history buff I would like to visit nature rich destinations where I can capture the natural beauty of the places.
I found you have mentioned about the same in your post.
May I have some more information about hill areas around Sydney where I can explore the natural hill surroundings? Reply Cindee June 14 2016 at 339 am Two of the best things to do for free or almost free is to walk over the harbour bridge there is a pedestrian path along the side and take the circular quay to manly ferry.
Reply Mike July 11 2016 at 514 am Great post Matt especially like the part about hitting up the backpacker bars for a cheap drink.
I find they usually offer a better atmosphere as well.
I have also found some pretty good drink/ food/ tourist deals on a Facebook page called â€“ Sydney Deals.
Itâ€™s worth checking out if youâ€™re going to be in Sydney for a while and want to save some money! Reply john August 2 2016 at 106 pm I love Australia went I traveled there in 2012.
specially Sydney it was my final stop after a year being there to perfect way to end I remember walking under the harbor bridge and seeing the Sydney opera house looking back at me it was like seeing a mirage walking through the desert.
An incredible feeling.
Reply carl January 4 2017 at 253 am Hi Matt I can relate to your blog post Australia is a way more expensive than the other countries I have visited.
But places here especially in Melbourne Sydney and Tasmania is really great.
I will surely go back when I can afford to visit again hehe When I visit Melbourne and Sydney I accommodate Serviced Houses apartments are really expensive but this one is great and worth it for only $25 per night.
Ohh one thing I love about visiting Sydney is the Bondi Beach! The experience is really awesome.
Reply Rosie May 8 2017 at 145 am Great tips Matt.
Many backpackers/travellers ignore or put Sydney at the end of their travel list because it is expensive.
However there are actually lots of inexpensive places events and food to look forward to.
Reply Kate July 23 2017 at 745 pm Yes on a second thought Australia is one of the expensive places to visit or to travel.
All you need to explore things where you can go on the travel on a budget and still enjoying at the same time.
Reply Andreya September 9 2017 at 139 am Awesome post.
Really Australia is one of the most expensive places.
And we can get the most memorable moments and we can enjoy a lot .
Reply Sam November 5 2017 at 1117 am Being a Sydney Sider I can vouch for the fact that if you are not thinking about your entertainment budget it can be a super expensive affair.
Simple things like having drinks in an average bar can cost well over $50 AUD.
Thatâ€™s why I think this is a brilliant article and it can help the tourists and the locals to enjoy Sydney and without spending too much.
Reply Morkal February 16 2018 at 607 am Hey Matt! Thanks for amazing tips.
Yes Australia is a great country and Sydney is one of the most expensive cities in Australia.
We all can control phone cost shopping cost hotel rent control and food cost But we skip the cost of flight tickets.
If anyone wants to control this cost then Sekap travels is one of the best options for you as per my view.
Sekap travels provide you cheap flight tickets for Australia at a reasonable rate.
Reply Lisa C April 11 2018 at 1011 am I will be in Sydney for the next 2 weeks with my fianceâ€¦no kids!! Thanks for the great tips on what to do in Sydney if youâ€™re on a budgetâ€¦We are going to try more than one of them.
Reply Steve A September 29 2018 at 330 pm Matt heading to Sydney next sat oct 6.
Your tips of what to do cheaper are awesome.
I like the hints on how to do the twin without breaking the bank.
Most appreciated my good man! Well done.
Reply DJR November 8 2018 at 421 am The roof of The Museum of Contemporary Art is also one of the best views of the Opera House.
