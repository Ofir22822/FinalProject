Israel is home to thousands upon thousands of years of history as well as key historical sites for the three major monotheistic religions making this a destination for millions of tourists and pilgrims every year.
The country is pretty small and you can get around it very easily especially if you rent a car.
Itâ€™s just 290 miles from Haifa on the northern tip of Israel to Eliat in the south about five hours of driving.
That said some people donâ€™t want to drive and some places out in the desert are hard to get to.
For those people there are tours! There are lots of options from walking tours in Tel Aviv to multiday tours across the country and neighboring countries.
Iâ€™ve put together a list of my favorite tour companies in Israel.
They focus on different kinds of travel but all offer good value for the money 1.
Abraham Tours Abraham Tours aim to suit independent travelers and give you lots of information about the culture history and politics of the region so you can be better informed while you travel around Israel.

The company has short half- or one-day tours like a Jerusalem graffiti tour for $28 or a kibbutz experience from Tel Aviv for $63.
