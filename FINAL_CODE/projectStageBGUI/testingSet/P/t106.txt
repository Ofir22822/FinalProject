From ancient structures like the Colosseum or the Pantheon to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain to the Vatican â€” not to mention tons of pasta and other delicious food â€” it has it all.
But planning a trip to Rome can sometimes be a pain.
Where should you stay? What are the best neighborhoods? Rome is huge.
It has 15 municipi administrative areas with the city center municipio alone divided into 22 smaller districts.
Whether youâ€™re after a more historical area or something more local-feeling or whether you are keen to experience great Italian food or Roman nightlife there is a neighborhood in this amazing city to suit you.
To help you figure that out here are some of my extensive thoughts on the best places to stay during your time in Rome based on my years of experience visiting there 1.
Trastevere Trastevere is filled with narrow cobblestone alleyways that run past buildings decorated with tangled ivy and vines.
It makes you feel like youâ€™re back in a medieval city.
For many centuries Trastevere was a working-class district but in recent years itâ€™s become a bohemian hotspot for foodies and tourists wanting to see beyond Romeâ€™s big-name attractions.
At night you can mingle in the Piazza di Santa Maria with crowds of young locals and students enjoying the nightlife eating and drinking.
And if you climb the nearby steps of Gianicolo Hill youâ€™ll reach a spot with views across Rome including the Pantheon and the Capitoline Hills.
Best places to stay in Trastevere BUDGET Hostel Trastevere â€“ This hostel close to grocery stores and public transit has a great outdoor terrace common area with shade sails to keep you cooler in summer and a cheap buffet breakfast as well as fast Wi-Fi and air-conditioning.
Rooms sleep a maximum of five people.
The beds are comfortable too.
MID-RANGE Trastevereâ€™s Friends â€“ This B&B is quiet with spacious double rooms making it especially popular with couples.
The rooms here are light and bright and most include ample wardrobe space for unpacking.

Each room is uniquely decorated with paintings or ornate mirrors.
Breakfast is included in your room price.
2.
Monti The very oldest part of Rome is Monti which is full of winding cobblestone streets and antique stores.
Local residents are often creative types and theyâ€™ve made sure there are plenty of quirky cafÃ©s intimate bars and independent businesses for you to explore.
You can wander the streets past endless shades of pastel-colored walls and browse the clothes and jewelry at the Mercato Monti vintage market.
Best places to stay in Monti BUDGET Palladini Hostel Rome â€“ This might be a hostel but it hasnâ€™t skimped on the dÃ©cor with stylish black- red- and white-themed communal areas and artwork and chandeliers in the private rooms.
Itâ€™s just 200m from Termini station so itâ€™s really easy to access any public transport option you might want.
BUDGET Hostel Alessandro Downtown â€“ Cleanliness a friendly staff and a social atmosphere make this a good choice.
Itâ€™s a great place to stay if you want to meet other travelers either in the hostel itself or the bar which is popular with many backpackers exploring Rome.

LUXURY Monti Palace Hotel â€“ This stylish hotel includes a wholesome buffet breakfast and a rooftop bar with gorgeous views of the city.

3.
Prati Prati is close to St Peterâ€™s Square and the Vatican â€” it shares a border with the northern end of the Vatican State â€” and includes Via Cola di Rienzo which is one of the most well-known shopping streets in the city for high-end brands.
Prati is also an area where youâ€™re less likely to find hordes of tourists and itâ€™s great for imagining what life would be like if you were a wealthy Roman.
Best places to stay in Prati BUDGET Arts & Rooms â€“ This is a great budget option with fast Wi-Fi and a communal kitchen filled with snacks guests get use of the coffee machine too.
Itâ€™s elegant with simple but tasteful furnishings.

Formerly an industrial area itâ€™s had a hipster makeover and is famous for its street art food and nightlife.
On Via Giuseppe Libetta youâ€™ll find many of Romeâ€™s best nightclubs and music venues.
Thereâ€™s even history here the ancient Pyramid of Cestius made of white marble blocks.

Itâ€™s less Italian in style than other accommodations in Rome but makes up for it with spacious quiet rooms and excellent breakfasts.
Thereâ€™s a lot of garden greenery and even a small wooded area surrounding the hotel so it feels like youâ€™re much further from central Rome than you actually are.
5.
Testaccio Testaccio a 20-minute walk south of the Colosseum is an edgier district a former slaughterhouse area now adored by foodies.
Itâ€™s not necessarily full of Instagram-worthy architecture but itâ€™s really got heart.
There are a bunch of art museums and other sightseeing spots in Testaccio but the best reason to stay here is the food from the Testaccio Market with its gourmet street food stalls to spots like Da Remo which many people claim has the best traditional pizza in Rome.
Best places to stay in Testaccio BUDGET I-sleep B&B â€“ This budget accommodation is in a really convenient location but itâ€™s still reasonably quiet.

6.
Pigneto Less than a 15-minute tram ride from the center of Rome Pigneto is a colorful neighborhood full of interesting graffiti street art and murals thatâ€™s had a hipster makeover in recent years.
Some people call it the Brooklyn of Rome and I think thatâ€™s a fair description! Itâ€™s filling up with trendy bars and restaurants and often gets labeled Bohemian although itâ€™s a real mix of small older homes and new apartment buildings.
Itâ€™s also home to lots of small cocktail bars and cafÃ©s and other great spots for some people-watching.

The hotel also has a lounge bar and the award-winning restaurant Sapori del Lord Byron.
9.
San Lorenzo If you want to stay somewhere with a student vibe then San Lorenzo is it near the Sapienza University and walking distance east of the city center.
The neighborhood was bombed heavily in World War II and was never rebuilt quite as well as other areas but what San Lorenzo lacks in prettiness it makes up for with fun.

*** Rome is a big city with lots to see and experience so figuring out which neighborhood will work best for you is partly about deciding whether you want to indulge in regular restaurant meals or nightlife or be near plenty of the historical sights or try some more local neighborhoods for a when in Romeâ€? kind of experience.
If you have a longer stay you can always consider starting in one of the inner city neighborhoods while you see the most famous sights then having a few days a little further out to enjoy shopping and dining among locals.
