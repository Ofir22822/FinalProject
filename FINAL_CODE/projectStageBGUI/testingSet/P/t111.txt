Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.

Price – In Montreal you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
