Hong Kong is one of my favorite cities in the world.
It has everything you could ever want and more.
A city of 7.3 million people it also has a ton of accommodation options.
There are literally thousands of places to stay.
And hundreds of cheap hostels! Dorm room prices do vary widely though.
They start around 125 HKD $15 USD per night but on average for a decent and clean room expect to pay closer to 150 HKD $20 USD smaller rooms are usually more expensive.
Private rooms in hostels start at around 250 HKD $30 USD per night and go as high as 500 HKD $65 USD for a double room.
Free Wi-Fi is standard at almost all hostels in town as are shared kitchens.
I’ve been visiting Hong Kong for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places.
There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.
The top four when picking the best hostel in Hong Kong are Location – HK is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around.
Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see.
All the hostels listed here are in central locations.
Price – In Hong Kong you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.
Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and some have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.
