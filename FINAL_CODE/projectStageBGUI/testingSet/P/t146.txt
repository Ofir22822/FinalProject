Itâ€™s a celebration that brings people together to celebrate all the potential that a new year offers.
Itâ€™s a day of hope and celebration.
And itâ€™s not too far away either! Soon people from around the world will be ringing in the new year soon with fireworks festivals friends parties and songs.
Itâ€™s a fun holiday that knows no nationality.
If youâ€™re ready to stay up past your bedtime and indulge in the revelry here are my top ten best places to go for New Yearâ€™s Eve in 2019 1.
New York City Times Square has been a focal point of New Yearâ€™s activity for more than a hundred years.
Around one million people will crowd into the square to watch the famous ball drop.
On top of that around a BILLION more people will watch from home making this one of the biggest events of the year â€” every year! If you want to watch the ball drop in person be sure to arrive early people start gathering in the afternoon to get a good spot and dress warmly! However there are lots of parties throughout the city and most New Yorkers try to aim for some of the downtown clubs and bars or a house party! Check out my free travel guide to New York City for more information on how to get there save money and enjoy the city during your visit! 2.
Sydney Australia is one of the first countries in the world to experience New Yearâ€™s Eve making Sydney the first major city in the world to greet a new year sorry New Zealand you arenâ€™t as big!.
The city hosts one of the largest firework displays in the world.
They last almost a full fifteen minutes and are best viewed from one of the boats in the harbor or surrounding hills.
After the display the celebrations usually last until dawn.
Locals love enjoying this day as itâ€™s also in the middle of their summer so the weather is always great! Unsurprisingly accommodation disappears fast so be sure to book well in advance if you want to spend the New Year down under! Check out my free travel guide to Sydney for more information on how to get there save money and enjoy the city when you visit! 3.
London London rings in the new year with an astonishing fireworks display thatâ€™s launched from the London Eye.
The fireworks can be seen from rooftops and balconies all across London so you donâ€™t need to leave your hotel to get a good view.
If you want to get out there and really experience the display the best views are from Westminster Bridge and the north embankment of the River Thames opposite the London Eye.
Check out my free travel guide to London for more information on what to see and do in London when you visit during the holiday! 4.
Paris Paris is the perfect destination for a romantic New Yearâ€™s Eve getaway.
It has high class dining clubbing fantastic fireworks and the chance to sip Champagne on the Champs-Elysees.
Around midnight you can watch the Eiffel Towerâ€™s light show.
Another great place to spend the evening is Montmartre as it offers spectacular views of the entire Paris skyline.
While you wonâ€™t get the same level of epic fireworks as you would in Sydney there are still great parties through the city and many people light off their own fireworks from the Champs-Elysees.
The city stays open late! Check out my travel guide to Paris for more information on spending New Yearâ€™s in Paris! It includes things to do see costs and how to get around! 5.
Ko Phangan Thailand Over 20000 young people cram on Haat Rin beach in Thailand to celebrate the New Year.
Backpackers and travelers from around the world dance paint themselves up and drink buckets of alcohol from dusk until the first dawn of the new year.
They fill the beach and itâ€™s one of the wildest outdoor parties there is on New Yearâ€™s.
If youâ€™re looking to start the new year on a beach and plan to be in Southeast Asia this is one of the best and most fun places to be.
Iâ€™ve spent three New Yearâ€™s here and loved every single one! Check out my travel guide to Ko Phangan for more information including information on the famous Full Moon Party.
6.
Kiribati What better way to ring in the New Year than to be the first person to do it? This spot in the Pacific is officially the first place in the world to see the New Year.
Itâ€™s like going into the future! Tourism here has picked up in recent years as the locals have tried to capitalize on that interesting fact but the island remains mostly an untouched getaway.
Thereâ€™s not much to do here and accommodation isnâ€™t by any means luxurious but what better way to spend the new year than on an island in the South Pacific? Be sure to plan this well in advance as few flights go here and limited accommodation makes its difficult to find spots.
7.
Tokyo If a single night of partying isnâ€™t enough for you head to Tokyo.
The capital city of Japan starts celebrating on the 29th of December giving you a few extra days to let loose and give the year a proper send-off.
Not only do they start early but the party almost doesnâ€™t stop.
New Yearâ€™s celebrations here continue until January 4th.
While most of the major tourist sites in the city are closed during this time the streets of Tokyo as well as all restaurants and clubs are packed with locals and visitors alike.
The city offers up numerous fireworks displays dancing and all the karaoke you can sing! Check out my travel guide to Tokyo for more information on what to do see and ways to save money.
8.
Las Vegas The city that parties every night throughout the year certainly knows how to throw a New Yearâ€™s Eve bash to remember.
There are so many clubs hotels bars and casinos to choose from in Las Vegas Nevada that itâ€™s almost impossible to not celebrate in style.
Outdoors The Stripâ€? is closed to traffic so everyone can watch the grand fireworks displays high above the cityâ€™s neon lights.
If you want to wade through the crowds make your way downtown to Fremont Street and join the massive block party complete with confetti a massive wine toast concerts by big-name rockers and a five-block-long illuminated canopy 90 feet overhead on which state-of-the-art sound and light shows are shown.
Check out my travel guide to Las Vegas for more information on enjoying life in Sin City without spending a sinful amount of money.
9.
San Juan Del Sur This holiday hotspot in Central America is a surfing and beach mecca for travelers of all ages and styles.
During New Years the city is bursting with tourists and locals who come from the surrounding area to enjoy time on the beach with their families and party hard Nicaraguans sure know how to have fun!.
This is definitely a place to go if youâ€™re looking to get bit crazy and then nurse your hangover on the beach the next day.
Thereâ€™s usually a giant beach party where locals and tourists mingle dance drink and countdown a new year together! 10.
Edinburgh When it comes to New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations Edinburgh is one of those places that canâ€™t be beat.
Their Hogmanay is one of the most fun parties Iâ€™ve ever been too.
Each year over 100000 people take part in the two-day celebration that involves a Viking procession fireworks over the castle bonfires concerts and a carnival.
Itâ€™s out of this world fun.
It gets super crowded and youâ€™ll need tickets to the shows so be sure to book in advance.
You can even walk the viking procession to the bonfire! Check out my travel guide to Edinburgh for more information on taking a holiday there.
BONUS 11.
Anywhere your friends are! No matter where you are in the world this holiday is about celebrating with friends and family.
Wherever they are will be the best place to celebrate.
Who wants to spend such a great day with strangers? Paris London New York a jungle the beach your home â€” it doesnâ€™t matter.
As long as you are with those you like and love it will be the best New Yearâ€™s party in the world.
**** New Years is an incredibly fun holiday where you can cut loose stay up late wash away the old and ring in the new.
If youâ€™re looking for the best places to celebrate new years eve in the world look no further than this list.
But remember no matter where you are so long as you are with people you enjoy youâ€™re in the best place to celebrate! Iâ€™ll be celebrating New Yearâ€™s Eve in Colombia so if youâ€™re down there say hi!

Boh-riiinnnng! Reply Julie December 29 2008 at 608 pm Valparaiso Chile is supposed to be incredible as well.
I was there a couple months ago and the word on the street is that the fireworks show over the large bay is the best in the world! Because the city is surrounded by hills you should be able to get some great views.

Clearly I need to do the rest.
Happy almost New Year! Reply Erica December 30 2008 at 1144 pm Another great post.
So far London is my favorite city to spend New Yearâ€™s Eve but I really want to experience NYE in New York Paris Vegas and Sydney in the future.
But I must agree just like Christmas celebrating with people you love is more important than where you are.
Reply Angela Nickerson December 31 2008 at 521 am Tomorrow I am blogging about ringing in the new year in Rome â€” another fabulous place to be.
This year I am in Philly.
I have a group of friends who gather every New Years.
It is a long-standing tradition and it doesnâ€™t matter where we are so long as we are together.
Happy New Year! ð?™‚ Reply Juan Perez December 31 2008 at 610 am And what about Prague..? o Happy New Year 2009â€¦ Reply Talia Clare December 31 2008 at 320 am This is an absolutely fabulous article.
I am now inspired to actually make something of New Years whereas before I never really celebrated.
Christmas was usually enough but now I want more.
Thanks for writing this and thanks for the incredible pictures.
Reply Celine December 31 2008 at 854 am Hi Matt Iâ€™ve enjoyed â€“ or endured the freezing cold of â€“ a New Yearâ€™s Eve at Times Square a few years back.
It was crazy but incredibly exciting.
Dropped in to wish you a happy New Year and may 2009 bring in peace joy and lifeâ€™s best to you.
Happy Travels.
Reply Linda December 31 2008 at 910 am Great list though Iâ€™m not impressed at the dig at New Zealand we have cities of over a million people! Well we have one.
Iâ€™m surprised you didnâ€™t include Edinburgh â€“ itâ€™s regarded by many as THE place to be at New Yearâ€™s or Hogmanay as they call it in Scotland.
Thereâ€™s a huge party and fantastic fireworks not to mention heaps of guys wandering around in kilts.
Reply Linda December 31 2008 at 913 am Juan I think Prague is better for Christmas.

Hope 2010 brings all the best things in life! Reply Kerry January 1 2010 at 948 am It doesnâ€™t really surprise me that many would claim their cities and country as the first funny though that New Zealand has the first major cities in the world that greet the New Year it may not be as BIG as Australia since you believe over population to be a criteria for being bestowed this honour but us Kiwis love our lush open spaces and striking scenic beauty so feel free to claim the New Year as being your first! we here in NZ know who getâ€™s to welcome it in first and are happy to stand aside have a beer and laugh at the rest of the wannabes!!! Reply Kevin January 1 2010 at 424 pm Paris isreally boring with new years eve.
This year no fireworks at all at the Champs and the Eiffel Tower.
itâ€™s really horrible to be here in Paris ..
Reply Roel January 2 2010 at 1113 am Paris is a great city but indeed now fireworks this year.
The atmosphere was OK but I expected more.
Anyway I had a great time with my girlfriend.
Next year another city probably.
Reply Antonio June 27 2010 at 1030 am ANYWHERE people are allowed to purchase firecrackers on the streets and light them up themselves! Iâ€™m from the Philippines where its literallly a WAR ZONE during New Year with firecrackers exploding left and right and up in the air and on the ground!.
There is NO better way to do it! And public Fireworks displays are BORING! ð?˜€ Reply Lesley August 5 2010 at 1047 am really people get a grip.
Edinburgh Scotland Reply dan October 2 2010 at 312 am What about taiwan? 2nd worlds tallest buildingby like 3 feet and more fireworks shot off of it that you could ever believe Reply Benn December 29 2010 at 938 pm Berlin and Edinburgh have massive celebrations with huge parties and would certainly sit in my top 10 of cities to visit for NYE celebrations.
Reply Allen Trottier December 30 2010 at 239 am Times Square for New Years Eve would be crazy.
Iâ€™d like to do it at least once.
Reply Steve Gordon October 27 2011 at 814 am I am from the U.S.
and Iâ€™ve been to NYC and L.V.
nice list btw but Iâ€™m suprised the Rio de Janeiro didnâ€™t make the list! If you are into travel you have got to experience it.
Reply Nidhin November 18 2011 at 847 am I was wanting to go a different place other than goaIndia for this NYEâ€¦.
From what I have heard Sri-Lanka is a great place to party and at the same time it will not pinch your wallets ð?™‚ For those of youâ€™ll wanting to try out new places than the aforementioned my suggestion would strongly be Goa or Sri-Lanka.
Reply Helen December 14 2016 at 147 am Edinburgh really is the home of NYE celebrations.
Scotland loves NYE so much there is even a special name for it Hogmanay! London doesnâ€™t come close to the street parties in Edinburgh.
If you havenâ€™t been to Edinburgh for Hogmanay Matt then I suggest that could be a plan for next year! Reply Helen December 14 2016 at 342 am Matt I just read the post about your visit to Hogmanay 2014.
It is a great reflection of the vibrancy of this event.
Glad you got a chance to experience it.
Having moved from Scotland to Australia I will miss Hogmanay but I am looking forward to going to Sydney for NYE at some point.
Reply Owen Lloyd November 21 2018 at 644 am Iâ€™ll be in Ljubljana I believe this New Year hope itâ€™ll be great! Love the post man great content as usual.
If anyone is down check out my blog content at theroamingman.com Thanks! Reply George November 24 2018 at 1006 pm Great list! I know that everybody is proposing a place I thought of adding Athens celebrating NYE in Acropolis is quite something! Reply Oscar Brumel November 25 2018 at 1246 pm Wow Thanks for the tip about Edinburgh! Iâ€™ve been there countless times and I had no idea that they like to put up a show on the new years eve.
Might go there this year who knows! The tickets are always cheap to Scotland from where I live.
Aside from that I wanted to thank you for your book on how to travel the world for 50$ a day.
Last month I completed it and I must say that it was an awesome read.
Reply Pete Rojwongsuriya November 27 2018 at 1106 pm For me itâ€™s definitely being back home in Bangkok where the weather is much cooler now excellent for doing outdoor activities which is not easy to do in a place like Bangkok and best of all the city is empty because all the locals go to either the north or the south to celebrate which means it is the only time of year Bangkok is free of the dreaded traffic! The quiet empty Bangkok is the best.
ð?™‚ Reply Mark Gwilliam December 6 2018 at 833 pm Ouchâ€¦as a Kiwi Auckland surely warrants being called a major city! ð?™‚ Apart from that I loved your post Matt.
Iâ€™m looking forward to being first to see 2019 from Aucklandâ€™s beautiful harbour and waterfront! Reply Oliver October 9 2019 at 629 pm Hi Matt.
My wife and I really want to celebrate the New Year in Paris.
But I didnâ€™t fully understand everything will work on holidays? And what about booking how early do you need to book everything? Thanks for the answer.
Reply Tommy Berg December 27 2019 at 144 am Wow I totally missed Edinburgh.
The medieval styled old town people and cultureâ€¦ I should plan a trip next year with my wife to re-live the moments again.
ð?™‚ Reply Robert Harris April 22 2020 at 215 am Great article Matt! New York is definitely one of the best places to spend your New Yearâ€™s Eve! Apart from the ball drop at Times Sqaure the fireworks at the Central Park and at the Grand Army Plaza are also amazing.
