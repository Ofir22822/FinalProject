New year new youâ€? starts with the best intentions but after a couple of months itâ€™s back to new year old you.
Old habits die hard but they can be broken if they are replaced with good ones.
Weâ€™re at the start of a new year and decade so â€” as someone who loves a good clichÃ© â€” Iâ€™m going to use this time to build the habits that create a better version of me.
After many years of trying and writing copious and annoying blog posts about it last year I finally slowed my travels and moved to Austin.
I have a furnished apartment plants only two have died so far! and a recently purchased car my first ever!.
My days are filled with routine.
I wake up make breakfast head to WeWork go to the gym head home read cook dinner read some more and go to bed.
My life is the proverbial suburban 9-to-5 I tried to escape from for so many years.
And for the first January in years Iâ€™m not on the road.
Iâ€™ve been enjoying it so much Iâ€™ve even begun to dread heading to the airport the same way children dread the dentist.
I used to think routine was a bad thing.
It was the thing that killed spontaneity and adventure.
But Iâ€™ve come to learn that routine actually creates the framework for excitement and adventure.
By scheduling my days and following a routine I can ensure that I make time for whatâ€™s important and for all the things I want to do and goals I hope to accomplish.
So I wrote a list of things to do this year called Stop Being Boringâ€? with all the things I want to do while in Austin this year get out more volunteer attend city council meetings first one is next month! join some social clubs to meet new people host more meet-ups and explore more of the city.
Now that I have a car I also plan to see more of Texas and the American South.
Rather than try to read more Iâ€™m going to be a reader.
Rather than try to go to the gym Iâ€™m going to be the person that does.
While Iâ€™ve already made some good strides toward eating better and going to the gym the true test will be when I start traveling in February.
Will I fall back into old habits? Maybe.
But Iâ€™m motivated to break them.
This year is also going to be all about focus for me.
I want to focus on work without getting sidetracked by phone calls or Facebook so I can end my workday earlier.
The internet makes it easy to stretch it from four productive hours to ten unproductive ones especially when you work for yourself.
Now Iâ€™m already sitting undistracted from my tasks and getting them done quicker! Next month Iâ€™m going to Hawaii and Taiwan for three weeks before heading back to Paris and Berlin.
In the summer when the weather in Austin is too unbearable Iâ€™m thinking about the Balkans and maybe some of the â€™Stans in the fall.
And then in November Iâ€™d like to finally get to Peru.
And while Iâ€™ll travel less this year what trips I do take will be done with more focus.
As they say whatâ€™s old is new again and this year Iâ€™m going to travel without my computer again.
Last year all my travels were just a backdrop for work â€” and thatâ€™s not how I want to see the world.
*** Study after study has shown that by imagining yourself as your desired self you unconsciously start acting like that person.
Iâ€™m determined to make new year new meâ€? last the full year.
And if I donâ€™t youâ€™re free to remind me of this post and hold me accountable! So thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been up to these last few quiet months.
What are your goals for the new year? Book Your Trip to Austin Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.
They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld.
If you want to stay elsewhere use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
Donâ€™t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.
Itâ€™s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.
I never go on a trip without it as Iâ€™ve had to use it many times in the past.
Iâ€™ve been using World Nomads for ten years.
My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are World Nomads for everyone below 70 Insure My Trip for those over 70 Looking for the best companies to save money with?

Congratulations on all of your achievements! Bless you on your plans and goals in life! Thank you for being an inspiration.
? Reply Amy M January 23 2020 at 1136 am Itâ€™s definitely easier to keep yourself accountable weekly/monthly than it is yearly.
My last resolution was to finish the things Iâ€™d started I have about three books that Iâ€™ve started writing and I got about halfway through it.
This yearâ€™s resolution is to continue with that and finish the remainder whilst *trying* not to start any other lengthy stuff! Best of luck with achieving yours.
PSâ€”if you need workout ideas for when youâ€™re on the road Joe Wicks the Bodycoach has some great youtube videos for HITT workouts which can be done in hotel rooms etc and donâ€™t need any equipment.
Reply Casey Griffin January 23 2020 at 934 pm Youâ€™re coming back to Taiwan! When will you be here? Will you be doing a meet-up or anything like that while youâ€™re here? I live in Taiwan and Iâ€™d love to go to something like that! Reply Renuka January 24 2020 at 1248 am Routine actually creates the framework for excitement and adventure.â€? This is the key thing.
I love this.
Iâ€™m also someone who dreads the mundane things of life.
However I have resolved to enjoy all the mundane things and small things of everyday life.
I have come to realize that following a routine every day makes your life more rewarding and much more exciting in the long run.
Reply Veronika Primm January 24 2020 at 1108 am That sounds exciting Matt.
So youâ€™re going to do most of the out-of-routine activities on weekends? I enjoy having a nice routine too while escaping the harsh European winter to a Thai island ð?™‚ Lifeâ€™s good and Iâ€™m so much more productive! Fingers crossed that you kick a** this year! See you maybe on one of the many blogger conferences Iâ€™m not going to TBEX or ITB this year though.
Reply NomadicMatt January 24 2020 at 357 pm Come to TravelCon! Thatâ€™s our baby! Reply Emilia Cruickshank January 24 2020 at 1000 pm Hey Matt Something made me pick up your book in the library the other day and Iâ€™m so glad I didâ€™ Love it! Love you! Canâ€™t wait to hit the road again.
Cheers Emilia Reply Allison January 28 2020 at 416 pm I love to travel but I also really like routine! Which is why when I was reading your book I was like â€˜I want to do that!â€™ but I also really like having a steady paycheck and I own my apartment and have two cats so thatâ€™s kinda keeping me in one place NYC so itâ€™s not so bad .
Your book DID make me want to find some way to take a month or two and travel at some point though! I did right after college for a month.
Reply Jesse Larson February 15 2020 at 623 pm Oh man I loved reading this.
I traveled nearly non-stop for 8 or so years and had no home base.
Now Iâ€™m in a relationship with a guy who goes to school and works in Santa Fe NM.
This is the first time in YEARS that Iâ€™ve actually had a place to call home and I have to say I really love it! I still travel as often as I can of course.
Since my boyfriend loves to travel too we have been taking off for the entire summer and then doing as many mini-trips throughout the rest of the year as possible.
But when we are home it feels so good to be able to get into little routines and actually have a gym membership and be able to cook my own dinner every night! Iâ€™m so excited and curious to see how you end up liking Austin which is a place Iâ€™ve always wanted to go to but never made it to and hear more about how youâ€™re creating the right balance between travel and home life!
