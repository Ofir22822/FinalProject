Hello all you YANKS! This is what my good AUSSIE friend Kirsty calls me...I think it is so funny! As you all might known this is a STUDY abroad experience.
Here goes the STUDY part about my trip...
Classes started on the 21st of February.
I am taking 4 classes Colonial Australian History Theatre and Performing Philosophy and Orientation to Coaching an exercise class! also so I can understand what Joe is doing with his life goals.
There is your shout out Joe!! There are very different set ups of the classes than in the US.
For example for each class there are lectures and tutorials.
For my theatre class I even have a workshop class.
The lectures are typical classes in the U.S.
but this is WITHOUT questions and not much interaction between the student and professor.
They would like you to save your questions for the tutorials.
My tutorials range between 6-16 student per class.
Since it is smaller the professor can explain topics to your specific needs.
I REALLY like this system.
I am very shy to ask questions in front of a large group but when Im in my tutorial I feel much more comfortable speaking Petersons Winery up! For the most part classes are going really well.
There is much more reading and papers assigned at UNE than at Lock Haven.
I am most nervous about Philosophy and History but I think in the long run Ill be alright! This past weekend our good friend Preet took us to some of the local wineries! It was a blast! The weather was perfect and the area was so pretty.
The wineries were only about 20 minutes away from Uni so the drive wasnt bad at all.
It was fun to taste test some locally grown wine and enjoy the day with friends! Since Chelsea Heather and I AND MOST PEOPLE AT UNE dont have any Friday classes our friends Tom and Piers are taking us to the beach this weekend!!! Tom lives in Port Macquarie which is a very touristy beach town.
The drive will take about 4 hours but Im SOO excited!! Maybe this will be my chance to learn how to surf! We also might be able to meet up with Kirsty this weekend.
She is heading home for her Mums birthday! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MUM!! She lives about 40 minutes away from where Petersons Winery Heather Chelsea and I! we will be staying! It would be heaps of fun if we could get together with her! I hope everyone has a great weekend!!
