Neuschwanstein is known all over the world as a symbol of idealised romantic architecture and for the tragic story of its owner.
After losing sovereignty in his own kingdom Ludwig II withdrew into his own world of myths legend and fairytales.
Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Neuschwanstein Castle in southern Bavaria is without doubt one of the most frequently photographed sights in Germany.
Ludwig IIs ambitious project begun in 1869 united aspects of Wartburg Castle with those attributed to the Castle of the Holy Grail from Wagners Parsifal.
For Ludwig Neuschwanstein was primarily a retreat.
After ascending the Bavarian throne in 1864 he was forced to cede power to the Prussians just two years later which left him with a hatred of the royal seat of Munich.
To compensate he devoted more and more of his time to the fine arts.
After his sovereignty was taken away he withdrew into his own world of myths legend and fairytales.
Among the castles finest rooms are two magnificent halls.
One of these the Singers Hall is a larger and more exquisite version of the same room in the Wartburg and also incorporates elements from the medieval castles banqueting hall â€“ though it never echoed to the sound of singing or festivities.
The double-storey throne room reaches fifteen metres in height and is encircled by galleries on both floors.
Its extravagant decorations dazzle in gold and blue.
Ludwigs great passion however was for the Hall of the Holy Grail in which he united his nostalgia for the Middle Ages with the latest technology of the time.
The king even chose to wallow in the Middle Ages at mealtimes â€“ his dining room is a veritable shrine to the minnesingers contest at Wartburg Castle.
Ludwigs sleeping quarters show a clear Gothic influence and are even embellished with details referencing Wagners operas.
The dressing table has a swan-shaped tap inspired by Lohengrin.
Another well-known feature of Neuschwanstein is the grotto whose little waterfalls and coloured lighting create the impression of a mysterious cave.
Excursions to neo-Gothic Hohenschwangau Castle which was rebuilt from 12th century ruins in 1832 and to the Roman bath at Mount Tegelberg are also recommended.
