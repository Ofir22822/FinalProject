The fine Museo Taurino is also here and the architecture will be of interest even to those with no interest in las corridas bullfights.
Bullfights are still held regularly here during the season which runs roughly mid-May to September.

It was opened in 1931 and hosted its first fight three years later its four storeys can seat 25000 spectators.
Like all bullrings it evokes more a sense of a theatre than a sports stadium.
It also hosts concerts.
To be carried high on the shoulders of aficionados out through the grand and decidedly Moorish Puerta de Madrid is the ultimate dream of any torero bullfighter â€“ if youâ€™ve made it at Las Ventas youâ€™ve reached the pinnacle of the bullfighting world.
The gate is suitably known more colloquially as the â€˜Gate of Gloryâ€™.
Guided visits in English and Spanish take you out onto the sand and into the royal box tours must be booked in advance through Las Ventas Tour.
The recently renovated Museo Taurino contains a new space dedicated to bullfighting legend Manolete as well as a curious collection of paraphernalia costumes the traje de luces or suit of lights is one of bullfightingâ€™s most recognisable props photos and other bullfighting memorabilia up on the top floor above one of the two courtyards by the ring.
Its a fascinating insight into the whole subculture that surrounds bullfighting.
The area where the Plaza de Toros is located is known as Las Ventas because in times gone by several wayside taverns ventas along with houses of ill repute were to be found here.
