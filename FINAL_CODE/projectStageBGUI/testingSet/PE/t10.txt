Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner This wild and untamed national park in Thuringia is located in the southern part of the Eichsfeld-Hainich-Werra Valley Nature Park.
It is situated between the spa town of Bad Langensalza and the Wartburg Castle town of Eisenach.
In winter the best way to appreciate the beauty of the landscape is to take a sleigh ride.
In spring and autumn the Rennsteig Trail and other well-marked footpaths are popular with walkers.
High above the forest floor At Hainich National Park you can be king of the forest.
The treetop trail at Thiemsburg national park centre takes you up to a height of 44 metres above parts of the forest that would be virtually inaccessible from the ground.
A rendezvous with wildcats Another highlight is the HÃ¼tscheroda Wildcat Village where you can watch the wildcats having breakfast in a clearing in the forest.
You can also enjoy breathtaking views of the RhÃ¶n hills Wartburg Castle and the Thuringian Forest from a 17-metre-high platform.
The wildcats barn provides fascinating facts on the local flora and fauna.
Walking amid ancient trees A whole host of discovery trails showcase the beauty of the region.
And if youve ever wanted to see a thousand-year-old tree simply follow the Rennsteig to the ancient Betteleiche oak.
