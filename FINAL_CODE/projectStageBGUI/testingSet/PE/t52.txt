With one arm reaching out to Asia and the other to Europe Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents.
The Bosphorus courses the waters of the Black Sea the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn through the citys heart.
Istanbuls fate has been sealed by its vital strategic location and its enchanting natural beauty.
For more than 1500 years it was the capital of three empires Roman Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires.
It was beautified accordingly with magnificent monuments and became a metropolis where diverse cultures nations and religions mingled.
Those cultures nations and religions are the small pieces that form the mosaic of Istanbul.
Istanbuls most important building works started in the Byzantine period and the city was then embellished further during the days of the Ottoman Empire.
Modern and Traditional Together It is Istanbuls endless variety that fascinates its visitors.
The museums churches palaces grand mosques bazaars and sites of natural beauty are countless.
As relaxing on the western shores of the Bosphorus at sunset and watching the red evening light reflected on the other continent you may suddenly and profoundly understand why so many centuries ago settlers chose to build a city on this remarkable site.
At such times you can see why Istanbul is truly one of the most glorious cities in the world.
Istanbul is Turkeys most developed and largest city with the latest discoveries indicating that the history of human habitation there goes back some 400000 years.
The purple years of Istanbul may have started in 330 when Emperor Constantine declared the city the capital of his empire â€“ royal purple is the colour of the Byzantine imperial family.
Until 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottomans the city served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire.
During the reign of the Byzantines Istanbul was adorned with a number of great monuments which made it the most magnificent city in the world even during the declining years of the empire.
Striking Multireligious Identity The identity of Istanbul that began with the Byzantines was further shaped during the period of the Ottoman Empire.
Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror declared Istanbul the capital of Ottoman Empire after he conquered the city in 1453.
Over the next 450 years the city was adorned with superb Ottoman monuments.
Building works after the conquest gathered apace during the reign of Sultan Bayezid II with the finest works built by Mimar Sinan the Chief Royal Architect.
This worldfamous architect put his signature on the silhouette of Istanbul with a number of masterpieces.
The Ottomans were tolerant towards all religions and dedicated many places of worship to the Christian and Jewish communities so that these peoples could practise their religion undisturbed.
Thus in Istanbul mosques churches and synagogues stood and still stand side by side as the physical evidence of Istanbul and a symbol of tolerance and fraternity of religions.
GLORIOUS TREASURES As an imperial capital of 1500 years Istanbul is rich in architectural monuments reflecting its past splendour.
At every turn in the city one can happen upon Roman Byzantine and Ottoman palaces mosques churches monasteries monuments walls and ruins.
