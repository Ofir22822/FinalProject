The UKs Guardian newspaper once crowned it the worlds best road trip.
For a highway that is barely 8km long the weight of expectation may be too great but its certainly hugely scenic.
During the autumn storms youll experience natures wrath at its most dramatic.
In season look out for whales and seals offshore.
Details Visit website You can do the road in either direction from Molde hit the coast at Bud from Kristiansund and the north take the new undersea road tunnel that connects with Bremsnes.
Whichever your direction rather than driving the Rv64 which cuts across inland AverÃ¸ya choose the quieter prettier road signed for Kvernes which loops around the islands southern coast and takes no longer.
Several scenic overlooks are stationed along the route with striking structures built as part of the Nasjonaleturistvegen project which aims to promote 18 of Norways scenic roads and enhance them with cutting-edge architecture.
Key stops include the rest area and walking path at EldhusÃ¸ya an island off the southwest of AverÃ¸ya and the glass-fronted viewing platform at AskevÃ¥gen a little over 10km north of Bud which gives you a 360-degree panoramic view of the archipelago the ocean and the shore.
The most impressive â€“ and longest â€“ bridge is Storseisund a gravity-defying marvel that seems to curl and twist on its way from Eide to AverÃ¸y island.
Its starred in umpteen car advertisements.
You dont necessarily need your own car to follow the road although it does make it a lot more fun.
Eide Auto buses link Molde and Kristiansund year-round.
There are five daily buses from Monday to Friday two on Saturday and one on Sunday.
Its a 2Â¼ hour return trip although if you buy the day ticket you can hop on and off at will.
