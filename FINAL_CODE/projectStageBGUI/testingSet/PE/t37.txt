While the collection concentrates on Pablo Picassos formative years â€“ potentially disappointing lovers of his better-known later works â€“ there is enough material from subsequent periods to showcase the artists versatility and genius.
Above all you come away feeling that Picasso was the true original always one step ahead of himself let alone anyone else in his search for new forms of expression.

The 18th-century Casa Mauri built over medieval remains even some Roman leftovers have been identified and the adjacent 14th-century Palau Finestres accommodate temporary exhibitions.
The elegant courtyards galleries and staircases preserved in the first three buildings are as delightful as the collection inside.
The collection which includes more than 3500 artworks is strongest on Picassoâ€™s earliest years up until 1904 which is apt considering that the artist spent his formative creative years in Barcelona.
Allegedly it was Picasso himself who proposed the museums creation in 1960 to his friend and personal secretary Jaume SabartÃ©s a Barcelona native.
Three years later the SabartÃ©s Collection was opened since a museum bearing Picassoâ€™s name would have been met with censorship â€“ Picassos opposition to the Franco regime was well known.
The Museu Picasso we see today opened in 1983.
It originally held only SabartÃ©s personal collection of Picassos art and a handful of other works but the collection gradually expanded with donations from Salvador DalÃ­ and SebastiÃ  Junyer Vidal among others.
However the largest part of the present collection came from Picasso himself.
His widow Jacqueline Roque also donated 41 ceramic pieces and the Woman with Bonnet painting after Picassos death.
SabartÃ©s contribution is honoured with Picassos famous Blue Period portrait of him wearing a ruff room B1.
What makes this collection truly impressive â€“ one-of-a-kind among the worlds many Picasso museums â€“ is the way in which it displays Picassos extraordinary talent at such a young age.
A visit starts with sketches and oils from his earliest years in MÃ¡laga and A CoruÃ±a 1893 to 1895.
Some of his self-portraits and the portraits of his parents which date from 1896 are evidence enough of his precocious talent.
Retrato de la tÃ­a Pepa Portrait of Aunt Pepa room 2 done in MÃ¡laga in 1896 shows the incredible maturity of his brushstrokes and his ability to portray character â€“ at the tender age of 15.
Picasso painted the enormous CiÃ¨ncia i caritat Science and Charity room 3 in the same year showcasing his masterful academic techniques of portraiture.
His ingeniousness extends to his models too with his father standing in for the doctor and a beggar whom he hired off the street along with her offspring modelling the sick woman and the child.
This painting caused the young artist to be noticed in the higher echelons of Spains art world when CiÃ¨ncia i caritat was awarded an Honorary Mention at the General Fine Arts Exhibition in Madrid in 1897.
In rooms 5 to 7 hang paintings from his first Paris sojourn while room 8 is dedicated to the first significant new stage in his development the Blue Period.
Woman with Bonnet is an important work from this period depicting a detainee from the Saint-Lazare womens prison and venereal disease hospital that Picasso visited when in Paris â€“ this also sets up the theme of Picassos fascination with those inhabiting the down-and-out layers of society.
His nocturnal blue-tinted views of Terrats de Barcelona Roofs of Barcelona room 8 and El foll The Madman often on loan are cold and cheerless yet somehow alive.
Terrats de Barcelona was painted during his second stint at the 17 Carrer de la Riera Sant Joan studio in 1903 â€“ he painted the city rooftops frequently from different perspectives in this period.
A few cubist paintings pop up in rooms 10 and 11 check the Glass and Tobacco Packet still-life painting a beautiful and simple work.
Picasso started to experiment with still life in 1924 â€“ something hed done before but had not taken to as seriously as he would from here on.
From 1954 to 1962 Picasso was obsessed with the idea of researching and â€˜rediscoveringâ€™ the greats in particular VelÃ¡zquez.
In 1957 he made a series of renditions of VelÃ¡zquez masterpiece Las Meninas The Ladies-in-Waiting now displayed in rooms 12 to 14.
It is as though Picasso has looked at the original VelÃ¡zquez painting through a prism reflecting all the styles he had worked through until then creating his own masterpiece in the process.
This is a wonderful opportunity to see Las meninas in its entirety in a beautiful space.
What is also special about the Museu Picasso is its showcasing of his work in lesser-known media.
The last rooms contain Picassos engravings and 42 ceramic pieces completed throughout the latter years of his unceasingly creative life.
Youll see plates and bowls decorated with simple single-line drawings of fish owls and other animal shapes typical for Picassos daubing on clay.
Room 16 meanwhile displays portraits of Jacqueline from the 1960s.
