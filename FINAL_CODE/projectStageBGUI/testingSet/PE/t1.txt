No matter where you come from its said that everyone should make at least one trip to experience Edinburghs Hogmanay.
Maybe its the fact that Edinburghs party lasts for three days instead of just one.
Or perhaps its because of the sheer range of entertainment and fun on offer in a city already world-famous for its year-round selection of festivals.
It could be the unique atmosphere generated by the huge crowd of welcome guests and friendly Edinburghers packed into the historic city centre.
And dont forget the gasp-inducing sight of the outrageously good fireworks filling the sky with light and noise high above the turrets of Edinburgh Castle.
Torchlight Procession Whatever strange chemistry it is that brings together music tradition energy history vikings and fun it seems to work with sellout crowds year after year.
And yes we did say vikings! Each year the Up Helly Aa Vikings travel from Shetland by longboat probably to take their place at the head of the opening event of Edinburghs Hogmanay the Torchlight Procession.
The procession takes place on 30 December and its truly a stunning sight to behold as celebrations get underway.
Thousands of torch bearers march through the cityâ€™s ancient streets through the Old Town parts of which date back to at least the 14th century.
They then go further downhill towards the Palace of Holyrood House.
Meanwhile tens of thousands of spectators line the pavements for a spectacular finale of lights music and fireworks cheering the walkers on as they create a river of fire through from streets to Holyrood Park.
And thats just the first night! Music to suit all tastes Mere hours later comes New Years Eve or Hogmanay as its better known in Scotland when the party truly reaches its peak.
Stages carefully positioned throughout the city centre offer a diverse range of musical entertainment options from indie rock to traditional Celtic music and from DJs and dancers to jazz blues and more.
Up in the Old Town the stunning St Giles Cathedral hosts a candlelit classical concert.
Down in Princes Street Gardens theres a stage devoted entirely to the ceilidh tradition with thousands enjoying the chance to learn about and take part in wild Scottish dancing.
Edinburgh Castle overlooks the celebrations from high above.
Also in Princes Street Gardens is the centrepiece event of Edinburghs Hogmanay the Concert in the Gardens.
Major acts such as Franz Ferdinand Rag nBone Man Biffy Clyro Lily Allen and Soul II Soul have all rocked revellers who are lucky enough to grab a ticket.
New Years Eve fireworks And after all that dancing the Gardens is one of the best places to catch the magnificent fireworks bursting high above the majestic castle and its ancient volcanic rock.
The illuminations can be seen for miles around of course but its quite something to find yourself immediately beneath those dramatic eruptions of light and sound at midnight and at the smaller hourly displays in the lead up to the big moment.
And at midnight for all the choice of entertainment across the city centre whether you came for the big names the traditional culture the party atmosphere or the fantastic fireworks in that one moment the crowds join as one to sing the worlds biggest rendition of Auld Lang Syne in a show of togetherness and friendship.
And then the bands start up again and the party carries on into the wee small hours! Swim in the River Forth But wait theres more...
Edinburghs Hogmanay isnt done with you just yet.
If youre feeling bold on the first day of January maybe you can shake off the rigours of the night before as one of the hardy souls taking part in the Loony Dook a street parade of costumed thrill-seekers culminating in a freezing cold plunge into the icy waters of the River Forth.
If youre less keen on feeling the chill you can still cheer the Dookers on as they walk through the town of South Queensferry just a few miles west of Edinburgh and take a dip in the shadow of the famous Forth Bridge.
Book your tickets For those who have felt the glare of the fiery torches who have danced to the music gasped at the fireworks sung till their voices hurt and defied the cold of the river this is one final chance to bid farewell to the year just gone and welcome the next in the company of friends old and new.
There really is nothing quite like Edinburghs Hogmanay.
