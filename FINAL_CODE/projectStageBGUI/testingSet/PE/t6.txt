Completed in 1936 after eight years of labour the Trolls Ladder is a stunning feat of road building spiralling up the mountainside through 11 hairpin bends and a 112 gradient and after heavy rain waterfalls cascade down the mountainside drenching cars as they pass.
To add to the thrill much of it is effectively single-lane meaning traffic jams and passing vehicles are part of the hair-raising experience.

Teetering precipitously over the plunging cliff and allowing stomach-churning views right down the mountain the site was designed by top architect Reiulf Ramstad and has become one of the most famous locations on the National Tourist Route network dont miss it.
The road can be done in either direction from Valldal or Andalsnes a distance of about 38km.
The road passes through Reinheimen National Park established in 2006 and Norways third largest where wild reindeer still crop the mosses and soft grass.
The pass is usually cleared and open from late May to mid-October although its entirely dependent on the seasonal snowfall.
