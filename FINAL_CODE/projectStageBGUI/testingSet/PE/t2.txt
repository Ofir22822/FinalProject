From its unmissable gothic cathedral to the maze of medieval streets weâ€™ve managed to whittle down the list to just 10.
If you are planning to spend a few days we recommend a York Pass which will save you money on entry to many of the citys attractions.
1.
Get a gargoyleâ€™s-eye view of York Thrusting up from Yorkâ€™s maze of ancient streets are the 3 muscular towers of York Minster the largest gothic building in Britain.
The cathedral you see today was begun in 1220 took around 250 years to finish and is now widely considered to be one of Europeâ€™s finest medieval buildings.
Highlights here include some of the oldest and most beautiful stained-glass windows in Britain the East Window is the largest area of medieval stained glass in a single window in the world and the crypt containing some of the original 11th-century church.
But itâ€™s the heady 275-step hike to the top of the Central Tower thatâ€™s the real show-stopper here.
Catch your breath and take in the gargoyleâ€™s-eye view of Yorkshire spread out below just as breathless visitors have done for the last 600 years.
2.
Go back in time at a Victorian prison If youâ€™ve ever wondered what life might have been like 200 years ago York Castle Museum can enlighten you.
Experience the sights and sounds of 18th-century York on a wonderfully recreated Victorian street before exploring the museumâ€™s other social history exhibits covering topics from World War I to 1960s pop culture.
The museum is housed in a former prison but gets its name from the fact it stands on the site of a castle built by William the Conqueror.
Located in central York entry is free with a York Pass.
3.
Go trainspotting The awesome scale slick lines and steam-powered appeal of the locomotives housed at the National Railway Museum are enough to turn even the coolest observer into a fervent trainspotter.
The vast treasures in the cavernous halls include the only Bullet Train outside Japan Queen Victoriaâ€™s â€˜palace on wheelsâ€™ and the achingly beautiful Duchess of Hamilton a 1930s art deco triumph of design and engineering.
Open every day entry is free.
4.
Visit one of the worldâ€™s greatest mansions Named One of the Worlds Top Ten Greatest Mansions and Grand Houses by Lonely Planet Castle Howard is definitely worth the short bus journey from York city.
Like stumbling on to the set of a period drama the magnificent 18th-century mansion set amid lush gardens and rolling hills has been the backdrop to many a film and costumed TV show.
Thereâ€™s much to explore here along with its movie-star past after marvelling at the dramatic interiors and world-renowned art collection you can wander the acres of parkland dotted with lakes and temples leaving time for tea and cake in the quaint cafÃ©.
Entry is free with a York Pass.
5.
See hear and smell a Viking settlement Buckle up for a rollicking journey back through time to the days when raiders from the north had colonised 10th-century York.
See hear and even smell a Viking settlement complete with blacksmith bedrooms and a historically accurate Viking toilet.
Jorvik Viking Centre is a fine mix of history and fun that brings some of the astonishingly well-preserved objects excavated from beneath the city to life.
If you fancy a more hands-on approach to history donâ€™t miss DIG the attraction that lets you play archaeologist.
6.
Enjoy a traditional high tea Youve climbed the central tower of York Minster youâ€™ve been wowed by the steam behemoths at the National Railway Museum and you may even have seen a genuine Viking lavatory.
So by now youve probably earned a cup of tea.
And the place to have it has to be Betty Tea Rooms a Yorkshire institution serving delicious pastries cakes and restorative tea in gorgeous surroundings unchanged since the 1930s.
Decked out by the same craftsmen who fitted out the Queen Mary ocean liner a cup of tea here is a luxurious experience not to be missed.
7.
Taste your way through chocolate history One of Yorkâ€™s newer attractions is also its sweetest.
Chocolate has been made in the city for 300 years and York was once home to 2 of the worldâ€™s big chocolate brands â€“ Rowntreeâ€™s and Terryâ€™s.
Iconic chocs from Aero to Smarties and the mighty Kit Kat began life here so itâ€™s a fine place to learn about the chocolate-making process from bean to bar.
At Chocolate â€“ Yorks Sweet Story youll taste your way through chocolate history discover generations of confectionery secrets and end your tour in the Chocolate Bar to enjoy such extravagances as an All Day Chocolate Breakfast and an Ultimate Chocolate Fondue.
8.
Ramble down The Shambles Lying at the heart of a warren of old twisting lanes is The Shambles one of the best preserved medieval streets in Europe.
Its origins are so old it was once mentioned in the Doomsday Book while the overhanging timber-framed houses that still stand today are a remarkable reminder of the cityâ€™s past.
Now the picturesque buildings are filled with quaint cafes and shops selling everything from sweets to handmade soaps.
