As the royal fine arts academy it has nurtured local talent thereby complementing the royal penchant for drawing the great international artists of the day into their realm.
The pantheon of former alumni reads like a whoâ€™s who of Spanish art and the collection that now hangs on the academyâ€™s walls is a suitably rich one.

Nonetheless a visit here is a fascinating journey into another age of art when we tell you that Picasso and DalÃ­ studied at this academy long the academic centre of learning for up-and-coming artists but found it far too stuffy for their liking youâ€™ll get an idea of what to expect.
A centre of excellence since Fernando VI founded the academy in the 18th century it remains a stunning repository of works by some of the best-loved old masters.
The 1st floor mainly devoted to 16th- to 19th-century paintings is the most noteworthy of those in the academic gallery.
Among relative unknowns you come across a hall of works by ZurbarÃ¡n especially arresting is the series of full-length portraits of white-cloaked friars and a San JerÃ³nimo by El Greco.
At a â€˜forkâ€™ in the exhibition a sign points right to rooms 11 to 16 the main one showcasing Alonso Cano 1601â€“67 and JosÃ© de Ribera 1591â€“1652.
In the others a couple of minor portraits by VelÃ¡zquez hang alongside the occasional Rubens Tintoretto and Bellini which have somehow been smuggled in.
Rooms 17 to 22 offer a space full of Bravo Murillo and last but most captivating 13 pieces by Goya including self-portraits portraits of King Fernando VII and the infamous minister Manuel Godoy along with one on bullfighting.
The 19th and 20th centuries are the themes upstairs.
Itâ€™s not the most extensive or engaging modern collection but youâ€™ll find drawings by Picasso as well as works by JoaquÃ­n Sorolla Juan Gris Eduardo Chillida and Ignacio Zuloaga in most cases with only one or two items each.
