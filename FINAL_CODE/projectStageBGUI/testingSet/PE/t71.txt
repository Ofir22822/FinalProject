The current version was designed by Francesco Sabatini who also designed the Puerta de AlcalÃ¡ and finished off the Palacio Real.
He designed the church with an unusual floor plan the nave is circular and surrounded by chapels guarded by imposing marble statues of the 12 apostles 12 prophets rendered in wood sit above them at the base of the dome.
Each of the chapels is adorned with frescoes and decorated according to a different historical style but most people rush to the neo-plateresque Capilla de San Bernardino where the central fresco was painted by Goya in the early stages of his career.
Unusually Goya has painted himself into the scene heâ€™s the one in the yellow shirt on the right.
A series of corridors behind the high altar accessible only as part of the guided visit is lined with works of art from the 17th to 19th centuries highlights include a painting by Francisco ZurbarÃ¡n and another by Francisco Pacheco the father-in-law and teacher of VelÃ¡zquez.
In the sacristy watch out for the fine Renaissance sillerÃ­a the sculpted walnut seats where the churchâ€™s superiors would meet.
A word about the opening hours although entry is free during morning Mass times there is no access to the museum and the lights in the Capilla de San Bernardino wonâ€™t be on to illuminate the Goya.
At all other times visit is by Spanish-language guided tour included in the admission price.
Just to confuse matters you may face a similar problem if youâ€™re here on a Friday afternoon or any time Saturday if thereâ€™s a wedding taking place.
