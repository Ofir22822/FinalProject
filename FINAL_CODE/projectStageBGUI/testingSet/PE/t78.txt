The history of the cathedral goes back to the 15th century but the history of Christian worship on the site dates to the mid-13th century.
In 1248 the Castilian king Fernando III captured Seville from its Almohad rulers and transformed their great 12th-century mosque into a church.
Some 153 years later in 1401 the cityâ€™s ecclesiastical authorities decided to replace the former mosque which had been damaged by an earthquake in 1356 with a spectacular new cathedral Lets construct a church so large future generations will think we were mad they quipped or so legend has it.
The result is the staggering cathedral you see today officially known as the Catedral de Santa MarÃ­a de la Sede.
Itâ€™s one of the worldâ€™s largest churches and a veritable treasure trove of art with notable works by ZurbarÃ¡n Murillo Goya and others.
Exterior With its immense flying buttresses and Gothic embellishments the cathedrals exterior provides a suitably dramatic shell for the treasures within.
Pause to look at the Puerta del PerdÃ³n now the cathedrals exit on Calle Alemanes which is one of the few remaining elements of the original mosque.
Sala del PabellÃ³n Selected treasures from the cathedralâ€™s art collection are exhibited in this room the first after the ticket office.
Much of whatâ€™s displayed here as elsewhere in the cathedral is the work of masters from Sevilleâ€™s 17th-century Golden Age.
Tomb of Christopher Columbus Once inside the cathedral proper head right until you come to the tomb of Christopher Columbus the Sepulcro de CristÃ³bal ColÃ³n in front of the Puerta del PrÃ­ncipe Door of the Prince.
The monument supposedly contains the remains of the great explorer but debate continues as to whether the bones are actually his.
Columbusâ€™ remains were moved many times after his death in 1506 in Valladolid northern Spain and there are those who claim his real bones lie in Santo Domingo.
Certainly his bones spent time in the Dominican Republic after they were shipped to Spanish-controlled Hispaniola from their original resting place the Monasterio de la Cartuja in 1537.
However they were later sent to Havana and returned to Seville in 1898.
DNA testing in 2006 proved a match between the bones supposed to be Columbus and bones known to be from his brother Diego.
And while that didnâ€™t conclusively solve the mystery it strongly suggested that the great man really is interred in the tomb that bears his name.
SacristÃ­a de los CÃ¡lices To the right of Columbus tomb are a series of rooms containing some of the cathedralâ€™s greatest masterpieces.
First up is the Sacristy of the Chalices behind the Capilla de los Dolores where Francisco de Goyaâ€™s painting of the Sevillan martyrs Santas Justa y Rufina 1817 hangs above the altar.
SacristÃ­a Mayor Next along is this large room with a finely carved stone cupola created between 1528 and 1547.
Pedro de CampaÃ±aâ€™s 1547 El descendimiento Descent from the Cross above the central altar at the southern end and Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡nâ€™s Santa Teresa to its right are two of the cathedralâ€™s most precious paintings.
Also look out for the Custodia de Juan de Arfe a huge 475kg silver monstrance made in the 1580s by Renaissance metal smith Juan de Arfe.
Sala Capitular The circular chapter house also called the Cabildo features a stunning carved dome and a Murillo masterpiece La inmaculada set high above the archbishopâ€™s throne.
The room whose design was inspired by Michelangelos Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome was built between 1558 and 1592 as a venue for meetings of the cathedral hierarchy.
Also impressive is the Antecabildo with its decorated vaulted ceiling.
Capilla Mayor Even in a church as spectacular as this the Capilla Mayor Main Chapel stands out with its astonishing Gothic retable reckoned to be the worlds largest altarpiece.
Begun by Flemish sculptor Pieter Dancart in 1482 and finished by others in 1564 this sea of gilt and polychromed wood holds more than 1000 carved biblical figures.
At the centre of the lowest level is a tiny 13th-century silver-plated cedar image of the Virgen de la sede Virgin of the See patron of the cathedral.
Coro West of the Capilla Mayor and dominating the central nave is the 16th-century Coro Choir.
This giant box-like structure incorporates 114 elaborately wooden seats in Gothic-MudÃ©jar style and a vast organ.
Capilla de San Antonio The chapels along the sides of the cathedral hold yet more artistic treasures.
Of particular note is the Capilla de San Antonio at the western end of the northern aisle housing Murilloâ€™s gigantic 1656 depiction of the VisiÃ³n de San Antonio de Padua Vision of St Anthony of Padua.
The painting was victim of a daring art heist in 1874.
Giralda In the northeastern corner of the cathedral youâ€™ll find the entry to the Giralda.
The climb to the top involves walking up 35 ramps built so that the guards could ride up on horseback and a small flight of stairs at the top.
Your reward is sensational rooftop views.
The decorative brick tower which tops out at 104m was the minaret of the mosque constructed between 1184 and 1198 at the height of Almohad power.
Its proportions delicate brick-pattern decoration and colour which changes with the light make it perhaps Spainâ€™s most perfect Islamic building.
The topmost parts â€“ from bell level up â€“ were added in the 16th century when Spanish Christians were busy â€˜improving onâ€™ surviving Islamic buildings.
At the very top is El Giraldillo a 16th-century bronze weather vane representing â€˜faith that has become a symbol of Seville.
Patio de los Naranjos Outside the cathedralâ€™s northern flank this patio was originally the mosques main courtyard.
Itâ€™s planted with 66 naranjos orange trees and has a small Visigothic fountain in the centre.
Look out for a stuffed crocodile hanging over the courtyards doorway â€“ its a replica of a gift the Sultan of Egypt gave Alfonso X in around 1260.
