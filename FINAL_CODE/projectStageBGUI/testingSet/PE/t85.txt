The Houses of Parliament are officially called the Palace of Westminster and its oldest part is 11th-century Westminster Hall one of only a few sections that survived a catastrophic 1834 fire.
The rest is mostly a neo-Gothic confection built over 36 years from 1840.
The palaces most famous feature is its clock tower Elizabeth Tower better known as Big Ben covered in scaffolding until restoration works are finished in 2021.
