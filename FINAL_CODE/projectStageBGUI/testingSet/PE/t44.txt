Itâ€™s a surreal enchanting place where the great Modernistas passion for natural forms really took flight and the artificial almost seems more natural than the natural.
The park is extremely popular and access to the central area is limited to 400 people every half-hour â€“ book ahead online.
The rest of the park is free and can be visited without booking.

The project was a commercial flop and was abandoned in 1914 â€“ but not before GaudÃ­ had created 3km of roads and walks steps a plaza and two gatehouses in his inimitable manner.
The idea was based on the English garden cities much admired by GÃ¼ell hence the spelling of Park.
In 1922 the city bought the estate for use as a public park.
Much of the park is still wooded but itâ€™s laced with pathways.
The best views are from the cross-topped TurÃ³ de les Tres Creus TurÃ³ del Calvari in the southwest corner.
Arriving via the parks main eastern entrance youll reach a broad open space the PlaÃ§a de la Natura whose centrepiece is the Banc de TrencadÃ­s completed in 1914.
Curving sinuously around the perimeter this multicoloured tiled bench was designed by one of GaudÃ­â€™s closest colleagues architect Josep Maria Jujol 1879â€“1949.
To the west of the square extends the PÃ²rtic de la Bugadera the Laundry Room Portico a gallery where the twisted stonework columns and roof give the effect of a cloister beneath tree roots â€“ a motif repeated in several places in the park.
With GaudÃ­ however there is always more than meets the eye.
The giant PlaÃ§a de la Natura was designed as a kind of catchment area for rainwater washing down the hillside.
The water is filtered through a layer of stone and sand and drains down through the columns below to an underground cistern.
Beneath the square steps guarded by a much-photographed mosaic dragon/lizard lead to the Sala HipÃ³stila the Doric Temple.
This forest of 86 stone columns â€“ some leaning like mighty trees bent by the weight of time â€“ was originally intended as a market with its tiled ceilings and Catalan vaults.
On the east side of the Sala HipÃ³stila are the lavender-scented Jardins dÃ€ustria.
Just inside the parks southern Carrer dâ€™Olot entrance which sits below the Sala HipÃ³stila and is immediately recognisable by the two Hansel-and-Gretel gatehouses stands the Casa del Guarda.
This typically curvaceous former porterâ€™s home hosts a display on GaudÃ­â€™s building methods and the history of the park.
There are superb views from the top floor and often long queues to get in.
The spired rosy-pink house over by the eastern entrance is the Casa-Museu GaudÃ­ where GaudÃ­ lived for most of his last 20 years 1906â€“26.
It contains furniture designed by him including items that were once at home in La Pedrera Casa BatllÃ³ Casa Calvet and Colonia GÃ¼ell and other memorabilia.
The house was built in 1904 by Francesc Berenguer i Mestres as a prototype for the 60 or so houses that were originally planned here.
One-hour guided tours in multiple languages take place year-round and cost â‚¬12 plus park admission pre-book online.
Private guided tours cost â‚¬45 per person plus admission minimum two people.
The Bus GÃ¼ell shuttle 15 minutes included in pre-bought tickets was introduced in 2019 zipping visitors from Alfons X metro stop lÃ­nia 4 to the parks eastern entrance on Carretera del Carmel.
Arriving by this route youll enter the restricted area from the top at the PlaÃ§a de la Natura.
Alternatively its a 20-minute walk from Lesseps or Vallcarca metro stops the uphill trek is eased by escalators.
Buses H6 and D40 stop on Travessera de Dalt 10 minutes walk south of the park via Avinguda del Santuari de Sant Josep de la Muntaya with escalators.
Bus V19 stops at the eastern entrance.
