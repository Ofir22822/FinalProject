You could easily spend the entire morning inching your way down the hill and the maze of streets.
Cheap clothes luggage old flamenco records even older photos of Madrid faux-designer purses grungy T-shirts household goods and electronics are the main fare.
For every 10 pieces of junk thereâ€™s a real gem a lost masterpiece an Underwood typewriter waiting to be found.
Tickets & tours Sungay Sunshine Rastro Tour Â£95.35 and up Details Madrid Rastro Market Tour & Tapas Crawl Â£51.61 and up Details Scenic Route around El Hierro Â£39.37 and up Details More tickets & tours Details Calle de la Ribera de los Curtidores Hours8am-3pm Sun The crowded Sunday flea market was back in the 17th and 18th centuries largely a meat market rastro means â€˜stainâ€™ in reference to the trail of blood left behind by animals dragged down the hill.
The road leading through the market Calle de la Ribera de los Curtidores translates as Tannersâ€™ Alley and further evokes this sense of a slaughterhouse past.
On Sunday mornings its the place to be with all of Madrid here in search of a bargain.
Antiques are also a major drawcard with a concentration of stores at Nuevas GalerÃ­as and GalerÃ­as Piquer most shops open 10am to 2pm and 5pm to 8pm Monday to Saturday and not all open during El Rastro.
A word of warning pickpockets love El Rastro as much as everyone else so keep a tight hold on your belongings and donâ€™t keep valuables in easy-to-reach pockets.
