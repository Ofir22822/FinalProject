The Trolls Tongue is an epic sight but its a tough hike of 23km or 10 hours return from the trailhead at Skjeggedal 13km northeast of Odda.
Tickets & tours Trolltunga Overnight Hike Â£328.22 and up Details More tickets & tours The hike is usually doable from late May to early September depending on snowfall.
The trail is well marked from the car park with distance markers along the route outlining the distance left to the summit â€“ but the ascent is brutal in places covering a total climb of about 1000m so make 100% sure youre in adequate shape and have the proper gear before you decide to tackle it.
En route watch out for the Tyssestrengene waterfall 646m.
If you want to tackle the walk earlier in the season or youd just prefer to hike with a pro Trolltunga Active offers guided hikes.
You definitely wont be alone at the top â€“ Trolltunga is one of Norways most Instagrammed sights â€“ but standing on the rock and staring out into thin air is worth every step to the top.
If you continue on a little beyond Trolltunga you reach another fine vantage point you reach Preikestolen Pulpit Rock a smaller version of the much more famous lookout of the same name overlooking Lysefjord near Stavanger.
In July and August Tide www.tide.no runs an express coach once a day between Tyssedal and the real Preikestolen car park near Stavanger allowing you to summit both of Norways most famous climbs in just a couple of days.
It costs 695kr one way.
