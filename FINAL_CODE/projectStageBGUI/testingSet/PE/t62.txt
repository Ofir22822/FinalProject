The people who call Tohoku home understand the value of a moment and the preciousness of life.

These are just some of the reasons that Tohoku was voted a top region in Lonely Planets Best in Travel 2020.
ChÅ«son-ji in Hiraizumi Â© Amana Images Inc / Getty Images Samurai treasures Originally home to the indigenous Emishi people Tohoku has a long feudal history.
It was settled by various samurai clans between the 7th and 9th centuries much later than in central and southwestern Japan.
Established in 1620 by Ashina Yoshikatsu the lord of the Satake clan the buke-yashiki in Kakunodate is arguably the countrys best-preserved samurai district.
Many of its beautiful traditional buildings now house museums recalling life in feudal times whilst others have open doors and are free for visitors to wander about.
The main street of the district is lined with ancient cherry trees which make for a spectacular sight in hanami cherry-blossom viewing season have your camera at the ready.
The town of Hiraizumi in Iwate prefecture was Tohokus first Unesco World Cultural Heritage listing and is famed for its handsome historic architecture courtesy of the gold-mining Fujiwara clan who ruled here in the 12th century.
Hiraizumis main attraction is the ChÅ«son-ji temple complex which once housed over 300 buildings including 40 separate temples.
The complex was ravaged by fire in 1337 but two of its original buildings survive.
In Fukushima prefecture the sprawling township of Aizu-Wakamatsu was once a feudal capital and its sights including a number of famous sake breweries are dotted around town.

Why not join them? Not far away youâ€™ll find the village of Risshaku-ji Yamadera immortalised by the itinerant Haiku master Matsuo BashÅ? in his classic The Narrow Road to the Deep North.
It is well worth climbing the 1000 stone steps to the top of the temple for stunning views and if you realise along the path that its all about the journey and not the destination youll be one step closer to attaining enlightenment.
On the Shimokita Peninsula almost at the very tip of Japans main island HonshÅ« youll find the hauntingly beautiful Osorezan-bodaiji temple honouring JizÅ? Bosatsu protector of children and a much-loved deity in Japanese mythology.

But the areas best-known attraction is Matsushima a stunning collection of hundreds of wind and sea-battered islands.
Sublime onsen If you consider yourself an onsen aficionado visits to Tohokus more unique and remote mountain hot springs should be considered a high priority.
Whilst it might take a little more effort to get here youll never forget that night you spent soaking your troubles away beneath a carpet of stars or retreating to your antique room refreshed and ready to dine on a sumptuous kaiseki banquet of local cuisine.
