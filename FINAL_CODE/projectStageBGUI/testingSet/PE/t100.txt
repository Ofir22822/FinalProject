Strewn with marble monuments landscaped lawns the occasional elegant building the Palacio de Cristal is especially worth seeking out and abundant greenery itâ€™s quiet and contemplative during the week but comes to life on weekends.
Put simply this is one of our favourite places in Madrid.

The focal point for so much of El Retiroâ€™s life is the artificial estanque lake which is watched over by the massive ornamental structure of the Monument to Alfonso XII on the east side complete with marble lions.
As sunset approaches on a Sunday afternoon in summer the crowd grows bongos sound out across the park and people start to dance.
Row boats can be rented from the lakes northern shore â€“ an iconic Madrid experience.
On the southern end of the lake the odd structure decorated with sphinxes is the Fuente Egipcia legend has it that an enormous fortune buried in the park by Felipe IV in the mid-18th century rests here.
Hidden among the trees south of the lake is the Palacio de Cristal a magnificent metal-and-glass structure that is arguably El Retiroâ€™s most beautiful architectural monument.
It was built in 1887 as a winter garden for exotic flowers and is now used for temporary exhibitions organised by the Centro de Arte Reina SofÃ­a.
Just north of here the 1883 Palacio de VelÃ¡zquez is also used for temporary exhibitions.
At the southern end of the park near La Rosaleda with its more than 4000 roses is a statue of El Ã?ngel CaÃ­do The Fallen Angel.
Strangely it sits 666m above sea levelâ€¦ The Puerta de Dante in the extreme southeastern corner of the park is watched over by a carved mural of Danteâ€™s Inferno.
Occupying much of the southwestern corner of the park is the JardÃ­n de los Planteles one of the least visited sections of El Retiro where quiet pathways lead beneath an overarching canopy of trees.
West of here is the moving Bosque del Recuerdo an understated memorial to the 191 victims of the 11 March 2004 train bombings.
For each victim stands an olive or cypress tree.
To the north just inside the Puerta de Felipe IV stands what is thought to be Madridâ€™s oldest tree a Mexican conifer ahuehuete planted in 1633.
In the northeastern corner of the park is the Ermita de San Isidro a small country chapel noteworthy as one of the few albeit modest examples of Romanesque architecture in Madrid.
When it was built Madrid was a small village more than 2km away.
