It was originally the way recruits said goodbye when they were leaving to join the army to prove that they were prepared for the demanding military service and also to impress the girls.
A peculiarity of Verbu≈àk is that the dancers are not bound by any fixed choreography.
This means that each dancer can choose to interpret it any way he chooses.
It is said that you cannot learn Verbu≈àk but that boys from Moravian Slovakia are born with Verbu≈àk in their blood.
Allow yourself to be carried away in a whirl of colours and rhythms When dancing the Verbu≈àk the dancer is also a singer.
Sung and danced verses alternate and the number of dance moves performed also increases as the dance speeds up.
These include skips jumps knee bends twirls and hand claps.
Verbu≈àk has become an integral part of various festivities.
Men dance it at every opportunity when there is any feasting grape harvest or even regular dances.
Allow yourself to be carried away by the energy of the dancers which you will not experience anywhere else.
