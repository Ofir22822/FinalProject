Nowhere else will you find such a wealth of original buildings dating from the Middle Ages.
You cant help but ask yourself whether time has stood still as you amble past the beautiful old houses secluded squares and tucked-away corners of the old quarter where towers taverns and town gates alternate with fountains fortifications and former storehouses.

in 1631 during the Thirty Years War Rothenburg was captured by General Tilly of the Catholic forces.
In desperation the councillors offered him wine in a tankard that could hold more than three litres.
Tilly who had intended to burn down the town showed clemency and decreed that he would spare Rothenburg if anyone could empty the vessel in one steady chug.
The former mayor came forward and to everyones astonishment met the challenge.
Tilly was suitably impressed and let the town stand.
Whether all of this is true nobody really knows but its undoubtedly a great story â€“ and it also gives rise to the annual Meistertrunk festival a historical spectacle with a focus on entertainment.
