Inspiration Tips Barcelona is well-known for its sun and beaches.
Even in winter when temperatures hover around the mid-40s it’s practically balmy.
With so much sun in this coastal city visitors often get lucky and can hang out on the beach year-round.
Given the weather you may be surprised to discover that Barcelona provides access to some of the best and most affordable skiing in Europe.
Just two hours away from the city are various ski resorts in the Pyrenees of Andorra.
Visiting Andorra Andorra Andorra is a tiny independent principality that’s nestled between the French and Spanish Pyrenees mountains.
If you haven’t heard of it you aren’t alone — it’s the sixth smallest nation in Europe.
Andorra is primarily accessible by bus and car.
Public transport routes are frequent from Barcelona.
Other Catalonian cities including Girona Reus and Lleida also provide easy access to Andorra’s resorts.
Alternatively if you’re visiting from France coaches and shuttle buses leave from Toulouse Carcassonne and Perpignan.
Those renting a car and driving to Andorra should be sure to travel with snow socks or chains as storms can come in quickly often stranding vehicles until the roads are cleared.
If you don’t want to rent a car long-distance car-sharing apps like BlaBlaCar are also popular.
Skiing in Andorra Andorra has three main ski resorts Grandvalira Pal Arinsal and Ordino Arcalís.
Ordino Arcalís and Pal Arinsal which are neighboring resorts in the Valls del Nord region of Andorra both sell their own ski passes.
The Grandvalira ski area is located in eastern Andorra.
As of 2019 each lift pass to Grandvalira also grants free entry to the Ordino Arcalís resort.
Entering Andorra from Spain vs.
France Given Andorra’s location most of its towns provide access to ski resorts.
However keep in mind that the Spanish and French routes enter from different sides of the country.
From the Spanish side you’re likely to come in through Andorra la Vella Andorra’s capital.
The capital provides access to all three of Andorra’s ski resorts.
If you enter from France you’ll usually come in through Pas de la Casa at the eastern end of the Grandvalira resort area.
Staying here and skiing in the Valls del Nord area isn’t possible without a car.
Ordino Arcalís Ordino Arcalis 82 Reviews Ordino Arcalís has one of the longest ski seasons in Europe running from mid-November to the first week of May.
This Andorran resort is known for having some of the best off-piste skiing in Andorra.
It also offers snowshoe excursions ski biking snowmobiling ski mountaineering ski paragliding and heliskiing.
There are even excursions that will take you up the mountain at night to sleep under the stars.
Be aware that Ordino Arcalís is a fairly small ski resort Slope length is just 18 miles with 16 lifts and 28 runs.
But if you are comfortable with off-piste runs this is an especially great place to experience.
Most people who choose to visit this area stay in Andorra la Vella or nearby.
From there you can take a bus to and from the lifts.
Ordino Arcalís’ distance from most towns means that it’s much more relaxed compared to other resorts and has limited après-ski culture.
However you’ll still find six different restaurant-bars on the mountain where you can take in the views and relax.
Most nightlife will be around Andorra la Vella or in the nearby resort of Arinsal.
Pal Arinsal Vallnord Pal-Arinsal 859 Reviews Pal Arinsal is about twice the size of Ordino Arcalís.
It has a ski area of 39 miles with 29 mechanical lifts and 52 ski runs.
Pal Arinsal is known as a family-friendly ski resort that’s best suited to beginner and intermediate skiers.
In addition to skiing it also offers snowshoe excursions snow mountaineering snow triking a ropes course zip lining and panoramic helicopter flights.
Après-ski is much more lively in this part of the Valls del Nord area.
You’ll find various restaurants bars and live music venues to keep you occupied in both the Arinsal and La Massana villages.
Additionally certain restaurants on the runs offer moonlit dinners on weekends.
Although there is a lot going on here keep in mind that this resort is still fairly small.
Don’t expect the extensive après-ski or nightlife that can be found in larger resorts.
Grandvalira Grandvalira 1728 Reviews Grandvalira is consistently heralded as the best resort in Andorra with an expansive ski area of 130 miles.
This ski area has a total of 75 lifts that lead to 139 ski runs as well as a vast array of off-piste opportunities.
It also offers snowmobiling dog sledding snowshoe treks snow tubing zip lining and various snow parks for freestylers.
As the largest of the Andorran resorts the Grandvalira area has a number of places to stay.
The most convenient hotels are in Pas de la Casa Grau Roig Soldeu El Tarter Canillo and Encamp where the main lifts are.
Hotels in these areas will provide you with access to the widest variety of restaurants and après-ski options.
Pas de la Casa is the most happening location providing easy access to a multitude of restaurants bars and clubs.
It even hosts an annual electronic music festival the Hibernation Festival toward the end of the season.
Visitors who prefer a more traditional après-ski experience often favor Soldeu a smaller town with excellent restaurants bars and spas.
Keep in mind that admission to Grandvalira automatically includes access to the Ordino Arcalís area.
However you can’t reach Ordino Arcalís from the towns mentioned above without a car.
If you’re keen on skiing both sectors and getting the most out of your pass you’ll likely prefer to stay near Canillo Encamp or Andorra la Vella.
Season Passes for Ski Aficionados If you’re planning on skiing at least two weeks this winter it may be worth buying a season pass.
Andorra’s season tickets are heavily discounted when they’re released for sale each fall.
Season passes usually provide more options than day entry.
For instance Pal Arinsal and Ordino Arcalís day and week passes are sold as separate tickets.
However if you want to ski both areas regularly it’s possible to purchase a combined season ticket known as the Valls de Nord pass.
The most expensive and expansive resort Grandvalira comes with a variety of benefits including discounted parking a free one-day pass for a friend and discounts on restaurants and spas in the area.
Best of all Grandvalira’s season pass provides free entry to other resorts around the world.
For instance the 2019-2020 season pass includes three-day passes to Skirama Dolomiti Italy Kiroro Japan and Chapelco and Cerro Castor Argentina as well as a five-day pass to Verbier Switzerland.
If those destinations are too far to interest you the Grandvalira ski pass also provides access to other resorts in the Pyrenees.
You’ll receive a day pass for La Masella in the Spanish Pyrenees and unlimited access to the French Pyrenees resorts of Huatacam and Gavarnie Gèdre.
