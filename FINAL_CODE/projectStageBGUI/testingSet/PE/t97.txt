The Select Samples of The Ottoman Civilian Architecture Safranbolu Houses Safranbolu managing to preserve its complete old settlement texture is home to historical houses grouped in two main areas The first is the Bazaar section thats mostly used during winter and previously known as the City while the second one is previously known as Vineyards and was mostly used during summer time.
The locals spent the winter months in the City and they moved to their summerhouses in the Vineyards upon the arrival of warmer summer days however life in marketplace the centre of production and trade used to be lively and hectic through the year.
With thier unique architecture and locations the houses of Safranbolu give the guests insight into the former Turkish lifestyle.
Safranbolu houses were mostly built by the side of the valley for two reasons the first is to avert the occupation of fertile agricultural lands and the second is associated with the good grace and decency of neighbour relations among the Turkish people.
Because the houses were constructed on the slopes they do not hinder one anothers view and exposure to sunlight.
The upper stories supported by buttresses project over the cobbled pavements which were made as inclined to resist flood waters and to minimize humid effect.
Safranbolu adores those who set eyes on its beautiful houses that defy time with their sound stance and reflect an architecture of superior taste in company with fine wooden decoration.
Some houses designed as museums have an eye-catching wooden artwork on ceilings and some possess an indoor pool to cool the air and to avoid fire.
