Our strive to keep you entertained during these times of isolation continues and this time have a mixed bag of games for you. We haven’t picked them at random, however. All of the titles we’ll present to you today have graphics that are far above the average for mobile games and offer eye-pleasing effects on top of that. Of course, these games aren’t just eye candy, they also offer immersive environments and engaging gameplay. Excited to see what’s coming next? Let’s get right to it, then! TauCeti Technology Benchmark Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Yes, we know what you're thinking: "Is that even a game?" And technically, it is. Sure, not a long one, but there is some gameplay involved. Mostly, it's meant to highlight what visuals can be achieved on smartphones today but since we're talking about high-graphics games, we decided to throw it in the mix. This is a first-person shooter and the graphics and effects are truly impressive. It won't keep you busy for long, but if you want to see how your phone will handle heavy 3D games, TauCeti is definitely a good choice to make your device sweat. As the name suggests, there are also a couple of benchmarks you can run as well. Call of Duty: Mobile Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Do we even need to describe Call of Duty? It’s the most popular first-person franchise in the world and as soon as the game was released for mobile devices, it was a success. The realistic graphics are a big part of it, but credit must be given to the game’s features as well. Multiple game modes to choose from, each with a unique twist on the familiar gameplay. From weapons and loadouts you can customize to unlocking achievements, there’s plenty to like about Call of Duty: Mobile. If you haven’t joined the millions of players already, now’s the best time to do so! Asphalt 9: Legends Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Asphalt 9 is another super-popular game and with good reason. The graphics are so good you start wondering how smartphones can be so powerful these days. Sure, the actual driving is far from realistic, your car spends more time flipping through the air than actually using its tires and the steering is pretty much automatic, but it’s all in the name of entertainment. And this game delivers on that front as well. Exoctic hyper cars, detailed maps, challenging opponents, it has it all. Endless Nightmare Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store If you're the type of person that likes to be scared and enjoys watching horror movies, Endless Nightmare is here to provide some creepiness to your day. You have to explore your own home to find out the truth about the horrible event that transpired in it. The game's graphics will help you immerse yourself in the spooky environment and hopefully contribute towards better scares throughout your adventure. That's what it's all about, right? The Gardens Between Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Puzzle games aren't usually known for their amazing graphics but The Gardens Between is an exception. The level design of this game is exceptional and just a joy to look at. The puzzles themselves are quite clever as well, so you'll enjoy the challenge while also enjoying the visuals. It should be noted that the game costs $4.99 on both Android and iOS, but at least that way you know your gameplay won't be interrupted by ads every two minutes and you can focus on solving the puzzles. Mindcell Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Mindcell is a not a very popular game but it deserves to be on this list. In this futuristic third-person shooter, you have to fight your way to your freedom, otherwise you'll become an experimental test subject and that's something that doesn't promise a good outcome. The levels you'll go through are diverse and detailed, pretty close to those of a console title. You'll encounter a wide range of enemies and bosses while looking for your escape, so be prepared for some high-paced action. The game costs $1 on iOS and $5 on Android, which might stop someone from trying it out, but if you're eager to experience something new, go for it! ARK: Survival Evolved Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store ARK is a game with an amazing open world where dinosaurs roam free and you begin your journey scraping for food and clothes, trying your best to stay alive. As you become more experienced, however, you’ll find yourself the master of these same dinosaurs and owner of a base you’ve designed and built yourself. You don’t have to do everything alone, however, you can always find likeminded people and join a tribe. Together, you can go on adventures in the beautifully crafted environment, where plenty of secrets are waiting to be discovered. The First Tree Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store The First Tree is a very unique game. It's all about relaxation and enjoyment. There are no enemies to fight, no ways to die and nothing that can scare or upset you. It's basically a fairy tale you get to participate in. As a fox. But you can also look at it as a form of interactive meditation, as the levels are so calming and pleasing to look at, you'll feel the stress of the day draining away from you as you play. It's a paid game, costing $5 on both platforms, but if you're appreciative of games as a form of art, The First Tree will be a valuable addition to your collection. Iron Blade: Medieval Legends RPG Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Iron Blade is a classic RPG. Your character is covered in armor head to toe and is swinging around the biggest and baddest weapons he can get his hands on, leaving countless monsters dead in the process. And while many games of that type exist for smartphones, few of them look as good as Iron Blade. The levels are vast and the change between different environments keeps the gameplay from feeling boring. As you level up, you’ll learn new skills and gain access to more powerful weapons, which you’ll need to defeat the bosses. The game also has a PvP element where you’re in charge of your own castle and have to defend it from the invasion forces of other players. It’s not all hacking and slashing in Iron Blade! Black Desert Mobile Download from Google Play Store Download from Apple App Store Last but not least, we have an MMORPG for you. Black Desert has amzing graphics with a huge emphasis on spectacular skill effects which makes battles look epic even if there’s only a handful of enemies involved. You can choose between five classes, each with a unique fighting style and skillset. You’ll have to work hard to gain the experience needed to unlock the most powerful skills and acquire quality gear since you start with almost nothing. With plenty of other players roaming around the world, you can make new friends or just partner up to complete a quest or two faster. Black Desert suffers from some of the negatives of free games, but overall, it offers plenty fo enjoy as well. It’s definitely worth a try!
