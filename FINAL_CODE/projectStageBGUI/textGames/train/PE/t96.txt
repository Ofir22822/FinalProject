Its Amazing
epicccccccccccc
Other FIFAs were better
FIFA 19 IS A LIT GAME
AWESOME!!!!!!!!
Banned me from the transfer market?!
Good game. Lots of in-game purchases though.
Awful
One of the worst games out on the market bad game
I think this game is easy once you get the hang of it like accurate passing\shooting
FIFA is getting worse and worse every year. The developers are constantly making content mistakes. The only reasons I think it is 11+ 1. Consumerism - Many users are Pay To Win and your child may be encouraged to buy FIFA Points for real money to open packs. 2. Maturity - FIFA's gameplay is not the best, so if your child is not mature enough to handle a loss whether it was fair or unfair, then I wouldn't recommend this game. I hope FIFA 20 is better.
Listen yeah so i was playing with ac milan and i thought that i was going to lose but then obviously cos the creator of fifa is a real g still i won cos i'm lit at fifa still and man won the game like 10-4 against some next up team like liverpool or someting. But still, mandem should check out the game unless you are an o t bot.
FIFA19 is the best game ever
They banned me from the transfer market for no apparent reason whatsoever. Every year FIFA come up with these new ideas of adding new modes to their game like the journey, fut draft, fut champions. But they possibly have the worst servers in video game history! All they care about is money. If you don't win many games then to win you have to pay them money to buy fifa points and coins. The fact that the amount of fifa points is nothing compared to the amount of cash that just left your wallet! Some of my friends even told me that they spent more money on in-game purchases than for the actual game. And the game is £50! Don't end up wasting your money on such a trash game that doesn't improve every year. And be warned not to buy FIFA 20 as well. The FUT champions mode is so time consuming. You have to play so many games just to qualify and you have to win them! You can't win without having any "pack luck" or using real money to win. It's just pay to win basically. Once you get in you either have the laggiest servers where they quit you when your winning or the biggest tryhards in the planets. They have every player over 85 and none of my players are over 75.
Great game. No inapropraite content. You can end up spending a lot on the game though purchases is a big factor in the game. It is quite inspiring a shows that with motivation you can do anything in life.
Your house will be smashed up by a kid as it is THAT frustrating.
Don’t buy this game
Great Game (mild violence)
I've been playing this game for a while now, and I think it's really great! There's some mild violence, but not too much. This is a great strategy game, and will require the player to think about their moves! The graphics, and the controls are great aswell! Language is good for 8/9 and up.
The best online tcg you can find
12 plus?????
MTG Review by Bolas Fan
Seems like a lot of whine posts
I’ve been playing tabletop Magic the Gathering for many years, and this is the first online version which I actually liked. The gameplay is exactly the same as the original Magic the Gathering, and they have a intro for new players. New cards are added every time Wizard of the Coasts adds a new set (which is about every 3 months). There are some in-app purchase, but it is expected. Overall it’s a great game, especially if you are not able to play Magic the Gathering with your friends (for whatever reasons).
As a long time player of magic the gathering I think this is a good way to play Magic when there is no one else around to play with, and the microtransactions are easily avoidable
It seems violent in the pictures, but it does not show the actual creatures or planeswalkers attacking each other, it just shows the cards attacking. Also, the role models and messages are the planeswalkers who seem nice, such as Ajani, Vivien, Jace, etc. Great game, no debate the best trading card game.
MTG arena is a fun game and makes a complicated game like magic simpler for beginners. It is free which fixes many of the problems surrounding the somewhat static player base of mtg. I’ve been playing modern in paper for for 9 years and I will point out to many of the adult whine reviewers. Just because you lose doesn’t mean the game isn’t fair. There are many online databases of what the best decks are, use that. If you don’t want to play with other people’s decks then I’m sorry to say magic the gathering may not be for you unless you are able to lose.
Great Message for teens
Okay Game, Not Nearly As Good As The First Two
2 bros in the woods running from the cops
A good game!
Has violence and racism, and little gore. Mention of sex, drugs and alcohol as well.
Deep story telling but very mature
doesn’t deserve 18+
Best life is strange in the series
PLEASE GET THIS GAME, I'M BEGGING YOU
Best game
As the game is rated M it isn't the worst game and it really does tackle some hard topics like racism and what not which I can agree is a problem with society now. the game does have uses of [email protected]#$, S#@%,etc its nothing crazy no racial slurs or anything like that it does tackle many political things and because the main character is Mexican he is one that kind of gets treated like crap which I can agree is a problem now either with it being in schools or in public. as the game shows that life can be crap sometimes it also goes to show a lot of the good things in life as well. The main character is a 16 year old boy and his little brother as I don't want to spoil anything but the relationship you get with your brother in game has a very positive message like no matter how annoying your little brother or life may be you just have to look on the bright side and be in a good relationship with younger or older siblings. I guess it really depends on how mature your child is because it has a serious topic with some jokes here and there it is a choice game which means if your child isn't very mature maybe he will steal or choose alternative methods but other than that its something that I believe every child at the age of 13 should start seeing some kids get depressed and as this shows sadness at some points it also shows the good in life as well and it made me feel something because I have been having a hard time lately but I because of this game I appreciate my life and the people around me more than I ever really have and I hope it also brings something out on your kids as well. Have a great Night/Day and I hope this has helped you decide to get it or not.
I was honestly dissapointed when I played this. The first two games are WAY better. This game was boring in comparison. I miss the Arcadia Bay characters, and although I wished we would get a Life Is Strange 2 with them, I was still ready to welcome new, exciting characters. The game itself is boring to me, and lacks the humor and charm that the original games did. It does show the strength of a brothers bond, and the importance of family. Sean can be either a good or bad role model for Daniel, depending on your choices. In the second episode there is a disturbing scene involving the dog, Mushroom, and in the later episodes, you see a bare chested woman and if you go skinny dipping,naked butts. There is also an underage optional sex scene, which shows them getting in the tent together, and then it fades to black, then showing them afterwards. There is swearing in it, racism shown against Esteban, Sean and Daniel because of their mexican heritage, alcohol and marijuana use, and violence. I'd say this game is a little bit more mature than the originals, but the originals were by far better. I do not reccomend this game to play.
This game is amazing, 2 bros from seattle trying to walk all the way to mexico, because the younger brother has a telekinesis power and accidentally killed 3 cops, his dad, and his idiotic neighbor. I feel this game has a great messege with crime, brotherhood, and life in the U.S.
This is a very decent title! I have not played the former titles in Life is Strange, but I can say this about this one; It's really good and I think anyone could play this. There are minimal brutal scenes, just a couple. I would not let anyone under 12 play this game. It will enhance the experience the more mature you are. I really enjoyed it. There are no racist and/or "awful" political messages. The people saying that are overreacting and it's no more or less "extreme" content and characters you see in a normal movie. There are some swearwords, there is a blurred out cover of a dirty magazine and some violence, but that's all! I really recommend!
Story based game with lots of bad language and suited for teenagers and up. Also has talk of drugs and alcohol, as well as sexual content. Has scenes involving a police officer being racist towards a Mexican family, and the protagonist talks about drugs being used at a party, as well as sex.
I have been playing through all the life is strange games recently and I love all of them. But this one is by far the most mature. Language is present through out every episode including c**k, c**t, f**k, s**t and so forth and some of it is said by an 11 year old boy. But probably the biggest thing is the drug use. This is most apparent in episode 3. In episode three Sean and Daniel work on a weed farm and other characters use substances and smoke through bongs. Alcohol is also very apparent and characters get drunk and high. On top of that there is one scene in the beginning of episode 3 with a topless woman. Apparently there was a way to create a sexual encounter in episode three but I didn’t do it do to my choices but it’s still present. Violence isn’t huge but it’s present. Most notable being the beginning with the cops and the end of episode 3 and 4. In episode 3 Daniel freaks out over a characters death who is shot with a shotgun( dead body shown with wounds) and destroys the place and Sean loses his eye in the process. This is pretty graphic and shows Sean’s face covered in blood and his missing eye. At the end of episode 4 Sean is beat repetitively by a cult member and almost shot. While this isn’t awful you have the choice to kill the cult leader and it can be pretty frightening and the encounter in the church is very intense. But while this game definitely has its mature content it also delivers a very emotional narrative about brotherhood. Sean is willing to go through anything to protect Daniel and that is shown many times throughout the game. Their relationship felt very real and deep and I felt like I was Daniels brother trying to protect him. All and all this game is excellent and if your child wants to play it I would suggest playing it with them. Don’t let what I just said turn you off because if they’re in high school trust me they’ve heard plenty of language and drug references. So I would suggest this for ages 17 and up or a mature 15 year old.
This is the BEST game I have ever played. Life is strange 2 is a decision game so you can choose what you do and don’t do, there are some unavoidable mild drug scenes and a little bit of violence but because it’s mostly off camera it’s not explicit. It has great family messages and it’s REALLY easy to play. In the games there a 1 or 2 intense scenes but that’s about it, it’s rated R because of interactive drug use but that’s all avoidable thanks to the decision making feature. Even the sex scene is avoidable. Parents this should NOT be rated R (18+). (The bad part is the swearing)
This game has amazing story, where you play as an older brother who has a little brother with telekinesis. You can either be a jerk to your brother or a older brother who learned that his little bro isn’t that bad. Lots of heartfelt moments and it’s so cool to ask your little brother to lift things with his mind. And the brother can hesitate to listen some times, it makes it feel so real when you listen to him saying no to you instead of being really AI like. Best game in the series . There is some F bombs and other swear words but if your mature enough it’s pretty alright.
This is honestly one of the most astounding, beautiful, hard-hitting, breathtaking, pure games I've ever played. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT my favourite game of all time. I just finished up crying from the ending because of how amazing and wonderful it was. The music, the graphics, the characters, the story, it's just so beautiful. I'm completely speechless, this game is amazing in every single way. It's such a great interactive experience that touches you in every single way. It deals with heavy topics like racism, sexism, drugs and homophobia. If this review hasn't persuaded you to buy the game yet, I don't know what will. Children guide - There is a bit of sex in LIS2. The worst of it is probably the full view of a woman's breasts for a few seconds. There are also choices that a player can make to have sex and go skinny dipping. (Most of this is in episode 3, so beware!) There is a lot of swearing throughout the whole game. If a child is mature enough and can handle swearing sensibly, then this might not matter, but it is quite common. There is quite a bit of violence, but again, if a child is mature enough this wouldn't really matter. There aren't too many drugs. Many characters smoke various drugs throughout the game, but it isn't really shown to be a bad thing, so if your child knows that drugs are bad and can handle them, they're fine to play. In episode three, there is really heavy themes of drugs, so again, be warned.
Super appropriate
