The Highest Quality
Even my mom approved
Not violent
My parents were skeptical about getting me this game at first. I eventually convinced them and got the game soon afterwards. I turned on the Graphic Filters so there was no Blood or Gore. The first time I played this game I was quite surprised at how wrong the rating was. I own other teen games like Destiny 2 and COD Black ops 4 is hardly any worse (w/graphic filters). I highly recommend this game to anyone 13 or older.
My mom never lets me get graphic shooters and when I kept begging she said she didn’t want me under that influence. However, after figuring out you can turn off blood and gore she allowed me to get it and it’s my first shooter ever. If my mom approves anyone should.
Hi, i'm a teen and I think is game is ok. This is because Black Ops 4 has a setting to turn off blood and gore. It makes the game wayyy more enjoyable for kids. THANKS!
Good game
This is a great kids game.
I love Luigi!
The gameplay can be very challenging and confusing at times. It’s best if you start playing it around 9-10.
I've seen Nintendo make some great games over the years. From Super Mario Brothers to Warioware, there has been a great selection of games. However, one has stood out among the rest. That game is Luigi's Mansion. As far as character morels go, it's pretty solid on the importance of family. I mean, Luigi, who is easily frightened by anything, is risking his life to save his brother from a haunted mansion. He truly cares for his brother and would risk everything to help him. The "violence" in this game is super mild, even by Mario's standards. The ghosts play the equivalent of small pranks on Luigi's for the majority of the game. As for consumerism, there is a small amount, but remember, this is Nintendo we are talking about. Luigi's Mansion is technically part of the Mario Brother's franchise. However, overall, this game is great and I would recommend buying it as a gift for kids.
For all of you people who think this game involves demons, don't worry. It doesn't contain any malicious content at all. The violence is nonexistent or kept at a minimum. I will note that when a ghost does enter the room, it will release a laugh that, when you aren't paying any attention to the game or if you are very jumpy, such as I am, the noise will surprise you. Otherwise, totally kid friendly.
I love wwe games this has good graphics and gameplay I could play it for hours and not get bored
MYCAREER IS THE BEST!!!
Pretty amazing
Great
It's fine for kids
Awesome game
2k have finally brought back the fun and thrills of previous games like 2k14
If you get this game you may become hooked to it because of the great gameplay
Ok so WWE 2k19 has the BEST MYCAREER mode in any game.So you start as a wrestler on the indies then make your way up to Main Eventing Wrestlemania!!!I won't give any more spoilers but let me just say that this time you are involved in the process instead of just playing matches and doing a promo every now and then.I wish it could be longer but this this Mycareer is the start of the new way of doing Mycareer!!!Besides that though there is 2k Towers where you face multiple opponets to win,Including a huge 2k tower with Styles vs many more opponets in the million dollar challenge.The gameplay is about the same.
Wwe2k19 is very fun. It has a lot of characters but leaves a lot out. It Is violent because your punching, kicking, slamming, and use of chairs,sledgehammers ect. but nothing on the level of games like hitman and assassins creed. There is some swearing and blood but blood can be turned off. Over all it's perfectly fine for kids.
This year WWE 2K19 was excellent. The MyCareer storyline was nice, I like the new editions to universe (like choosing a winner when simulating) and the graphics are awesome! I also really enjoy doing the 2K towers but I still haven't completed The AJ Styles Million Dollar Tower. Also try the Daniel Bryan Showcase edition.
This game is fine for kids to play. There is some splatters of red pixels that are classed as "blood" but it really isn't that harmful for kids. Some may say that the women are showing "a bit too much" but I argue that the men are wearing the same type of clothes as the women. Honestly, the game is fun, enjoyable and pretty easy to play. There are also other cool modes like a career path, big heads and backstage brawls. I'd say that this is the perfect gift for kids over 8.
This is an awesome game especially with your friends and not too violent, you can turn the blood off in setting if that is what you are worried about other then that you should be good with the violence
Very good game, with a massive roster full of stars from then, now and forever with a Daniel Bryan showcase where u recreate his best matches, there is also a career mode where u create your own superstar and go through from high school gyms to Wrestlemania. So the violence - the base of this game is violence however it’s not strong and is more wrestling violence with some punches - not serious. What Common Sense Media didn’t tell you is that with the blood, in settings you can turn it off. The stronger violence is in the extreme rules match types where you can hit your opponent with weapons like kendo sticks, baseball bats, chairs and more but it still isn’t that bad and it doesn’t zoom in and show the hit, and it doesn’t look very realistic anyway. There is barely any language, just in mycareer. Nothing to worry anyone 12 and over. Great game.
nice game
this game is not the best but it’s pretty damn fun. you can play online, make friends in the lobby, and do missions with them. there’s also those quick matches but i don’t play those so i have nothing to say about those. you can also play offline but obviously only do the missions solo. i just hate how easy it is to complete the game because like once you complete the missions and train under every master (my first was sasuke, yuck lmfao) the only thing to do is play the matches (all that online stuff) and/or keep redoing the missions. and it’s even more boring if you’re a loner like me and you have no choice but to do the missions by yourself. ALSO i always have my voice chat on and i don’t think anybody uses it (unless someone invites you to an xbox party i guess) so that sucks :(
The PEGI Rating is overrated
sexy/swearing
Ac Odyssey 13+
mature 8 year olds or just 11 yos
It depends on your child
Assassin's Creed Odyssey review
Still Assassin's Creed, makes you feel like a Spartan
Best AC game yet
I'd say 13+
It's ok for 14 and up
Amazing game, but not for everyone.
Gore
AC Odyssey is a perfect game to learn something and have fun along the way!
It's Good.
OK
Perfect
Malaka
Another Protective Common Sense Mishap
Of course the game has a bit of profanity but the sensuality is not even seen and of few of the statues are nude but it's not like they don't see that kind of stuff in a history Classroom. And of course there is blood but you can turn it off in the setting there for making it a 12+. And a little bonus is a bit of a history lesson.
There are a lot of violent scenes in the duration of the game that are pretty gory. Example: the first cutscene shows a Greek soldier getting stabbed through the mouth with a spear. Though you can turn off the blood for in game violence, you cannot skip these gory cutscenes. There is also plenty of cussing through the game.
For this game I don't think kids under 12 or 11 should play it because it has a lot of swearing in it and sometimes there are options where you can go behind the scenes and have s*x but its behind the scenes so you don't actually see the thing happening. Plus the game doesn't actually tell us what "Malaka" means I would say it means Oh my god or F**k or something I don't know but if you think you know reply to my comment. Also it has some very bloody violence but I don't think its to much blood. But otherwise its fun to explore in it and enjoy the missions the graphics and of course the view and the story. But I strictly do not!... Recommend you to play this game if you do not like sexy stuff or at least don't click on the options!
I have played both the main story and the DLC In this game you will see a lot of cutscenes, (those are there to get better experience for the player) Some cutscenes will show people getting their throat cut and getting a spear through the mouth. This will look really bad with blood on but you can always take the option to have blood off mode. There is “sex” in this game but it’s not necessary, you can always skip it The main characters are good role models and this game really show how the world was 2000+ years ago. There is a lot of history is this game and the most of it is based on real historical events and various religonal beliefs. There is strong language in this game (only in the cutscenes) The characters say words such as “f**k, s**t “ they also say a Greek term “Malaka” which I don’t really know what it means This game is also based on what choices you make so you will very often be able to choose if you want to kill the person or not.
its a hard game NO SEX SCENES AT ALL Alot of swearing its not better than origins but what is
Swearing: If you have already played gta or watch dogs they should be ok with the swearing. It uses f*** and s*** a lot but not as bad as gta. Sex: They is talking about it but u don’t see it and the statutes have private parts but you can see it in a class room Blood: It’s a assassin creed game so of course it is bloody but u can turn of blood but u can’t turn of blood for cutscenes. Overall if you play gta or watch dogs 2 already you should be fine.
I love this game sure it can get pretty violent at times and if you enjoy the original assassin's Creed and hiding in bushes stabbing people in the butt then you'll love this game the blood can be turned off and I think it's educational the swearing is minimum but there is a scene where it shows naked Zeus.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is another sequel set in the beautiful open world of Ancient Greek. Filled with tons of stuff to do, such as main quests, side quests, and doing whatever you like in the sandbox world. Sexuality is minor. Artwork is seen with present genitals. Characters can flirt sometimes resulting in implied sex. Gambling and consumerism is present but not required. You are able to purchase DLC'S. Violence is frequent and depends on how the player plays the game. Some parts of the game are fully scripted gameplay, most parts allow the player more freedom to take on objectives however they'd like, including: stealth, aggressive, neutral, mixed. Use of weapons such as swords, blades, lances, spears, daggers, etc result in blood bursts and characters being left stained with blood. Although you are able to switch off blood in the settings. Language is infrequent but strong. Use of "f#!k", "b#!ch", "bastard", "$h!t" and mild language such as "damn" is heard in dialogue.
Has pretty good role models and messages about killing people to get what you want.
Not recomended for ages below 13. Not only because of violence, swearing and mild sex references, but also because it can sometimes be very hard and challenging. A 10 year old might get frustrated.
It's a gory game with detailed fighting scences and a lot of stabbing, punchure wounds, their is some sexual refrences if theirs a scene where you have gay sex no nudity show its just implied, if you or your child has youtube its no worse or goes to school their is cussing and use of thegreek swear word malaka
First of all, assassins creed odyssey is not the typical assassins creed game that we've all come to love, and hate, over the years. It is basically a rpg(Role playing game) with an assassins creed vibe to it. Role models and positive messages: Does this game include role models or positive messages? No, not really. One of the features added to odyssey that's new in the franchise, is the ability to choose between different responses to questions or actions to take place in the game(These choices have an effect on the game). This means that the protagonist(Alexios or Kassandra) can either turn out better or worse depending on the choices chosen by the player. But all in all the protagonist does kill enemies for revenge. Violence: There is a lot of violence in this game some of it brutal some of it less brutal. During some cutscenes there is very brutal violence, eg. in the first cutscene in the game a spear is thrust through a person's throat, which is actually not that bad in comparison to the first cutscene in assasins creed origins. There is a lot of fighting and, though not as much as in previous assasins creed games, still some stealthy combat. One thing to note is that blood can be turned off in the settings menu. Language: There is frequent swearing, containing words like f*ck, f*cking, sh*t and mal?ka(Greek for "damn it"). Sex: To be honest, the sex in this game is minimal. Some of the dialogue options allow you to make love with npc's, but this is very infrequent and is taken off screen. The only other thing is statues portraying naked people. Would i recommend? Definitely. Some people may find the rpg element in this game boring or overdone, but personally I like the fact that you have to grind for good loot and have different options for skills. Sure, it takes a lot of side quests and exploring to get to a high enough level to be able to do main quests, etc. But I don't think anybody under the age of 13 would be fully able to appreciate the game the way teens and adults would. It's a beautiful game with an enormous amount of time that can be spent playing it.
Gore and blood is very prevenlant and a lot of language but a very good game all around. I say 14~16+
Being a long time fan of assassins creed, I was surprised at how fun and historically accurate, as well as well as educational this game is. Your kid can LEARN A LOT from this game. My favorite part of history is Ancient Greece as well as the Peloponnesian war. I learned SO much from this game about ancient Greece; from Greek gods to historical figures, including Pericles and Herodotus, not to mention all the places you can explore freely. This game is so accurately recreated it is amazing. Anyways, I think that letting your kid or teen play this is a great idea. They can learn a lot and explore ancient Greece in no other way possible. -Blood is able to be turned off -Sex Scenes are referenced when your character closes a door and the screen goes black. -Nudity is on statues; including breasts and penises. -Alcohol is only mentioned with wine making and drunk people appear in the game. (Though not often). -Game has a unique combat system. You need to time attacks and time parrys as well as dodges. -Story. I come to the AC for the story it tells of historical events and makes it educational and interesting. You always want to know more and continue on the main story. -Side quests. Along the way you can help people in need. From a gullible farmer, to city leaders your character helps all sorts of people. Something that promotes a good role model. That was my review of AC Odyssey! Hopefully you found something in this helpful and informative.
If you have had the Talk, heard swearing before, and watched any PG-13 action movie before this game is great.
I Love It. The Violence Is Not Bad But There is Blood. Language Not Heard Frequently. Its Also Kid Freindly Because It Inspires Children To Do Parkour As You Can Zipline And Jump. It Teaches Children To Be Fit And Overcome Their Fears. Get Your Child It If You Want Them To Be Successful. Assasains Creed: Origins, That Game Is The One That Turns Children Into Antisocial Psychopaths.
It's pretty much ok, you can if turn off blood and gore in the settings, just a bit of swearing, no nudity, except for a giant statue in the stat of the game, but overall fine
My dad plays this game and just from watching, I have realized that there is nothing bad but the blood and language
While the violence is intense blood can be turned off under blood fx in settings and also malaka means w*nker
This game is amazing. The nudity is minuscule except for the statues but i’m sure if your child has been to a history museum than i’m sure they won’t be very new to this. In terms of cursing there is more cursing in your average pre-teens school day than throughout the play through. I haven’t ever encountered sexual content in this game and I doubt i will. This is a fun historical game that will teach even experts a thing about greek mythology. Anyway i’m sure your child over ten will have a lot of fun with this game and learn a thing or two while playing.
