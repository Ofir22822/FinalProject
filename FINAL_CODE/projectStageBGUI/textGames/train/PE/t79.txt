Wow!
Absolutely fine
Great game teaches you a lot about the world war! It is very depressing though, as you see the suffering and pain of others, and the world. It teaches you that war is not a "Fun" time. War is a time for remorse. You never actually kill anyone in this game. You hit a few German Soldiers on the head with a shovel, but it just knocks them out. But yes it is a very sad game. WARNING SPOILER COMING UP DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW! In the end your character is executed, by his own forces. As he had hit one of his own commanders on the head with a shovel out of rage, and killed him. The last picture you see in the game, is a field of white crosses stretching on for miles of all who had died. And you see your characters grave, with the dog standing next to it proudly.
Its good
The truth
I mean its not the best game since it can get quite boring easily but if you like fantasy and RPG's then I would recommend this game to you because it is ok and I mean there is a bit of gore violence but its not anything bad
I loved it and have played it several times
GREAT CO-OP Experience!
First things first, you need to play this game with friends. Without them, it becomes boring within the first hour and the game gets very challenging. It is truly meant to be a coop game. The game is technically “horror” but feels more stealth and thriller when in the middle of all the action. The prologue/tutorial is really the only scary part of the game as it is single player, has multiple jump-scares, etc. I do recommend playing the tutorial though, it is quite good. Back to the game now. The premise of The Blackout Club is that your small suburban town has been taken over by this weird supernatural power that forces all the people in the town to “blackout” and sleep walk. You play as a teenager tasked with finding evidence and exposing your eerie findings to the world and the people that don’t believe you. The game is a bit of a grind, but when you and your buddies are all strategizing about how to investigate a break-in while sleepwalking adults are out to get you, it is hard not to have an absolute blast. Exploring and uncovering the secrets of Redacre is very quite fun... especially when sh*t goes south and your tasked with escaping “The Shape” and nightmarish being that you can only see when you close your eyes. All in all, The Blackout Club is an ambitious, thrilling adventure that you have to experience with your friends by your side.
Great for kids
This is a rating of the SHOW not of the GAME!!
ignore this rating
NEEDS SERO
NOTE:This is a review of My Hero Academia anime and NOT One's Justice.
Ok
The best anime game EVER
13+ for the show/manga
I was impressed, for a while!
Really cool game!
really good!
I LOVE THIS GAME
Im 9 and love the anime blood only slightly violence but any regular kid can handle it.
(OK so I want to make this very clear this is a rating of the show! This could also be considered a rating of the manga but this is more a rating of the show) The show is wonderful it has wonderful characters abound there’s at least one character that you can relate to and love deku (aka izuku midoriya pronounced e-zu-ku me-door-ri-ya E like the E in both instances) is a wonderful person he’s kind loving hard-working determined and overall a really good person who always tries to do the best thing he’s also very intelligent he loves learning And don’t think that ua is like other superhero Schools it teaches exactly the same curriculum in the hero course except with hero training many of the students actually complain about how the other classes are boring and too much like regular school most of them get excited when hero training begins also the show promotes teamwork determination never giving up on your dreams and always trying to do the right thing Deku is one of the best role models you can ever see for your child he’s like the kid you thought you were going to have but in reality got stuck with the one you have now the kind gentle loving kid you thought you were going to have he’s every parents dream child!!! Bakugo (A.k.a. deku’s bully) is still pretty nice guy he’s hardheaded I did not very nice to deku but he is growing as a person throughout the entire story and you begin to root for him as you learn more about him he’s also posed as more of a antagonist to deku and they have a very deep and complicated history he yells a lot! And he is the main source for most of the shows cursing there are lots and lots and lots of other characters I could talk about but this would be really really long if I did so only talk about one more all might (A.k.a. basically deku’s dad) is a really good person to he also swear sometimes but he’s a grown adult man so he’s going to do that he’s a really really good teacher and someone who could easily look up to both him and deku share a strong fighting spirit and they’re both really good role models! This is really good for teenagers and preteens and it would be easy for you most likely an adult reading this to get interested the show to! It’s a good sit and watch with your kid and it would be a really good conversation starter about heroes and the villains they face and what our real world heroes do for us! And I will bid you ado by saying that shows Mato go beyond plus ultra!!!
ok but why is the game being rated but the actual show not being rated
I actually really like the game. It is a great game to play with friends. But if u don’t have any, that’s okay to because it is also fun to play alone. I do have on issue with it tho. And that is the fact that there are so many characters and SERO HANTA is not one of them. Otherwise it would be the perfect game.
I am posting my review of the My Hero Academia anime here, because this is the closest thing to the anime on this site. Anyway, I love My Hero Academia. Parents need to know that the show has a lot of superhero action, some "Traditional" anime scenes(Why do you always have to ruin everything, Mineta?!) and language. However, this show also has great characters, voice acting, animation and action.
Its a bit hard to understand if you dont read the books, and not even that fun. Meh.
really fun, some cussing
The anime and manga are way more inappropriate than the game. The anime and manga contain cleavage being blocked by only smoke, some language (bas***d, s**t, what the h**l, d**n) not too bad, and too very perverted students. The game has very little of the two being perverts, not a lot of language,and a slightly revealing outfit. I think 10+ Is ok if you're not too overprotective and definitely if the anime or manga has been consumed before. Also this game is basically Street fighter so it's based around violence. Plus, the violence is also even more ok because, calm down people it's anime. People are saying good role models are non-existent in this universe. COUGH COUGH deku COUGH COUGH todoroki COUGH COUGH shall I continue?
Now what you need to know about this game is that it’s based on an anime, so if you haven’t watched that, don’t even think about buying it. The game obviously is a fighting game so if you’re afraid of your child picking up something from physical contact, be warned. But even though the point of the game is to hurt each other, it is more comical than most games and has no blood at all. There is one “PLUS ULRA” move that is done by the Hero Killer Stain, that simulates sort of blood-ish affects splattering on the screen, but it’s not red or realistic, and you can’t actually see the cut/stab or hear gory sound effects. (Besides, if you have watched the show, it’s kinda his thing) There is minimal, low-grade cursing like “Damn” or “Hell” but that’s not very often. It’s not super easy to control, but at least it’s not Dark Souls. You have to combo, but you do that by clicking a button in rapid succession (not super fast.) The “PLUS ULTRA” moves are kinda hard to maneuver, seeing as you have to hold down both triggers while pressing Y/X/Square or A/B/Circle. Gameplay-wise, it will keep you entertained for about 10-20 hours, unless you want some Online/Mission action. Missions should keep you around 5-8 more hours in, while Online is as interesting as you want it to be. Over all I would say 9/10 must-play for fans of the series and Anime all tougher.
Get it if you enjoy the manga/anime and love fighting games.
me and my friend played this and it was a very well made game. it's violence is like super smash bros, there isn't any blood really and it's very flashy and dragon ball like. great for fans of the tv show
THIS GAME IS AMAZING. THE ANIME IS GREAT APPEALS TO TEENS NO CURSING
Definitely not for very young kids
Amazing game no worse than Tombstone
Good for 13 and over.
Bad themes used in moderation
Not bad at all
Really great game, not for kids.
Not for younger teens and children.
One of the Best Games of 2018
Its pretty good, but stretched at some parts
Not for children
Your choices depend on the game
A Masterpiece of a Game
If your kids can handle swearing and violence you should probably be alright
Great game. Maybe not for young kids
Greatest game ever
Great game but 16+
An absolutely Amazing experience!
If your fine with gore it's Ok!
Read dead online
Cimpared to gta 5, this game is more better
I’m 16 and I think that although there is a lot of blood and some strong swearing it’s not too much. There is one scene with partial nudity and another one where a woman is about to be raped but the player stops the man before he can. Based on how you treat other people the game can become harder because if you do a good deed you will normally get rewarded but if you kill someone then their friends or family can hunt you down. The player can’t engage in any sexual acts but people speak of sex around the towns and camps.
This game isn't as bad as you'd think for a game made made by rockstar (They Made Grand Theft Auto 5). It's actually very clean and there's more you can do to clean it, I'll get to that at the end... So first it all depends on what you plan on doing if your child plans on killing the whole town I wouldn't let them play. But if you're like me and like to try to take a non violent approach you can try ( it is very hard) or you can just ignore both and explore the beautiful world. first you'll have to do the intro which you are forced to kill some people but after that you can choose your own path. Now for the actual ratings, Violence. (6/10) There is gun fights, fist fights, and possible harm to animals Horses, dogs, ect. You could also simply lasso and hog-tie enemies... (Tip) you can pur your guns away in storage and you won't have the opportunity to use them. Gore (8/10) Gore is mostly the players choice for instance you can lay people on the train tracks and wait for a train, this is the most gory thing in the game, besides point blanking someone with a shot gun. also in the intro you see a dead horse with guts if you look closely but you can easily miss it. (Tip 2) look left to not see it. And lastly a slo-mo kill cam Language (3/10) For a M game it's nothing The main word is B*stard I've seen S*it twice. Sex (1/10) I've seen no nudity all I can think about is in one scene you pee in first person but you can't see anything. Drugs and alcohol (8/10) In almost every cutscene someone has a cigarette, cigar ect you can also get drunk at a saloon. Also you can take alcohol in your bag and drink whenever. That's about it Now as I mentioned before you can Disable the slo-mo kill cam in settings and also turn off subtitles in settings. Overall I think if you trust your kids will do good you should let them play just for the fact this is such a good game to miss the opportunity to play.
This game has lots of violence, but way less violent than something like kingsman or deadpool. There are only a few mentions of anything sexual. There is a scene where you save somebody from being sexually assulted, but the assulter dies before he can do it. The swear words are used little times, but when they are they have actual meaning like if somebody is extremely angry.
I'm a kid so call me biased, but this game obviously shows that the main character shows remorse after he kills people, is apprehensive before starting heists and tells other people he's a terrible man. Unlike GTAV which glorifies violence and swearing, this only swears when it would add to the story (when they're being shot at or are particularly angry) and violence isn't glorified or gratuitous. Both are obviously very frequent, but it's not going to encourage a kid who is already familiar with these themes to copy them. There's infrequent sexual references, but nothing bad. In fact, the only explicit sex is when the player saves a woman from being raped. There's use of drugs and alcohol, but again, it's not encouraging anyone to do the same, and most drugs you take in the game have negative side-effects. I knew about all these themes years ago, but I don't think as a parent I would be comfortable with a kid playing this game until s/he was 14-15.
Nothing bad at all but a little swearing.
This is defiantly one of the best games to come out this year, although. It is not suitable for kids. Not only is there an excess amount of swearing and violence, there are also some parts with strippers/prostitutes that can be found completely naked. The controls are also pretty difficult and require the player to make a few difficult choices during the game that the kids may ignore and ruin their experience for them. Otherwise, I would say if you are 14+, and the parents are fine with the child seeing naked people and swearing in games, this game is completely worth it.
This game is really quite violent with occasional slow motion close ups of you shooting off your foes limbs. occasional nudity and sex but rare. it is also not the easiest game to play for younger children. Absolutely amazing graphics, which can be a problem when your face is being mauled by a bear. A lot of bad language.
I believe that this game is amazing (as well as many other people) but I think it is a matter of your child's maturity. There is barely any "nudity" in the game from what I have seen so far playing around 30 hours in the game in total. There is decent amount of language, but mostly go***amnit and sh*t, as you would expect from a game about a group of outlaws in the wild west. There is less language than a middle school child would hear at school or when hanging out with their friends. There is a lot of tobacco, as your character can choose to smoke cigarettes and drink. Your character can also get drunk. There is no sexy stuff and the violence is apparent (again as you would expect from a game about outlaws). Blood is easily noticeable but it is not glorified or over gory. Overall, it is an amazing game and your child would regret missing out on the opportunity to play it.
Note: I haven’t finished the game but I can say that its really good. Anyway, as for the rating I agree it is pretty mature with lots of blood and some gore, use of cigars, alcohol, and other things and there is a lot of language but despite what you might see, theres no nudity. It says there is but from what ive seen its fine. The game is packed full of action however some of it is kinda random and theres a lot of stuff going on and it may be a bit stretched too far, but overall its a good game and I would recommend it to anyone 15 or 16 and up (besides me cuz im cool)
I’m only about 4 hours in to this 85 hour long game and I can already tell that this, like most rockstar games, is not for kids. This game includes superfluous nudity and gratuitous violence. There are multiple sexual references and acts depicted, including threatening to cut a mans balls off only about 2 hours in, and in one mission, the player character gets drunk with a friend and the friend runs off, so the player has to search throughout the saloon to find him, now I was pretty thorough with my search and went through every door in the building, and behind one of the doors I mistakenly walked in on a couple going to town in a bedroom. Some of the violence in this game includes, stabbing, hanging, shooting, and also blowing people’s limbs off. This game is not at all for children. But there are some good things though, nothing is more important to the characters than the bond of his friends.
Red dead redemption is a great game the graphics, physics, storyline it’s just amazing. I also like how in red dead redemption the game is set in the early days of America so now days kids can get a feel of what it was like. In the game you are in a gang that seems bad but how that changes is you can be riding your horse and a stranger will need a ride if you refuse you will loose trust so you are givin choices so depending on how you choose to handle them that’s the way people will see you. But I will say the violence would be for teens because it can get very disturbing
First off, this game is a work of art. The way that the main story is over 60 hrs long and yet it never feels repetitive or boring is amazing. On the content part of things, for a Rockstar game it is incredibly tame. There is way less language than I thought, and it is only when they are really mad. The violence is fairly bloody but it is not senseless violence, and the character often feels remorse afterword. There is one scene that I have seen so far where the character gets blackout drunk, and they smoke cigars but other than that, there is not much. Overall, this is the best Open World game of all time and will hold that title for many years.
A mature 11 year old could probably handle this, as they will have heard most of the language in it before and most violence will have negative repercussions, discouraging you from doing it. There are very few sexual scenes, but your character cannot engage in sex himself, however there is gambling with the in-game currency as you can play games such as poker with your friends. Your character can drink alchohol or chew tabacco, and there is cocaine gum which he can chew but it will have mostly negative effects on the character
It is a very intense game with a fair bit of swearing a lot of violence. There is also use of alcohol and tobaco. Great game. Recommend to anyone over the age of 14 atleast. Or maybe younger if there is an adult or someone that can explain troubling topics.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. I've beat the game multiple times and each time, I am so impressed with the overall game. There is no nudity except for one scene which is about 2 seconds long. In the game, you can choose whether to be honorable or dishonorable. Each choice you make can affect your game experience. I've played as honorable and dishonorable, and I can say with confidence that both paths are amazing. While it is more fun to be a bandit and just do whatever you want, it is more rewarding in the end to be the honorable player. In the game, some common things to do are hunt, fish, be a bounty hunter, and unlock things such as weapons, and accessories. There are also side missions along with the regular missions. A typical side mission, is meeting a stranger, and doing things for them. A regular mission is usually robbing people, or helping them. Sometimes you get to decide your actions, and sometimes it is required that you don't spare or help them. If you commit crimes near people, such as robbery, they will become a witness and will report you to the local law. You can stop them however by threatening them. In Red Dead Redemption, you use horses to travel. There are also trains and stagecoaches too. You can buy horses, steal them from others, and catch wild ones. Some horses are very valuable and can cost a lot and some will be very cheap. As you continue to be with your horse, your bond with it will grow. If you and your horse get into trouble and it gets shot, you will have to use horse reviver to heal it. If you don't have any on you, then you might have to give up your horse. In the game, you are running from the law with your gang. You must set up camps across America to stay away from them. Each time you interact with your gang members, your bond with them grows. You can upgrade your camp supplies by using money you earn to upgrade it. You can contribute supplies to the gang such as food, and money to help fund for everything. You can hunt for food for the gang such as deer and rabbits which are very common animals seen across America. There are legendary animals in the game which you can craft into pelts to use for clothing. There are also legendary fish which you can send to people for a reward. If you hunt the legendary ram, you can make a hat and pants out of it. There are also other rival gangs you can interact with, although they won't be too friendly towards you and might start shooting at you. If your health is draining, you can use health cures to bring it back up. You can also use dead eye to hit vulnerable areas on your target such as the head and chest. There are also shops that you can go into to buy things. The general store has everything from food, to clothing. The gunsmith has weapons such as pistols, shotguns, rifles and ammunition. You can also go to the doctors to get medicine. There are many small towns in Red Dead Redemption 2 along with a city called Saint Denis. If you are caught committing a crime, you have a chance to surrender to the law. If you don't surrender in time, they will start shooting you and won't stop until you're dead. The longer you keep up a fight with the law, the higher up your bounty will be. As long as you have a bounty, you will be hunted by bounty hunters. If you see any of them near you, you can escape or shoot them. Smoking and drinking are optional in this game, except for a few missions which might require it. There are many people in the game that you can interact with. You can greet them, antagonize them, or rob them.You can also shoot them, although the law shows up pretty fast if you're in a town. The wildlife in Red Dead Redemption 2 is outstanding, and there's always something new to discover. You can pick plants and herbs, such as english mace, Indian tobacco, and ginseng. Hunting animals and fishing provides food for you and your camp. The major theme in Red Dead Redemption 2 is loyalty. All in all, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an outstanding game, and I've never regretted getting it and I can't recommend it enough.
this game is really good but not for children under 16
I’m 11 years old and have to say that this game is outstanding for pre teens. It simply teaches the consequences of crime and the punishments you can receive if preformed. The game is “NOT” bad! The story revolves around a gang searching for a safe place to hide out after a failed robbery, but while the gang koves from place to place they successfully save 9 families from freezing to death. During the course of the story the gang helps others while also robbing/killing some people. The only reason, though, the gang does this once again is to provide food for the settlers they saved. By the end of the story the main protagonist realizes that crime, no matter what, is bad while the leader slowly loses faith. The ending shows redemption and why never to commit crime. But... there are a few scenes where evil is presented. In one scene a gang memeber runs into a house and murders a family just to get his back while you stand outside and listen. Another scene shows the gang leader go into a house and kill a mothers 23 year old son off screen. The mother shouts in distress as the gang drags her away. If your child is mature enough to understand the point of the story and the innocence of the ending, then keep the game away. But if your child loves fun gameplay (you spend most of your time doing non-violent activities) and a great story, This is a game to buy. Also keep in mind that there is some foul language such as Sh*t, A**, H*ell, and around 4 uses of F*ck in the entire 66 hour long story. I hope this helped out.
This is an amazing game which my elder brother (18) introduced me to and since then I have had a blast! The free roam mixed with story constantly keeps your attention and the graphics are great! The gore is the main point of concern but at 13 most kids (in my experience) will be getting used to games like this and start playing more and more of them. The language is similar to what you will find in a playground and there is very little nudity. As long as you know that it is just a game and that it shouldn't be recreated in real life then this game is really ok for most teens.
This is a great game as far as the campaign but read dead online is very hard as anyone can kill you that’s why it’s 14+
it's a cool shooting game. but gta 5 is worse i can tell you
