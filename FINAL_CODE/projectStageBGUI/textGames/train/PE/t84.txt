Amazing Game
despite the corse language and a bit of nudity it’s fine but you only see bad think when you go and do them so at first keep an eye on your kids but I’m sure they will love it it’s a great game and there is so much to do and if your children do bad think it’s up to you about what you do about it because lots of games have things that you can do but you shouldn’t to so I think it’s a great game for kids.
There is a decent amount of swearing I've only heard stuff like b*tch and b*stars the are bank robberies and store robberies but you don't have to do those things the gore is not much but if you hogtie someone and run them over with a train or shotgun their limbs off they will show some gore the only times I've seen any sex or nudity was once or twice but that is in the campaign and it was only for a split second you can just play online with your friends and avoid most of the other things
The game is beautiful, and it would be cruel to not let them play it. It's definitely one of the best games of all time, and you should let your mature 12/13+ play this game in a time when they can appreciate the graphics. Just the little things you can do... it's amazing. Things parents should know: Violence. It's a Western. If you don't want your kid seeing violence, you don't want your kid playing this game. Disturbing images. There are 2 that come to mind, 3 if you play with low honor. a decapitated gang member holding his head in his hands. decapitated bodies with blood and organs on the ground, with messages nearby like "look what I did" these bodies are for a quest where you track down a serial killer, but you will stumble upon them accidentally. and many more... random mutilated bodies, these people were killed by the nightfolk, who are a band of ... zombie people. they in themselves look super disturbing. as well as later in the game, the skinner brothers, bring waaay more of that. cannibalism. the Aberdeen pig barn family is a brother and sister who are romantically involved and killed and ate there mother. random creepy/interesting Easter eggs. (ive found a ufo, a vampire, a ghost, a werewolf...a weird... pig thing with wings... yeah ive spent a lot of time playing this game.) your main character can smoke, take "drugs" and drink. you cannot pick up a prostitute as far as i know. listing all these things makes it sound horribly inappropriate, but the game is filled with wonderful things. Hunting, wild horse breaking, fishing, even drinking coffee. if you dont want your kid playing this, then YOU should play this.
This game is a masterpiece, definitely more effort put into it than GTA V. The scenery is amazing, well, the graphics and quality in general is INCREDIBLE. When playing the Red Dead Redemption II Story, aside from missions that require you to kill or rob, you have the choice to either run around becoming an outlaw or to just mind your own business.
In red dead redemption 2 ( red dead ) the characters will some curse at one another and other people using words like Fu*k, Sh*t, Bi*ch, A**, and in ONE case N*gger lover. This words are not used a lot through but you will hear them being used. In Red dead online your character will not talk so you will not be hearing cursing in red dead online unless its from other people.
The night before Read Dead 2 released, I decided to look into the game a bit more as I was relatively uninterested in it before then. My brother managed to get a hold of the game the night before the worldwide release, and he convinced me to get it. The next day after school I decided to go to GameStop with my mother and I picked up the game. I was pretty excited to play the game after what I had heard. I was never really interested in old west guns or guns in general, but now I can't get enough of them! Read Dead Redemption 2 is truly one of the best video games that has ever been released. The storytelling in this game is just incredible. You play as Arthur Morgan, an outlaw running with the notorious gang known as The Sons of Dutch. The rest of the story is yours to find out. The world is sprawling, and it's easy to get yourself lost in the sheer beauty of all of it. There is so much land to explore, after 9 months of playing the game I still find myself finding new things. As for the content that gave the game its 'M' rating, the nudity is completely avoidable. The only time I saw anything that could be considered 'nudity' was in the mission 'A Quiet Time' when you walk into a hotel room looking for your friend Lenny, and find a man and a prostitute preparing to have sex. You don't actually see anybody's privates, but since people are offended by every little thing nowadays it seems, Rockstar had to put the nudity content descriptor for the game. Language is actually pretty tame for an M rated game. I heard plenty of 'b*stard', 'sh*t,' 'hell', and 'damn', and throughout the whole game I only heard the F word said about 5 times, mostly by Sean MacGuire, an Irish man in your gang. The violence is pretty typical for a shooter game. If you have any type of shotgun and shoot somebody in the head, their head will explode, along with any other limbs that you shoot. It's not horrible; it's a bit gory but it really doesn't bother me. Apart from that, shooting people mostly just results in a bullet wound wherever you hit them. Not that bad. There are weapons likes knifes and machetes in the game and you can stab people with them, but I was surprised with the lack of gore. Just a bit of blood and down they go. I am a BIG fan of the honor meter in the game. Basically, it goes like this: if you do good actions, you are known as a good man. If you do bad actions, you will be known as a bad man. I also feel some sympathy for the NPCs in the game. In most games, I would have no problem beating up a random guy on the street. But in Read Dead 2, whenever I get the urge to punch some random person, I sort of feel bad for them before I even do it. The fact that these NPCs feel so real, and alive makes me feel bad if I do bad things to them. Honestly, this game has some good messages to it. As Dutch, the gang leader decides to make some evil choices, Arthur recognizes it. Arthur sees what's right, and while he does bad things, he tries to redeem himself by helping out people who have no one to help them. This game really sent me the message to help people whenever I can. As you can tell by this long winded review, Red Dead 2 is a great game with some pretty good messages in it. If your kid is interested in the Old West and they're starting to get a bit older, this is a great representation.
The gore is a bit over the top with it, however you can choose how to play the game, You can also choose the sexy stuff in it and even if you do it isn't bad. The one thing I will say is there is a lot of drunk alcoholic stuff in the game. swearing can also be muted
Very very gripping western tale that will have you playing it for hours. But keep in mind it is a rockstar game and they don’t EVER hold back. Violence is gruesome and brutal. Language is actually not as bad as the other rockstar games. Lots of smoking and alcohol abuse. A couple scenes of on screen nudity and one of a sexual act that is seen briefly. Overall this game is a must have, amazing characters and gripping story. Definitely keep your eyes open for this one.
The swearing isn't something I haven't heard in middle school a million times and they keep it to a minimum (for the wild west). You can decide what you see (nudity, excess violence). The game doesn't force you to tie someone to the train tracks but you can. It doesn't tell you to walk into peoples hotel room while it's closed and watch them. But you can and that is what warrants the mature rating. In general I think a mature kid or teen can play this. It has an incredible storyline and somewhat displays what the wild west was like. It's a incredible game and if you don't let your kid play then they are really missing out.
This game is a beautiful game if you’re mature enough to handle it, missions will constantly end in bloody shoot outs which most of the time are fine but can occasionally be graphic depending on your weapon. Arthur Morgan is of a Antihero, he does wrong things and knows and acknowledges it but throughout the game we see him trying to do what he thinks is right. Depending on how you play the game you can choose to be an honorable outlaw or a unhonorable outlaw, this means you can help or hurt people. Language is pretty over rated by common sense media, yes it contains cussing but over the long campaign you’ll probably only hear big curse words like the f bomb or the n word a few times. An optional mission called “the artists way” contains nudity but it is optional and you do not have to play it. Characters will drink and smoke and at times get drunk though this does not occur too often. All and all this is a great game for those mature enough to handle the themes and is a definite must play.
There is a little bit of blood and some characters says F**k,S**t and N****r You can insult the cavalry and some people and they shoot you or punch you, but you can punch back to them, but if you do too much violence the cavalry comes after you and you are dead! You can also get drunk and if you get drunk the world is seems blurry
Absolutely amazing game. 10/10. Great cast, graphics, story, etc. It really took time and effort to make. You play as an outlaw who does what he can to help his friends. Even though he may do bad things, he is a great man. He turns into pure good, and [spoiler] he dies in the end, and people remember him as a good person (if you choose to do good things).
The game is one of the best I’ve played, possibly the best. The graphics are quite realistic, meaning there will be blood. There are some old fashioned swear words but nothing too bad.
I got this game in January and I played it till the end of the day. The story is amazing, the dialog is amazing, really everything is amazing about it. It genuinely is a great game.
My favorite game. First there are good role models and has justice and redemption I mean of course, it is in the name lol. The violence you can shoot peoples head off and you can die by carnivores in the woods or swamps. The sex, nothing to worry about, common sense lied, there are zero prostitutes the only thing that is bad is the deluxe bath. The language is bad but I herd no n word through the whole story. The language there is beer, tobacco, cocaine gum, and cigarettes. But a really good story. I cried at the end.
I enjoyed Red Dead II far more than the first game. The story and characters were more engaging in this one than the previous game. Violence is intense and graphic. Bodies are left rotten, blood and gore spurts and stains the environment, and horses are killed, as well as shearing animals. Language is strong like you would expect from a western; f#!k, $h!t and N***a. Sexuality is a minor factor. Characters frankly talk about sex at times and there is also a secret cutscene where a woman is seen fully naked but only her butt us shown. Drugs and alcohol is expected.
The game is so clean only one sex scene it’s rated mature because the use of Violence, Tabacco stuff, drinking and dirty words
Great game, but lots of swearing, violence and gore. One random encounter with a naked man. Other than that though it’s a super fun game.
These reviews are very misleading in what this game entails, it follows the protagonist Arthur Morgan and his journey to be a better man after he finds out devastating news, (no spoilers) sure there is plenty of violence (which is present in any action movie) and horse genitalia but there’s no nudity in the game besides if you stumble upon a random thing in a mission with Lenny (Arthur’s friend) which has no nudity but implies they were doing intercourse
This game is appropriate for a mature 12 year old , there’s shooting and a good story line but one part of nudity at the end. This part shows the girls right boob and the boys right butt cheek
Amazing. Simply Amazing.

Nothing bad to say
This game has violence. There is no doubt about it, and though it is graphic, most times it is hard to see or far away. The reason I rated this game 16+ is because of the themes, as they are difficult for younger people to understand. They consist of corruption, lying to yourself, and much more mature themes that are hard to get if your not a mature teen. The story follows Arthur Morgan who at first is, well, a bad person. As the story progresses you'll see Dutch through Arthur's eyes, and through them you'll see his slow decent into madness. Micah is WAY to complicated for kids to understand if they're not WAY beyond their years. Also the story is so long and slow moving that a lot of adults probably can't get through it. (though they should, as it is amazing) There are also themes of sexual assault that again are too mature for children to get. Arthur is also very flawed as he never leaves the gang because he has grown a dependence on them. This game is not easy to play either, there are a ton of systems to keep track of, and it feels annoying at times. If your horse falls off of a cliff or is shot it will die, and in certain circumstances you will have to put it out of its misery. There is also racial slurs thrown around quite a lot. John's fathering at the beginning are also too complex for children to truly understand. This game is objectively the best game of all time, but also very mature and slow moving.
This is one of the best story based games I have played before. The game has amazing characters and the characters don't swear that often. The most common word you will here is dam*it but sometimes during missions or open world activities worse will be used. The trickiest thing about rating this game is, within the game, the character you play as can either be a good man or a bad man. The game uses an "honor scale", you can either go around robbing, shooting, and mugging innocent people, which will cause your honor to go down, and therefore become more of a bad person. Or you can go around helping the poor, saving people from death, and helping them get back home after their horse was killed and your honor will go up, causing you to become a good person. So the better person you are the better role model you are, but if you are a bad person then not so much of a good role model for your kids. Now for the worst parts of the game: there is a mission in which one of your gang members gets taken to prison and one escapes. Since he is panicking you are asked to take him to a bar. Once you get to the bar you start getting drunk until you can't make sense of who is who and everyone ends up looking like your friend. As you search around for your friend trying to find him through the bar you end up entering a room where there is a fully naked woman on top of a man. She covers her self up before you are able to really see her, but it's still a very noticeable scene. Secondly, even before and after this mission is done, just running around town women will ask you if you want some company or if you want to have a good time. I've never attempted to accept, but I don't even think it's possible to accept. It's just an aesthetic that's there throughout the game. Now for the game itself, it's pretty hard... the game does teach you the controls and how to play, but it pretty much throws you to the wolves after you reach the 2nd chapter of the game, which is when the game really starts. Basically the end of the tutorial. Your horse is also a must have through the entire game. When I first got it I thought I was gonna forget my horse often and just walk everywhere. But no, you don't leave your horse. It's like forgetting your car when taking a vacation. If you don't have your horse it could take 20+ minutes to get to the next town. And if your horse dies from falling or getting shot well you might as well load your last save because without your horse you're not going to get anywhere. You must also take care of your horse by keeping it fed, grooming it, and petting it here and there to increase your bond with your horse. Over all the game isn't too bad. The hardest part being figuring out what to do in the beginning, but once you figure everything out the game turns into a very fun experience.
This game is the best. It is a really good game but you are probably wondering wheter your child should play it. I say yes. The game has no s_x stuff aside from one stranger encounter called the art of(i forget the rest of the name). Violence wise there is some mild blood. You can commit crimes but the cops come after you and send you to jail which takes all of your in-game money. There is a ton of cursing in the game. Anything up to the level of F words are in the game. The thing is your child has heard all of these words at school. The game teaches you to be good, not bad because you will get a good ending if you are good. I beg you to let your kids play it it is for the better.
People Assume this game would be bad (keep reading) because its made by rockstar which are not kid friendly game designers BUT... it teaches kids about some animals and how outlaws were back then, also mentions civil rights, womens rights, and other things. Now yes this has sex and bad things in it but just know that every game could be like that.
OK! Parental stuff first, like always! So violence? Yes, definitely. This game is even more violent than GTA5. It shows old-Western style gunfights, with things like tomahawks and rifles from the 1890s. The violence is quite intense, with you being able to kill citizens and lawmen alike, alongside other gangsters (there can be quite epic gang shootouts). It also shows people getting killed in slow motion as blood gushes out of their wounds. Also, most of the time, there's hordes of blood left when you shoot someone. Sex? Not too much. It does show characters bathing, though never shows sensitive parts. There may be some references, but there isn't much nudity. Swearing? It's quite far from as frequent as GTA5, though there is still uses of "sh-t", "f-ck" and "n-gger" and other such used at that time. Drinking, drugs and smoking? Yes. You can drink and smoke various things. You can also even get blurry vision or pass out from drinking. There's this one Dutch mission I played where I got drunk and it kind of got funny as to how drunk I was. Consumerism? None, except that the first Red Dead Redemption was very successful, and the one before that? It's a PS2 game. No need to worry. Role models and messages? Arthur's a more likeable character, for even though he does bad things, he recognizes what he's done and feels guilt for it, and will have a hard time choosing between his gang and doing the right thing. Messages? Nah. It altogether glamorizes the outlaw life and gives you rewards for getting away with crime, like GTA does. Ease of play? If your familiar with GTA, then you'll most likely get the hang of this. The controls are very similar, and the driving, in my opinion, is easier. So yeah, quite nice. What's it about? The story mode is a prequel to the first RDR, revolving around John Marston's gang, and you controlling Arthur. It takes place in the Old West in 1899, with the Wild West coming to an end. After a bank robbery goes badly, the gang must flee from their town and fight for their survival. The Online Mode is like GTA5's, though worse. It allows you to create your character and go on missions and explore the massive open world RDR2 presents to you. Yes, it is brilliant not only in my opinion, but it ups everything in gaming. It's super realistic, with practically nothing you can't do! Sometimes it can feel a little "too" realistic though it's amazing. The story's awesome, though Online's sorta flawed. I recommend it for ages 16+. I mean, I can see why Common Sense says 18+, but to think it should only be played by adults is nonsense, because there's a hell load more mature stuff out there. Thanks!
RDR2 is a great game to play. There is a ton of swearing in the game. I've never heard the n word so far. There is an Irish man that says the f word once or twice but besides that it's mainly S**t, b**ch, and damn. There is a lot of smoking in the game. In almost every cutscene someone is smoking. But remember that it's 1899. There is one mission where you get drunk and the screen spins a bunch. This game is for kids 15 and up
I dont like kids
There is violence, sex, smoking, alcohol, but here is the catch. The game features many violent scenes with decapitation and dismemberment, but if your kid is mature enough they can handle hit. The game also has a lot of good role models, such as the main character trying to do whats right for his friends. He makes many sacrifices for his gang and his friends. There is one sex scene in the game, but it's your choice to do. In one mission you're in a saloon and if you walk into to one of the rooms you will see a brief glimpse of a couple having sex. The child should be used to to swearing it happens a lot at school. Overall if your child is mature they should be able to handle it.
the best game ive ever plaed now its got great messages great role models there is a in game thing called dead eye makes the game super easy the most violent thing you can do in the game is blow someones head and limbs off with explosives and shot guns the only thing that could fall under the sex category is when you get a bath nothing is shown but when he leaves the bath you can see his butt for like 3 seconds you have to go get debts from people you CAN drink bourbon rum so on and you CAN smoke cigs and cigars there is drugs mainly cocaine and it is accurate it was legal and common (its mainly optional)
honestly this one if not THE best game I have ever played and I recommend it to anyone who has a love of amazing graphics wonderful gameplay and an all around great story so if any of what I just said interests you I recommend it but you should be aware that there is a lot of violence/blood and gore also there is drinking and smoking and a lot of swearing also having played the whole game I can tell you THERE IS NO NUDITY also
This game missing super appropriate option, so Call of Duty Black Ops 4 has a super appropriate option. Still inappropriate for under 17 years old.
Hi, I think this game is okay for a mature 13 year old because the content is not as bad as you may think. I have beaten the main story and have beaten the epilogue so I know what I’m talking about. The violence in this game is pretty tame compared to games such as doom or fallout. This game is made by the same people who made grand theft auto yet is much more appropriate for teens. There is no human nudity and the sexual content is a part of the game where there is a male on top of a man. No nudity is shown and you don’t have to go into that room. It’s in the mission with Lenny in the bar. The bad language consists of “f*ck, sh*t, bi*tch, bastered. The n word is used once. The drinking and drugs in this game is to be expected saying it’s a western. You can get drunk but you do not have to. Smoking will restore dead eye. The games story is magnificent and it would be a shame for someone to miss out on it because of the (In my opinion) inaccuracte rating. The game is quite mild for a mature game. If you let your kids watch westerns, this game will be fine got them. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you decide.
This game has few qualities to justify an "M" rating. Sure, there is a lot of violence, some sexual references, alcohol, and cigarettes, but the main character, Arthur Morgan, is trying to redeem himself for all of the wrong he has done. One can choose to be honorable or dishonorable, but the canonical option is probably the former, shown by the way Arthur Morgan starts acting later in the game. There is very little cursing in this game, only spoken by a couple of people prominently.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a good game with an entertaining plot. You play as Arthur Morgan, an anti-hero who tries to help out his gang with running away from the dangerous life they live in. They often rob and make enemies with rich people of the city. Arthur and his gang usually need to flee the city after a bank robbery or mission that would raise their bounty high. As far as sex is concern, a single scene exists where you can see a couple having sex. The scene isn't necessary to watch, and also can be avoided. Arthur and Dutch may be considered role models for their heroic actions for the gang. The problem is his heroic actions usually consist of robbing banks. A message that could be taken from RDR2 is to do whatever it takes to help out your family. The controls are difficult to use at first, but gradually, it becomes second nature. Aiming is easy, and auto-aim is on. Swearing is bad; sh*t is said occasionally, while f*ck is a little less common. A black man refers to himself as a n***er, and that is said only once in the entire game. Smoking and Alcohol: Cigars and cigarettes can be bought and smoked, and alcohol can also be consumed. 2 (if I remember correctly) scenes exist where Arthur gets drunk in the story. Arthur can get drunk if he consumes a large amount of alcohol. One city is owned by a man who is greedy and sets up the gang to kill them. He also owns a black market type of business.
Yes 12 may seem young but this is pretty much America's history. There isn't much sex in the game I bet your child watches porn all the time. Alcohol and Cigs and cussing is everywhere in todays society
It is excellent. Amazingly acted characters and great storyline. There is a lot of violence Heads can be shot off and lots of shooting Stabbing and lassos. Smoking lots and drinking. There is a gum called cocaine gum. Some prostitutes may ask for assistance but the player can only decline or reject. Briefly naked shot of two people. Some language but not nearly As much as other games and films. Hateable characters (like Micah)
First off the story, writing and music is some of the best I have ever seen, and I have played a lot of games. The game play and weapons are a bit repetitive but like I said the story, writing and music make up for any fault. This is a must buy for any good time
Although it’s can be slightly dark and sad, this has to be my favourite game off all time, it has amazing characters that you get attached to and the story is fantastic , and that’s an understatement. All and all I think this is appropriate for mature middle aged teens.
