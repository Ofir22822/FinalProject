Breathtaking Western Masterpiece — Red Dead Redemption 2 | Video-Game Review
Great game
Not as bad as people say
It is truly a great game. It really shows how your actions affect yourself and others. The ending is sad. There is violence, swearing, and smoking but it takes place in 1899. If you don't want your kid playing a violent game then you're overbearing. Playing a violent game won't make them evil or bad. Being too protective can be a bad thing. Take care of your kids but don't be a nuisance. Let them explore. The moral is your actions will affect yourself and others. Your choices will change the ending. If you act with honor you will have a better ending. If you do honorable acts throughout the game the ending will be Arthur's Redemption.
so this game is fine for kids 6 and up it has great messages 18!!!! what are they talking about!!!!!!!!!!
I'm gonna start off saying that this is the best game I've played in a long time, but it earns its rating of M. In the game, you play as a gang member so you're going to be doing some bad stuff. Lots of western-style shootouts to be had, and some of your best kills are slowed down to show the killing of your enemy, which shows quite a bit of blood. There is swearing thrown around a lot, but usually to better show emotion. You cannot do anything sexual, but some women clearly show as prostitutes, there is a lot of sex talk, and you can walk in on two people in a saloon. The game is very slowly paced so this could be a turn off for younger gamers.
Listen there are guns and stuff but this is wild west.It has messages but has alot of violance in some gun fights with bounty hunters and odriscols.Now i believe if your10 + kid doesent get scared allot go and get it
*SPOILERS* As you go on a journey as Arthur Morgan with a gang of outlaws you get feeling all the way through the story mode. In Chapter 2 after leaving the cold mountains you are free to explore this vast world and your just starting to connect with the characters. Dutch van der linde was like a father figure to me at the beggining of the game I thought he was going to give the gang a happy ending. Towards Chapter 4-6 When the gang fell apart and I felt devastated by Hosea's death since he was also like a father. Then Guarma happened The gang escapes and a brilliant soundtrack plays when arthur returns to camp for his gang that explains Arthur's troubles. When he gets to camp everyone is gone and it turns out they were north of the city of Saint Denis in a swampy village called lakay. long story short Arthur gets there, Sadie adler saved everyone, A shootout between the gang and pinkertons breakout. Then chapter 6 when arthur is diagnosed woth Tuberculosis from beating a man over a debt. Arthur realises he doesn't have much time left and with a rat in the gang Arthur must redeem himself as a 'Good man'. Arthur can do more debts for Strauss but only absolve them as the debts are what caused him to be a dead man walking. Arthur kicks Strauss out of camp, Pearson and uncle already left the gang before it got worse. Micah is starting to show his true colors when he starts being around Dutch more often, turning Dutch against Arthur . And at this point I stop looking up to Dutch and start depending on myself to make Arthur a good man and to save the gang. Then, the train heist happens John is shot in the arm Dutch goes back with Michah and claims 'John didn't make it' soon after the train heist which was succeful and now the gang has enough moey to run away from America. When they get to camp Tilly Jackson has Jack(Johns Son) on a horse saying THEY TOOK ABIGAIl. The gang learns Abigail( Johns's wife) was kidnapped by the Pinkertons Michah convinces Dutch that Abigail is just a girl, but Arthur and Sadie try to convince Dutch to go back for her in van horn. But, the gang rides back to camp and Arthyr and Adie retrieve Abigail after a long shootout and Murdering Agent Milton wich Milton said Micah was the rat. After they get away Arthur sends Sadie and Abigail to copperhead landing to get them away from the gang. Arthur then goes to ride back ro the gang which is the saddest cinematic apart from his death when a song plays about the tragedy of gang. Arthur confronts Micah for being the rat. It becomes a stand off between Arthur and Micah trying to convince Dutch who's lying. It ends with John coming back and Ms. Grimshaw dead John is the only one on Arthur's side as Pinkertons shoot at the gang. They run away in the the cave and get out to run away on their horses. They end up getting their horses shot by Pinkertons and after shooting 3 of the Pinkertons Arthur says, "Thank you" to his loyal horse as it passes away. John keeps running up the mountain and Arthur says, "What about the money?" Then you get the choice to go back for the money or to help John. In the name of redemption I helped John get to safetey while Micah beat the crap out of Arthur. Arthur pulls out a gun but Micah grabs it and Arthur hits him with it and they fall over Arthyr is now crwling towards the gun to kill Micah, but dutch steps on his hand and says, "It's over Arthur it's All over" Then Arthyr tells Dutch how Micah as the rat an how he tried hard to be loyal to the gang. While Micah tells Dutch that Arthur is lying. Dutch Abandons them both and with Arthur being honorable and being a 'Good man' not even Micah finishes him. Arthur crawls toward a rock and Lays down as a song plays and he stops breathing right up front of a sunrise. I cried then realizd I have done the right thing and gave Arthur his Redemption. 10/10
It’s just a western stile game trying to be as realistic as possible. It isn’t as bad as what really happened back in the western days You can’t be tortured you can’t lose everything It’s just a game
I like it. Some violence and cursing. Not that much.
I like it. Some violence and cursing. Not that much.
This game is a work of art. After getting a ps4 for my birthday I worked hard for a month to convince my mom to let me get this game. It is the best purchase I have ever made. From the dry desert in tumbleweed and the muddy dirty town of valentine to the fancy and grand city of saint denis there is countless things to do. Yes there is blood and cursing but nothing too too bad. And trust me I hear way worse in school. The graphics are amazing and its so cool to cut and style arthur/John's hair. Choose their outfits and horses. The story is amazing and honestly I was crying by the end of chapter six. YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME!!!
Red dead redemption is a very good game with a beautiful western universe. Despite its qualities, it is also very violent and mustn’t be used by people under 16. The language is also very violent. The online mode is not as good as the story mode but is acceptable.It is an excellent game which should be played.
I don't know where to start with this game. I'm going to be 100% honest throughout this review. This game has absolutely the most compelling characters and story. I have put over 100 hours into this game. You play as Arthur Morgan, an outlaw from 1899. Arthur is a part of the Van Der Linde gang of outlaws, leaded by Dutch Van Der Linde. The game is too detailed for a review, so I'll just go over the reason why you are here. There is plenty of shootouts with visible blood, dismemberment of limbs, heads being blown off, explosions, etc. If your son/daughter has a strong moral compass, they will know not to go and blow somebody's head off with a shotgun. With sex, there isn't any and there is very mild references. In one of the missions, you have to save a girl from an abusive man that seems to have almost r*ped her. With swearing, there is the basic cowboy slangs like "bastard", "goddamn", "b***h", "c*****er", etc. Then there is infrequent use of "f**k", and "s**t. You get to decide if you want to go and shoot up a town or be an honorable cowboy. There is a system in the game that punishes you for commiting crimes or just being an asshole to other NPCs. As for drugs, there is cocane gum, alcohol, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarrettes, etc. The ending of the game varies if you were a good man or a bad man. As for drugs, there is cocane gum, alcohol, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarrettes, etc. *SPOILER ALERT* Arthur will die from tuberculosis looking over a mountain peacefully if the player was honorable. If the player decides to go back for the money instead of helping a friend escape, Arthur will die from being stabbed no matter if the player had high honor or low honor. The 3rd and final ending is that Arthur gets shot on the head if the player had low honor. This game has great messages and Arthur Morgan is a good man. It is up to the player to decide if they want to be a gritty outlaw or a honorable cowboy in Rockstar's newest open world game. You can free roam and interact with any NPC in a good way or bad. One of my favorite encounters is where you have to help a civil war veteran with one leg get his horse back after it ran away. After you return the horse, he invites you to go fishing. Little things like that make this game very unique and entertaining. If you have a mature 13 year old as your son/daughter, him/her and probably you, will enjoy this amazing western action.
To me, this video game should be played by teenagers over 14 years old at least. I don’t consider this game as a very violent game compared to other Rockstar game or compared to other wars game such as Call of Duty. Yes indeed, the use of gun will be really important, you will use it a lot of times to kill or advance in the game because you have to. But our character, Arthur Morgan, always kill for a good raison. We understand him, we know that he won’t kill people for any raison. Yes, of course, you will be able to hang people, to kill a passer-by, steal horses, kill the men on it, but all these things are here for you to have a better experience. I’m not sure that a kid will enjoy this, and do this on purpose, even if he does that, I don’t think he is able to understand what he did, so the impact will be low. Directly, the cover of the game tells you what you are expected to do. There is this cowboy pointing on your direction with his revolver in order to kill you. Here is a really quick sum up of the story. The story of the game talks about a gang searching for a safe place to hide out after a failed robbery, while gang moves from place to place, they successfully saved 9 families from death. During the story the gang will help others while also robbing and killing some people. However, the only reason though the gangs does this once again is to provide food for the people they saved. At the end of the story the main protagonist realizes that crime, no matter what, is bad, the ending shows redemption and why never to commit crime. Concerning the violent scene, there is some, but they are really few in on this 66-hour long game. There is shocked scene like the one where a member of our gang run into a house and kill a pregnant woman. Personally, only this scene shocked me, the presence of sex is almost absent, you will just see breast if you go to a brothel and concerning the injury you will hear F*ck a lot of times but that’s the language of the time. In conclusion, I find in this game that the place of the gun was minimize in comparison of others, yes gun have to be here for a realistic side but the use of it, it well done.
Let’s all be honest here, the rating says all these things about nudity and violence and language, well for one nudity is something I haven’t even seen on this game yet and I’m like 36 hours in. second, yea there’s language but I mean you really think a child 13 and over has never heard these words in school I mean come on it’s middle school and high school. Third, violence in this games is basically like watching and action or superhero movie, plus it’s a thing that happened in this world it’s not like this game over estimated the violence of the real world, some people say these games are a bad influence, but I mean it’s the Wild West and you may be a criminal in it, but you do heroic things.
I Recommended for mature teens it has many mature themes such as gore It can be quite Da gum bloody It really only Mentions sexuality although there is a hidden part where two people are doing the crazy thing. Brief nutidy nothing extreme
First let me preface this by saying that I am 16 years old and have been playing this game for roughly 17 hours. So far there has been nothing to warrant an 18+ rating. For nudity it’s literally just horse testicles that aren’t even noticeable half of the time. If your kid doesn’t know about genitalia at 16, something is wrong. In terms of sexual themes, the only other thing is that the saloon doubles as a brothel (which is historically accurate) but you never see any nudity or language describing the acts that go on there. The most you see is fully clothed women hanging out with fans. The next topic is drugs and alcohol. First off, whenever you go drinking in this game there are always negative consequences, the game doesn’t glorify drinking, as it often ends in getting into a bar fight or being captured by the law. Yes you can smoke to increase a power called deadeye in this game (it’s basically bullet time) but (spoiler alert) you end up with lung disease in the end. As for cocaine gum, it’s literally just regular chewing gum. Addressing the violence and gore in this game is tough, because depending on your honor (a meter in which there are negative consequences for doing illegal things) the chances that you run into it varies. Yes you can blow off limbs but it’s really rare as a certain set of criteria must be met to do so (shotgun at less than 3 feet) and those criteria are rarely met. Yes you do shoot people, usually criminals and people shooting at you as well, but with minimal blood. One thing I will say is that there is a quest line where you hunt a serial killer and find his headless victims, but nothing a 16 year old hast seen either in movies or tv shows. Also, the default view is third person although first person is available. On the topic of consumerism, big whoop you can buy upgrades, soooo scary that people are able to give into capitalist greed inside a video game! Get over it. The most important part of this game is that doing bad things leads to bad things happening to you, so don’t. Violence begets violence and so does hate, your actions have consequences and so you must consider their moral value constantly throughout the game. If that isn’t a positive message I don’t know what is. It actually has more positive role models than you might think. Multiple female cowboys and gunslingers, and, if you take the good route, you.
I think this game is a really cool. And if your kid can handle violence u should be just fine.
Pretty fun to play. I think the story is a bit off sometimes but the online mode is good.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to the original Rockstar title, and first off, it is one of the greatest and best-looking games of all time. The views are beautiful and undoubtedly breathtaking. But, enough about judging a game by its cover. Let’s get into the real story. I think that the story is very distinctive, unique, and engaging. It’s 1899, a time where outlaws are all but extinct. Except for the Van der Linde gang. You can ride your horse, you can use weapons' you can do anything a pn Outlaw from the Wild West would do during the time. They’re still out to survive against civilization. The protagonist, Arthur Morgan, is very very engaging, funny, and charming. He’ll keep you engaged at all times. The thing that I liked most about this game is that they let you be who you want to be. They let you choose the choices that the game allows you to choose. You can be good, or not. You can help people or not, you can kill innocents, or not. However there is an undoubtable humongous amount of violence and content that is not for children. The game is not afraid to show gore and blood, crushed skulls, broken limbs. It is not afraid to drop some major s-words, b-words, a few f-bombs and more. This is a game MEANT for mature players. But now let’s move on to the bad stuff. Oh, wait, THERE IS NONE!!! (Except maybe a couple of glitches popping up here and there). This masterpiece is the peak of the mountain that is called video game evolution. It is original, it is engaging, and it is breathtaking. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite video games of all time, and if you have a PC, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, I highly recommend buying this game. The $60 dollars are undoubtedly worth buying if you want an entertaining and enjoyable time.
This game is Breathtaking, it is gorgeous I recommend it to anyone with the mental maturity of at least a 12 year old. Some sexual references but very little. Plenty of violence and swearing, I’ve seen parents’ ideas about checking in on their honor level, DON’T DO THAT, if you are not ok with the fact that your kid has the possibility of doing something bad don’t get them the game, no kid wants to be micromanaged like that an it may damage your bond with your child.
Basically a pg-13 movie apart from the sexual stuff which only happened once for me I would say your kids should play it when the are able to watch pg-14 movies
