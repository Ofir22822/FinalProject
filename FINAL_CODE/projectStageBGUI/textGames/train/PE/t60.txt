WHAT!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!
It is the best! I love it. I watched and still watch this show, so the game is a dream come true. I really suggest it.
A great game for people 12 and up 90+ of amazing story characters and turn based combat
Great game!
Action anime game does not disappoint
I think they should change some of it
Great messages: Be yourself, be loyal, friendships are important, be brave in times of trouble, don't kill the bad guys if you can help it, be appropriate Great role models: The characters are all very different, all with touching backstories. While everyone has some sort of flaw, they still try their best to work past their differences to save their world. Ease of play: Gameplay is rather challenging, but once you find a good method, it's not particularly difficult. The plot is very involved, but because the game is only partially voiced, there is a lot of reading involved. Violence: A couple characters do die, though no deaths are explicit. When enemies are defeated, they disappear in a flash of light. The protagonists are very careful not to kill the villains, although they may have to point a gun at them to make sure they behave. There is no gore, and blood looks like spilled soda - a bit unrealistic. Some characters have very violent backgrounds, and violent images in black and white are shown sometimes when a character is speaking of their background. However, when speaking of their past, almost all the characters explain that without that hardship, they would not be the person they were that day. Characters use swords, magical staffs, lances, guns, bows, and they control giant robots. Sex: There are a few innuendos, and two main characters have a bit of a rough start because they find themselves in an awkward position. One female character does tend to flirt with the other female characters, but she is a minor character, and the other characters never respond to her words in a positive way. Female breast size is mentioned, but it is not an ongoing subject. The girls' school uniforms have slightly shorter skirts, but nothing can be seen. Swearing: Characters do use the word d**n when something does go terribly wrong, and a character was called a "pompous a**" twice. One villain uses s**t toward the end of the game. D**n is spread a bit throughout the game, but considering the game has approximately 120 parts in it that each take more than three hours to complete, it is infrequent. Like real people, some characters swear more than others, while some never swear in the entire game. For example, characters with kind dispositions tend to swear less than snarky characters or villains. Consumerism: there are many references to characters and events from past games, Trails in the Sky (they talk about Cassius Bright and the Bracer Guild) and Trails of Zero (they talk about the Special Support Section during the annexation of Crossbell). Drinking/drugs/smoking: There are references to drinking, as Class VII's homeroom teacher, Instructor Sara, does drink in her free time, but she never shows up drunk in the game, and even if she does and I just failed to notice, she acts the same, maybe just a bit exaggerated - hilarious, witty, and talented. Overall: Everything mentioned above may make the game sound a bit harsh, but in all honesty, the game would lose its touch without some of those parts. The protagonists all have good intentions, even if they make mistakes, like all humans do, making many of the characters very relatable. Some of the dialogue is absolutely hysterical, and the voice acting is really done well, and it makes up for the slightly choppy animations. It makes the characters come alive. It seems a lot more like an animated tv show or movie than a videogame at points, because there will be thirty straight minutes of dialogue. It's a good game for teens who love adventure, friendship, and strategy. Plot that may contain spoilers: the students of Thors Military work together to try and prevent a civil war. The game ends at a cliffhanger and must be continued in Trails of Cold Steel II.
Light profanity is contained but minor. Violence is not too bad but includes mild animated blood. Sexuality is mild as they discuss female breast size.
You can only play it when you do homework
Common sense
This game isn't as bad as many think
great game
JEEZ
11+
If you think this is a bad game I can understand why and also if your kids are having nightmares about this game they should learn to grow up and get tuff. Overall it’s a fun game and I would definitely recommend this game it’s one of the funnest games I have ever played if you want to lear more about this game there is a YouTuber named Igp he gives a run down of the game and has a walkthrough and he will cuss but the game will not. Attack me if you want parents I’m indestructible and you know it
This game isn't as bad as everybody thinks it shouldn't be rated T it should be rated E+10. The robots are a little creepy and you see a few dead bodies along the way, but it really isn't that bad there is no blood and it does have a good deal of violence. I have personally played this game and it is very fun but there are a lot of guns and there will be times where you fight the roots but other than that its a puzzle game deep down. There are a few glitches and there are some irritating moment and some people might find the robots scary but its overall a good game
its super good
It’s fine. Barely any violence. My parents didn’t let me play first person shooters until I was 14 but I think my little brother could play this. He watches all the time. My mom is fine with it. 10+. No gore or sex. Hasn’t cussed.
Some repetitive violence but not like some zombie game and no blood
Best game of all time
I was 10 when I first played this game and it was amazing. Even though the graphics are a little outdated these days, it doesn’t matter and fir me makes the game more nostalgic and comforting. Although my favourite video game, when I was 10/11 certain game mechanics (Materia setups/uses) We’re hard to fully understand but I was able to still play the game and it was fun. The violence isn’t really violence, it’s like what you would see in a tv show, although in some sections of the game there are trails of blood plus all the enemies you fight are monsters. There is minor profanity including words like damn, piss, hell, and some uses of censored words. There are a few suggestive sexual themes in parts of the game and Tifa possesses large breasts (no clear cleavage.) There are also some intense or sad scenes which I will not spoil. In total, this game is my favourite, has a great story, great gameplay and offers hours and hours and hours of gameplay because of the the games many secrets and side quests. Would highly recommend if you are running out of games to play or you just want a good video game. (Keep in mind it might be hard to find original ps1 copies nowadays.) Hope this helped.
they can hit people in the leg with balls
screw it buy it
Fantastic! But be aware of certain things
Fajna Gra
Hard, Gory and Scary
You will go insane
A masterpiece worth the perseverance
One of the best games I've ever played.
Content Wise, totally appropriate, but the difficulty makes it not great for younger kids.
It’s Very Very hard and it’s very violent.
Really fun at first, but soon becomes disappointing
Not a bad game
Interesting, fun, but very tough
Real talk
Another masterpiece by From Software.
This game has gore, good news you can turn it off, the gore isn't the issue, this is a from software game, they are brutally difficult to the untrained be aware your child, friend etc may get incredibly frustrated.
W?a?ciwie przemoc to jedyna rzecz kt?ra wp?yne?a na wiek. Nie ma tu nic z?ego opr?cz krwi tryskaj?cej na wszystkie strony ?wiata ale mi si? wydaje ?e tak +16 ta gra powinna by?.
the gameplay is REALLY hard but mostly fair as long as you offer your soul to HOURS of practice. there is a "posture meter" and when it fills up the enemy gets stunned and you can jump on them and stab them. its gory, and it takes out entire phases of bosses and is a 1-shot to any normal enemy to my knowledge. the only reason its 15+ is beacause the theme of enemies are centipides, which are in my opinion really gross and scary. skip the following list if you want to avoid enemy design spoilers: -centipides that """""hug""""" you -a boss's neck can become a centipide, a centipide-giraffe-monkey, if you will -(after you decapitate a giant) a centipide will sometimes come out of his neck but its slim and looks like a line from the distance. your main focus is not dying for the 10000th time on him because omg that guy is annoying -a centipide puking on you(never seen it myself, i took it out REALLY fast, got this one from Reddit) -a monkey with a centipide coming out of its neck and its really REALLY weird there are a lot more centipide enemies because in this game they are considered the symbol of immortality and the game sort of loves them, i dont FYI i didnt play 100% of the game myself because i had a friend play when things get way too centipide-y so i cant speak on 100% of the difficulty but what i have played tells me that this is the hardest FROM SOFTWARE game. if you hate centipides as much as i do this game isnt such a good time. if you want a ninja game that dosent focus so much on abominations with 1000 legs, or want something easier, OR want a story thats easier to understand i recommend "Ghost Of Tsushima" its coming out 17 July 2020 BUT it is a playstation 4 exclusive
Violence is the only thing that gives the game a mature rating, you kill enemies usually with your katana but there is also a variety of other weapons such as throwing stars, etc. There is an excessive blood spray when you stab an enemy but it quickly goes away, anyone 13 and older can handle it. The problem a lot of people have with the game is that it is insanely difficult. You fight overpowered bosses that can take hundreds of trys to beat and sometimes you'll get killed by simple enemies. If you have minor anger issues or are impatient then I would steer clear of the game and save your money. If you're a skilled player then I would say go for it because the game has good mechanics and you have to think to get by levels.
I thought this game was absolutely amazing, and worth the 60 dollars if you’re willing to persevere through tough boss fights. Gameplay wise it’s amazing, although it has a steep learning curb the combat is absolutely amazing and is focused on being close to your enemy and not letting them recuperate after you damage them, the deflection is simple but hard to lock down and you’ll eventually find other mechanics like the mikiri counter (a method of steeping on a thrusting enemy’s weapon to damage their posture) makes combat much more interesting and fluent throughout the game. The bosses are tough and you’ll have to throw yourself at them repeatedly in order to topple them. In terms of story the game is amazing, the main character, wolf, has been given divine blood by his master kuro and is now immortal (but for gameplay sake you can only come back once) he seeks to find his master and escort him out of the country of Ashina and he will kill anyone who gets in his way, but once wolf finds kuro, kuro refuses to leave because he wants to sever the immortal ties, and wolf agrees to help again eliminating all who get in his way, but the story isn’t about mindless murder it has a lot of themes that can be missed if you’re not looking for them. The game is about wolf’s guilt and regret about killing his enemies and how built up guilt leads to anger. It also deals with whether or not he should betray his father to serve Kuro, and how giving into anger and hate may be the easiest thing to do but it may not be the right thing to do as well as themes regarding how power can corrupt if abused a boss in the game, the corrupted monk, is called that because she has been corrupted by immortality. In terms of inappropriate content as you’ve seen from looking at the common sense review sex and language are entirely absent from the game, upon killing an enemy most of the time you’ll go for the neck and there will be a fountain of blood and the enemy will stagger and die however the gore is unrealistic and when it shows up on the ground and walls it’s just a black liquid bearing no resemblance to blood at all and there’s the refined sake which if you give to characters they will become intoxicated. Believe it or not this game has educational value because a lot of it has deep roots in Japanese culture, the centipedes that offer immortality in the game to your enemies were a symbol of impurity in feudal Japanese culture and the dragon that gives you immortality is a symbol of purity. Overall this game is a masterpiece that is worth playing if you’re willing to push through some challenge to get to the end than I would one hundred percent recommend it, however it is difficult so if you’re looking for something that you can sit back and experience with no challenge at all this is not the game for you.
I see people complaining about gore but you can turn off blood in the settings. I don't think it is worse than anything you would see in a pg13 movie. And the blood doesn't look very realistic so I really didn't find it that gory. However if you are disturbed by blood, stabbing etc, this may not be the best game.
First of all, this is a great game. The fighting mechanics are second to none, and the world is vast and beautiful. The variety of different types of bosses makes them never get old, and the game gives you a lot of freedom to explore because along with being able to run faster than a car on the highway, you have a grappling hook so you can travel from building with ease. Now, the difficulty is something that will turn a lot of people away. This game only has about a 20% completion rate, and most of those are very good players that knew that the game was going to be difficult. For younger players, their game mechanics and will to stay invested even when it gets hard. I did end up beating the game, but it took me 6 months and I died 542 times. That is nearly triple the amount of times I died from any other game. I’m just warning you that you or your kid need to know how difficult the game is before spend $60 on it. But overall, it is a fantastic game that 100% deserved GOTY.
It’s the hardest game I every played period. Also if your kid has violence issues the game is not for him/her. Even if you turn of blood the stabbing is still chilling.
I believe Sekiro a very mediocre game. It’s extremely fun and surprising at first, and can be very addicting. It’s also added new tweaks and ideas that are inspiring and don’t pop up in other games. You also have a lot of freedom to do what you want and try different things, and this always makes a game good. There is also a ton of stuff to explore and discover, with a lot of hidden mechanics and secret bosses. But I want to say like all other games developed by FromSoftware, the makers of Sekiro, that this game is extremely challenging. It is very unforgiving and merciless and can quickly frustrate many people like me. But I do also want to point out that this game is not very fun after you play it for a couple hours. Unless you traverse the main story, the game isn’t really fun. Don’t get me wrong though, I absolutely loved playing Sekiro, but unless you’re fighting the bosses and mini bosses, the game is very empty. Mostly, the game is chucked with a bunch of enemies structured all over the place, and how Sekiro really plays out is like going through stages. There are enemies all over a stage, until you finally reach the end where there is usually a boss or mini boss. Also, if you have played Dark Souls (another game by FromSoftware), some elements will feel very similar. However, I want to say the game is not very bad and is okay for normal kids and teenagers. Violence is the main thing in this game, but nothing is too cruel in this game. For most of the game you will be attacking enemies with a sword and if you stagger them enough, you will be able to perform a special move called a death blow. This allows you to stab the enemies through their stomach. However, this is not shown in a gory and bloody fashion. There are only some parts in the game that are a bit gross in my opinion. The first one requires you to chop off someone’s head. He soon comes back to life headless and then you will have to kill him by taking a centipede out of headless body. There are other parts where you kill them in a bloody, ninja fashion but it’s not extremely gross and painful. There is also not a lot of torture throughout the game. Blood is also in this game, but there is a setting where you can turn the blood completely off. The stabbing and attacking is shown, but no blood comes when you kill an enemy. Besides that, there is nothing else wrong or inappropriate with Sekiro and I highly recommend kids to get it.But if you’re looking for a easy game that’s not challenging, then I suggest NOT to play this game. I know I didn’t enjoy this game much, but I know a lot of others will. This game is crazy interesting at certain points in the game and is very amazing in how it handles things.
This is an amazing game and is super fun and challenging if your child has ever played a 16+ like assassins creed they will be totally fine there is some blood but the game is awesome if your kid has seen the Hobbit or something like it It will be fine. There is a lot of blood but there was a lot of blood in Avengers Endgame the main character is not evil he is killing evil. In Endgame many heroes killed people so whats the difference.
This game is really interesting and a very good addition to the Soulsborne franchise! Tough as usual but still amazing! Just make sure you're ready to die in this game A LOT
Let’s be real here, if your in the market for a masterpiece like sekiro then you will have played at least a 16+ and if you can handle that you can handle this. Common sense themselves only gave it a 16+ and they’ always super harsh!
This game follows a similar format to dark souls and bloodborne like what From software usually does. This game, however, does not have an online mode. With the absence of online, it allows you to use a variety of different moves, and techniques that you were never able to do in the previous games. This game does get violent, but it's not really a big deal. Sekiro is a very challenging game that will test your patience and frustration. You will end u fighting the same enemies multiple times having to come up with different strategies and tactics to beat them. Younger kids will probably rage quit, but if you think your kids can handle it then go ahead and get the game. Overall there is nothing to worry about. If your kid has ever played an M game, then they should be good.
