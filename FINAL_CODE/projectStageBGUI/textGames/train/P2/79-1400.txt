Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS
Our strive to keep you entertained during these times of isolation continues and this time have a mixed bag of games for you. We haven’t picked them at random, however. All of the titles we’ll present to you today have graphics that are far above the average for mobile games and offer eye-pleasing effects on top of that. 
Of course, these games aren’t just eye candy, they also offer immersive environments and engaging gameplay. Excited to see what’s coming next? Let’s get right to it, then!

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS
Yes, we know what you're thinking: "Is that even a game?" And technically, it is. Sure, not a long one, but there is some gameplay involved. Mostly, it's meant to highlight what visuals can be achieved on smartphones today but since we're talking about high-graphics games, we decided to throw it in the mix. This is a first-person shooter and the graphics and effects are truly impressive. It won't keep you busy for long, but if you want to see how your phone will handle heavy 3D games, TauCeti is definitely a good choice to make your device sweat. As the name suggests, there are also a couple of benchmarks you can run as well.

Call of Duty: Mobile

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS
Do we even need to describe Call of Duty? It’s the most popular first-person franchise in the world and as soon as the game was released for mobile devices, it was a success. The realistic graphics are a big part of it, but credit must be given to the game’s features as well. Multiple game modes to choose from, each with a unique twist on the familiar gameplay. From weapons and loadouts you can customize to unlocking achievements, there’s plenty to like about Call of Duty: Mobile. If you haven’t joined the millions of players already, now’s the best time to do so!

Asphalt 9: Legends

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

Asphalt 9 is another super-popular game and with good reason. The graphics are so good you start wondering how smartphones can be so powerful these days. Sure, the actual driving is far from realistic, your car spends more time flipping through the air than actually using its tires and the steering is pretty much automatic, but it’s all in the name of entertainment. And this game delivers on that front as well. Exoctic hyper cars, detailed maps, challenging opponents, it has it all.

Endless Nightmare

If you're the type of person that likes to be scared and enjoys watching horror movies, Endless Nightmare is here to provide some creepiness to your day. You have to explore your own home to find out the truth about the horrible event that transpired in it. The game's graphics will help you immerse yourself in the spooky environment and hopefully contribute towards better scares throughout your adventure. That's what it's all about, right?


The Gardens Between

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS
Puzzle games aren't usually known for their amazing graphics but The Gardens Between is an exception. The level design of this game is exceptional and just a joy to look at. The puzzles themselves are quite clever as well, so you'll enjoy the challenge while also enjoying the visuals. It should be noted that the game costs $4.99 on both Android and iOS, but at least that way you know your gameplay won't be interrupted by ads every two minutes and you can focus on solving the puzzles.

Mindcell

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

Mindcell is a not a very popular game but it deserves to be on this list. In this futuristic third-person shooter, you have to fight your way to your freedom, otherwise you'll become an experimental test subject and that's something that doesn't promise a good outcome. The levels you'll go through are diverse and detailed, pretty close to those of a console title. You'll encounter a wide range of enemies and bosses while looking for your escape, so be prepared for some high-paced action. The game costs $1 on iOS and $5 on Android, which might stop someone from trying it out, but if you're eager to experience something new, go for it!

ARK: Survival Evolved

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

ARK is a game with an amazing open world where dinosaurs roam free and you begin your journey scraping for food and clothes, trying your best to stay alive. As you become more experienced, however, you’ll find yourself the master of these same dinosaurs and owner of a base you’ve designed and built yourself. You don’t have to do everything alone, however, you can always find likeminded people and join a tribe. Together, you can go on adventures in the beautifully crafted environment, where plenty of secrets are waiting to be discovered.

The First Tree

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

The First Tree is a very unique game. It's all about relaxation and enjoyment. There are no enemies to fight, no ways to die and nothing that can scare or upset you. It's basically a fairy tale you get to participate in. As a fox. But you can also look at it as a form of interactive meditation, as the levels are so calming and pleasing to look at, you'll feel the stress of the day draining away from you as you play. It's a paid game, costing $5 on both platforms, but if you're appreciative of games as a form of art, The First Tree will be a valuable addition to your collection. 

Iron Blade: Medieval Legends RPG

Download from Apple App Store

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

Iron Blade is a classic RPG. Your character is covered in armor head to toe and is swinging around the biggest and baddest weapons he can get his hands on, leaving countless monsters dead in the process. And while many games of that type exist for smartphones, few of them look as good as Iron Blade. The levels are vast and the change between different environments keeps the gameplay from feeling boring. As you level up, you’ll learn new skills and gain access to more powerful weapons, which you’ll need to defeat the bosses.

The game also has a PvP element where you’re in charge of your own castle and have to defend it from the invasion forces of other players. It’s not all hacking and slashing in Iron Blade!

Black Desert Mobile

Top 10 games with BEST graphics for Android and iOS

Last but not least, we have an MMORPG for you. Black Desert has amzing graphics with a huge emphasis on spectacular skill effects which makes battles look epic even if there’s only a handful of enemies involved. You can choose between five classes, each with a unique fighting style and skillset. You’ll have to work hard to gain the experience needed to unlock the most powerful skills and acquire quality gear since you start with almost nothing. With plenty of other players roaming around the world, you can make new friends or just partner up to complete a quest or two faster. Black Desert suffers from some of the negatives of free games, but overall, it offers plenty fo enjoy as well. It’s definitely worth a try!

Solve Puzzles in Solitude
Ravenhill: Hidden Mystery
In Ravenhill, you need to find hidden objects in pictures, kind of like those bizarre I-Spy books from when you were a kid. Come for the immersive storyline, satisfying sounds, lovely graphics, and fun minigames. Stay because of the rewarding gameplay. There are tons of free boosters and monthly events that make any in-game purchases unnecessary. I've played this game every day since October 2019, and I have yet to get sick of it. If it's a bit too easy for you, the same developer makes a tougher version called Seeker's Notes. (Yes, I play that one, too.)

A Game Where You Stay in Bed
#SelfCare
This game is all about staying in bed. There's no way to win, no clear objectives, and no timers or countdowns. #SelfCare encourages you to be gentle with yourself and mindful of your own mental state. Sweet reminders (there's no rush) and bits of encouragement (the storm will pass) will leave you feeling peaceful after each session. Added bonus? Your laundry sorts itself with just a few taps. MyOasis (Android, iOS) is a similar game with a less overtly feminine design.

Play Your Cards Right
Hearthstone
This is a controversial pick, given Blizzard's less-than-stellar history as a company. Still, if you're looking to sling cards à la Magic the Gathering but prefer to sling them in the Warcraft universe, Hearthstone is what you want. The game is easy to learn and tough to master. Weekly tavern brawls and solo game modes keep things feeling fresh. Fans of card games (or The Witcher) might also like Gwent.

Florence
Florence isn't your typical game. It's from the designers of Monument Valley, another one of our favorites, and it's all about falling in—and out of—love. The narrative-driven game will only take you a couple of hours, but we're betting it'll be on your mind for much longer than that. We don't want to get too detailed, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but trust us when we say this one is worth your time. When you're done, if you're on iPhone or iPad, check out Journey. It's another incredible title published by Annapurna Interactive.

A Fixable Pandemic
Pandemic: The Board Game
This might feel a little too timely, but we're still fans of Pandemic, which scales the much-loved board game down to a smartphone-sized package. You can play alone or pass your smartphone around with two to four people for multiplayer action (just wash your hands after). It's your goal to find cures for the new global pandemic. If that sounds interesting, you might also like Plague Inc., where your objective is pretty much the opposite. Just make sure not to use it to model the spread of the coronavirus.

AdVenture Capitalist
Idle games are a blast, because they don't require a ton of critical thinking or hard work. AdVenture Capitalist is as easy as it is fun, and you can play it passively. Start with a single lemonade stand and work your way up to owning decillions of shrimp boats, all with just several taps. If capitalism isn't your thing, you might want to check out AdVenture Communist (Android, iOS) instead. It has a similar play style, and both games have tongue-in-cheek humor that'll make you chuckle. For an idle game with similar mechanics in a completely different package, I quite like Realm Grinder (Android, iOS).

Call on Me
Mystic Messenger
There's immersion, and then there's Mystic Messenger, an otome game where the characters chat, text, call, and email you. Over the course of 12 days, you'll face plenty of romance, intrigue, and mystery. The multilayered story has multiple branches and endings as well. If you're anything like the WIRED staff who've played it, you'll find yourself thinking about the characters long after the game is over.

80 Days
It's an oldie but it's a goodie. If you haven't played 80 Days, now's the perfect time to do so. This strategy game gives you the quest to race around the world in 80 days or less. You'll need to balance your health and finances, keep an eye on the time, and ensure that you don't fall too far behind. The story is vast, and things will be a little different every time you play. There aren't any in-app purchases either, which is quite refreshing.

Fast Asleep
Loóna
I tried this app after I saw it on Instagram, and now I can't live without it. Loóna uses science to help you fall asleep. It features guided meditation, coloring, peaceful music, and relaxing sounds, parceled out over 20-minute "Sleepscapes" that help get you in the right mindset to doze off. Blame it on "corona brain", but I've been having a really tough time getting to bed, or focusing on anything at all. Loóna has put a stop to my insomnia-fueled doomscrolling. If you are struggling to fall asleep, I can't recommend this highly enough. Wear headphones while using the app for the best experience.

Legends of Runeterra
Unlike most card games, Legends of Runeterra relies heavily on skill and not so much on luck. I started playing it after we included Hearthstone on this list, and while I still think Hearthstone has its merits, I kind of stopped playing since discovering LoR. It's easy to learn, tough to master, and every update is thoughtful, balanced, and leaves the game better than it was before—which is a rare find when it comes to trading card games. Every card features gorgeous artwork and interwoven stories that rely on the lore of the League of Legends universe. Inspecting the cards is a great way to pass the time while you're waiting for your opponent to make their next move.

Death Squared
Imagine if Portal was isometric, starred adorable cubes, and lacked the titular portals, and you have Death Squared—seriously, the game even has a snarky narrator who endearingly gives you guff as you fail and succeed in levels. It's a charming puzzle game that's not afraid to make tickling your brain a cute, funny endeavor.

The physics ensure that navigating simple stages is never as straightforward as it seems. If you play on PC, you can build your own levels and play other players' creations, too.

Inversus Deluxe
Indie games don't get much more frenetic and fun than this one. Your job is to try and take control of a checkerboard by playing as a moving tile that shoots other tiles. It's super simple, but like the skill ceiling is really high. You can play with up to four people locally and fight each other in two-person teams, or cooperatively tackle the game's insane arcade mode (two players only). It supports all of these co-op modes online, too.

Unravel Two is a side-scrolling platformer starring two tiny sentient yarn creatures who must traverse the large, scary world we humans live in. The two yarnys, as they're called, depend on each others' stringy bodies to perform various acrobatic feats and avoid obstacles, such as animals and nature hazards. While it sometimes struggles to make its puzzles and challenges intuitive, the game's gorgeous graphics and heartfelt two-player design make up for any shortcomings.

It also encourages trading items mid-race with allies and using their speed to increase your own, meaning an eagerness to help squadmates is mandatory to score first place.

If The Shawshank Redemption had a video game adaptation, this would be it.

This game's an action-adventure like no other, loaded with heists, big-budget set-pieces, unique co-op mechanics, and enough narrative heft to satisfy just about every kind of gaming duo who've ever wanted to try their hand at escaping jail from the comfort of a couch. Plus, A Way Out offers online co-op even if only one of you owns the game!

Portal 2
Use your portal gun to shoot portals in two places so you can walk into one and come out the other. That's what the original Portal first-person puzzle game was all about. Now, multiply that portal count by two and you'll begin to imagine the mind-bending fun of Portal 2, which has a cooperative campaign that requires a pair of players to figure out how to make four portals transport them through some seriously tricky puzzle rooms. If you like physics, teamwork, and funny characters, this is a fantastic, one-of-a-kind puzzler to blaze through with a friend.

Mekazoo
Every stage in Mekazoo can be completed solo, but the platformer's central gimmick of switching between robotic animals mid-level affords the game a unique co-op mechanic. One player controls the primary animal and a friend controls the secondary one. Only one animal can play at a time, so you both take turns as needed. Whoever is pressing buttons on their controller activates their animal until the other player presses a button (don't fight!). Extreme precision is required to avoid screwing each other over, but for friends who really want to test their platforming prowess as a team, no game can top this neon-drenched couch co-op insanity.

Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
This 2D shooter and spaceship management simulator lets up to four players save the galaxy from the forces of "anti-love" by controlling different facets of a single spaceship to pilot it through levels brimming with baddies. One player is the pilot, one controls the shields, and the other two control the four guns. The only way to survive is through intense coordination. Thankfully, since it's a couch co-op experience, shouting orders back and forth with your crew is an intergalactic piece of cake.

Resident Evil 6
In many ways, Resident Evil 6 is the pinnacle of cinematic action-adventure horror games. It blends its genres with skill and, at times, even manages to sell the idea that you're trapped in a wildly fun B-movie. That fun is doubled when you bring a friend along for the ride, since the game offers two-player co-op for all four of its lengthy campaigns. Few cinematic gaming experiences offer the bang for the buck that RE6 provides, and even fewer can do it all in co-op like this one.
