The Best Black Friday Video Game and Accessory Deals 
We need to stay indoors and not travel for the rest of the year. Why not stockpile on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox titles?
A gaming console on sale.
ILLUSTRATION: SHANI PLEASANTS
WELL BEFORE BLACK Friday, there were tons of gaming deals swirling around the internet, like dust kicked up by the release of two new consoles: the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Now that the newest iterations are out, previous-gen games are seeing discounts all over the place.

It's good timing with the holiday season upon us, but Covid-19 is still raging around the country, and most of us can't see family. Video games provide a great way to connect with loved ones at a safe distance. We hope our favorite Black Friday video game and accessory deals will help in these trying times.

Note: We strike through items that sell out or are no longer at their deal price as of publishing. Discounts sometimes return, so check for yourself. We will update this guide throughout the weekend.

Special offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com and our print magazine (if you'd like). Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.

Updated November 27: We've checked all links and prices.

Nintendo Switch Deals

Nintendo's at-home and on-the-go console has been a popular little guy ever since it first came out in 2017, and it's only gotten better over time. With a robust library of AAA and indie games to choose from, the Switch is my favorite couch-side companion for these dark winter months. See our Best Switch Accessories and Best Switch Games guides for more picks.

Nintendo Switch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle for $300 ($68 off) at Target, Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop: The Nintendo Switch is a killer console, and even though this isn't a price reduction, you're getting Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and three months of Switch Online included for free—that's a savings of $68. It's a great way to test the waters and see if you want to bother with a subscription to play online. This deal is going in and out of stock frequently, so check back to see if it's available.

Hades for $20 ($5 off): Explore a dark (and let's be real, pretty sexy) take on the Greek underworld in this lavishly detailed roguelike for Switch. WIRED gear writer Louryn Strampe sang praises in her review, which you can read here.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses Digital Edition for $40 ($20 off): Even if you're not a Fire Emblem die-hard, this game of wartime strategy and teenage interpersonal drama is a potent concoction.

Luigi's Mansion 3 for $40 ($20 off): The season for scares has passed, but Luigi's Mansion 3 is still a great buy for anyone looking for low-key spooky vibes this winter season. Or anyone really into slime people.

Cuphead for $15 ($5 off): You may get frustrated with this game because it's hard. But it's hand-drawn and looks absolutely gorgeous, making it well worth the time and effort. Play it co-op with your quarantine bubble.

Hollow Knight for $8 ($8 off): This game casts you as a bug-person with a nail for a sword. Explore Hallownest, a fallen civilization filled with monstrous enemies and friendly faces that need your help. This deal is also available at GameStop.

RavPower 26,800-mAh 30W PD Power Bank for $47 ($12 off): Is your Switch often running out of juice when it's out of the dock? This power bank is powerful enough to recharge it while you play, so you don't have to take a break. It was $2 cheaper earlier, but it's still a good deal.

Whether you have a PS4 or PS5, there are tons of killer games on sale for both consoles.

Sony PlayStation 5 for $399+: This is not a deal, but it's a popular new console. It's near impossible to find in stock though. Read our review for our impressions on Sony's latest, and if you're shopping for a new PlayStation, we don't recommend buying the older PS4 Pro. The discounts aren't steep enough; you may as well save up for the newer models as they'll last much longer. There are two PS5 models available—one with a disc drive and one that can only play digital games. We think it's worth shelling out for the former.

The Last of Us Part II for $30 ($30 off): One thing Sony has always had in its corner is a deep reservoir of exclusive titles like The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us II. While this game is certainly divisive, it's gorgeous and lavishly detailed, if super violent and occasionally hard to watch.

Ghost of Tsushima for $40 ($20 off) : The best way to while away the hours during this pandemic is with a good old-fashioned open-world game you can sink into. Ghost of Tsushima takes you through the first Mongol invasion of Japan and puts you in the shoes of an intrepid (if a bit anachronistic) samurai on a quest to save Japan.

Until Dawn for $10 ($10 off) : It's hardly a new game, but it's one of my favorites, and I will sing its praises for the rest of the foreseeable future. Until Dawn is a campy horror movie choose-your-own-adventure that follows the exploits of a group of teens stranded at an icy mountain chalet who find themselves being hunted by a mysterious killer. What's not to like?

Death Stranding for $20 ($20 off) : Hideo Kojima is a weird dude. Death Stranding, the 2019 title from the acclaimed director, is a weird game. But it's fascinating and hard to put down once you start. You play as Sam, a deliveryman in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by angry, hungry ghost-monsters. Most of your time will be spent figuring out clever ways through difficult terrain, and it's absolutely enthralling.

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice for $25 ($35 off): From Software's games are not often for the faint of heart, and Sekiro is more punishing than most. But it is an undeniably beautiful, tense, and well-crafted game. If you're looking for a challenge (and you're not daunted by the difficulty of games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls), it's a great pick.

The Outer Worlds for $24 ($36 off): This sci-fi role-player is a laborious game chock-full of side quests. That may or may not be a good thing depending on the player. But it's witty, with an excellent (anti-capitalist) narrative design. Read our review for more.

HyperX Cloud Alpha S Headset for $100 ($30 off) : This is an all-around solid gaming headset. It boasts 7.1 surround sound as well as an audio control mixer for blending the sound of your mic with the game audio to your exact liking. It works with PC and PS4.

The new Xbox Series X boasts powerful hardware to make the most of next-gen games and improve the performance and graphics of select previous-gen games, many of which are on sale this Black Friday.

Microsoft Xbox Series X and Series S for $300+: This is not a deal, but like the PlayStation 5, it's a popular purchase this holiday season. It's similarly tough to find. Our review has all the details about this console if you want to learn more. It's tough to find the previous Xbox One X at a worthwhile price, so we recommend sticking to the newer versions, which will last for years to come.

3 Months of Xbox Game Pass for $23 ($22 off): The best reason to get an Xbox Series X or Xbox One X is for Game Pass. This membership service gives you access to over 300 games, plus an ever-changing roster of new and old games. It's nearly impossible to run out of games to play.

Xbox Wireless Controller for $39 ($26 off): This deal shows up in-cart. It may also be available at Amazon. Some colors have the sale price, others don't. It's compatible with Xbox One X, Xbox One S, Xbox One, and Windows 10.

Doom Eternal for $20 ($40 off): Who hasn't wanted to rip and tear their way through demonic legions in literal hell while clad in super-powered space armor? Well, now you can, in the follow-up to the wildly successful Doom reboot. It's just as satisfying as the original, but it is admittedly a more-of-the-same situation. Thankfully, the gameplay served up in the first game is strong enough to hold up a sequel.

Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order for $25 ($10 off) : We're not getting a new Star Wars movie this holiday season (at least we have Baby Yoda), but you can still get your fix by taking on the role of a Jedi padawan as he searches the galaxy for the remnants of an ancient civilization. Also, lightsaber fights. You get to do a lot of lightsaber fights.

Marvel's Avengers for $25 ($35 off) : We're not getting a new Avengers movie this holiday season either, but Marvel's Avengers is an OK stand-in. Seriously, it's just OK. But at this price, it might be worth diving into if you want to smash things with Thor's hammer.

Sunset Overdrive for $5 ($15 off): You get an excellent movement system and creative combat options in this game from the makers of Marvel's Spider-Man. Sunset City is an open world you can traverse through, and you'll have a blast doing just that.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $26 ($14 off): Never played a Halo game before? Now's the time to dive into this remastered set that includes six titles, from the first Combat Evolved to Halo Reach.

Game consoles and gaming PCs are only part of the hardware equation; the right accessories can turn an everyday gaming experience into an immersive and cinematic adventure. Check out our Gamepad, Headset, and PS4 Accessory roundups for more suggestions.

Aukey KM-G12 Keyboard for $49 ($20 off): This is a great budget gaming keyboard, and we've never seen it this cheap before. It’s hard to find a good mechanical keyboard this loud and precise for under $100, let alone under $50. Note that Amazon will apply an additional discount at checkout, so what you see on the product page is not the final price.

Samsung 1-TB 860 EVO 2.5-Inch SATA III SSD for $100 ($100 off): Samsung drives are generally fast and reliable, and this price is the best we’ve seen all year. The deal is matched at Best Buy and B&H.

Western Digital Easystore 5-TB External Hard Drive for $90 ($40 off): This price matches the best deal we've seen on this hard drive all year. External drives are especially nice to have on hand if you need to free up space in your Xbox or PlayStation. You'll need to log into your Best Buy account to see this member pricing (it's free to join if you don't have an account).

Samsung Pro Endurance 128-GB MicroSD Card for $20 ($20 off): These fast, durable cards will work anywhere you’d normally use them, including in the Nintendo Switch. The Pro Endurance series is specifically designed for video monitoring. They’re an especially good option for dash cameras or indoor security cameras. This deal is matched at Best Buy.

Razer Viper for $100 ($50 off): This is the Best Gaming Mouse. If you're shopping specifically for a gaming rig and a trackpad isn't going to cut it, we highly recommend the Viper. It's fast, the battery life is impressive, and it feels natural in the hand. This deal is matched at Best Buy.

Roccat Kain 120 AIMO for $30 ($40 off): This is one of the best gaming mice, especially if you want a tactile experience each time you click. There are four buttons, a clickable scroll wheel, and DPI adjustment options. This is the best price we’ve seen for it.

Razer Kraken Ultimate Headset for $70 ($60 off): Straightforward with a wired, over-ear design that's best for long sessions, the Razer Kraken headset is a classic. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles you'd get from a newer (and more expensive) headset, but it's a solid all-around pick for anyone looking to do some online gaming. It works with PCs too.

The Sims 4 for $5 ($35 off) + DLC Deals: This game is great, but the add-ons can get expensive quickly. Almost every extra pack is on sale and the base game is just $5. Read our guide to the Best Sims 4 Add-Ons if you don't know which to get.

World War Z
World War Z takes the smart, fast, anthill-forming zombies of the Brad Pitt movie and throws them into the anthology-style, globe-trotting format of the original book. That lets it showcase a lot of different regions and cultures through the lens of a particularly devastating zombie apocalypse. The game is somewhat light on content, but there are enough difficulty levels, character classes, and unlockables to keep the four-player cooperative undead-hunting fresh and lively for a good while.

Absolver
Absolver is a meditative martial arts experience that teaches you to make friends through fisticuffs. You can team up with one or two pals to conquer the game's small open world and bonus dungeons, all of which encourage teamwork. And if you don't have friends to play with, you can meet other players in the open world and try to initiate spontaneous friendships through simple in-game hand gestures. Absolver is about communicating as much as it is fighting, and that makes it a cooperative adventure-brawler like no other.

A Way Out doesn't radically alter the fundamentals of the cooperative action-adventure scene. But what separates this game from its peers is that you see what the other person is doing at all times, thanks to a clever camera system that keeps tabs on both players in a range of inventive, cinematic ways. It also often requires both players to work in tandem.
If you don't have a buddy who owns the game, good news: A friend can download and play for free with you if you already own it.

Syndicate
If there's one genre that suffers from too few co-op games, it's cyberpunk sci-fi. Thankfully, 2012's Syndicate fills that void with an incredible four-player co-op experience. It's a first-person shooter that has some of the most satisfying, weighty gunplay in a shooter ever, and features sci-fi hacking abilities similar to those of certain recent AAA games. It's an oldie but a goodie, and a must-play for anyone in need of cooperative cyberpunk fun.

Assassin's Creed: Unity
Technical issues tainted its launch, but Assassin's Creed: Unity has risen from the ashes as one of the most visually ambitious and fun co-op experiences on the market. Up to four players can team up and parkour around the streets of late 1700s Paris together, completing missions ranging from escorting Napoleon to killing Austrian spies. It's great fun for fans of stealth and action games, and Unity's drop-dead gorgeous recreation of Paris makes it a must-play for gamers who want to time-travel back to the French Revolution.

Up to four players cooperatively gun down enemies, use superpowers, and parkour around a wide variety of exotic, interstellar maps, all in a quest to accrue more "stuff." It's easy to get lost in the game's hypnotic, grindy rhythm for hundreds of hours at a time, thanks to its well-executed mechanics and gameplay.

Styx: Shards of Darkness
In Styx, you and a friend are put in the shoes of two mischievous, crass goblin assassins who must maneuver through a violent, twisted empire to steal trinkets and survive. The game employs all the usual stealth-genre tropes, including hiding enemies' dead bodies, staying in the shadows to be invisible, and dangling from precarious precipices to avoid detection. But its classical approach to the genre is a plus, making it that much easier to learn the ropes of the game and enjoy its old-school simplicity and difficulty as a team.

Apex Legends
Apex Legends tasks 60 players with squadding up in teams of three to fight to the death inside one big, busy map. There are items to loot, opponents to shoot, and constantly shrinking map boundaries to outrun, and Apex Legends manages all these obligatory battle royale inclusions quite well. Unique skills for each character and the ability to revive teammates both make this game a touch deeper and more engaging than most of its genre competitors, like Fortnite.

Dying Light
Up to four players can explore Dying Light's fictional city of Harran together, mowing down zombies. Unlike most zombie games, it doesn't emphasize shuffling around on ground level with the living corpses—it encourages players to hop over enemies' heads, run across rooftops, and use Harran as a city-sized jungle gym. Swords, guns, and grappling hooks are also present, so even if your friends want a vanilla zombie-slaying adventure instead of a crazy free-running jog across the heads of the undead, this co-op will probably fit the bill.

Dead Space 3
Dead Space 3 is a game about trudging through snow, building guns, and shooting creepy mutating undead monsters called necromorphs. The recipe is simple and satisfying. The game's co-op mode allows two players to go through these motions together as they work their way across an ice-entrenched planet filled with frights, and thanks to the online nature of the experience, at points players are separated and forced to entertain entirely different horrors simultaneously. For those in search of cooperative third-person shooters, it's definitely worth considering.
Note: The Xbox 360 version of this game will work on Xbox One.

Stardew Valley
Stardew Valley's online co-op doesn't add anything to the classic Harvest Moon formula besides extra players, but that single addition means everything. All the fun of farming, forming relationships with villagers, and engaging in good old-fashioned agrarian capitalism is doubled, tripled, and quadrupled with up to three other players present, since the game has you all share in the risks and rewards of each other's actions. And as we all know, nothing helps plant the seeds of friendship like farming together.

Portal 2
Just like the original Portal, Portal 2 is all about one thing: teleportation. You get two portals, one to let you in somewhere and another to spit you out somewhere else. Portal 2's co-op mode doubles this and enables two players to utilize four portals in order to conquer exceptionally tough puzzle rooms that necessitate an understanding of basic physics, momentum, and teamwork. Very few puzzle games feature a polished, narrative-driven co-op campaign like this one, so for thinking minds, Portal 2 is a great experience to share.

Sea of Thieves
Sea of Thieves is not a perfect game—not by any stretch of the word. The story feels both absent and convoluted, and for a game about the deep sea, it can feel shallow. Where it succeeds is in its core pirating gameplay. It's an absolute pleasure to get a crew of three to four people and man a ship together: one person steering, another on sails, another firing cannons, and another patching the boat (or bailing it out) when you encounter other ships full of players. It takes coordination, and there's a couple dozen hours of fun to be had goofing off on the high seas.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection (4 Games)
This collection of Halo games has been available on Xbox One for a while, and now it's on PC, too. If you want to relive the famous series' glory days or see what the hype was all about, this package makes it easy to inexpensively experience a half dozen Halo games.
The PC version has yet to receive all the games in the collection, but they'll be released throughout 2020. The Xbox One version has certain split-screen limitations, and the PC lacks split-screen altogether, so online is the best way to cooperatively play these games.

Mothergunship
If Doom Eternal isn't crazy enough for you, Mothergunship is the game to get. It's a first-person shooter that's every bit as metal as Doom, but funnier and with a lot more bullets flying around. It's so crazy, you can build custom guns that fire enough bullets in a single trigger pull to fill your entire screen and lag your game down (if that's what you want). And when you play with a friend in co-op, that hardware-tormenting insanity is doubled. This game rocks. Hard.

Darksiders Genesis
This is the fourth installment in the Darksiders franchise and continues its story about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It's a Diablo-esque dungeon crawler where you slash, shoot, jump, and ride cool horses. It's also the first game in the series that lets you play as Strife (the fourth horseman), so there's a built-in novelty to Genesis for series fans. And even for newcomers, there's something satisfying about blasting your way to big showdowns with scary, hellish bosses.

God's Trigger
God's Trigger is a top-down slasher-shooter starring a dapper angel and demon who must team up to fend off a lot of holy and demonic forces that are up to no good. The premise is simple, the presentation is stylish, and the gameplay is fast, furious, punishing, and addictive. There's a lot to love here. Be warned, though: The game is tough, so make sure you only enlist a co-op partner who's OK with dying repeatedly, and then dying again. Checkpoints are plentiful, but even so, this game is rough.

Overcooked 2
It may sound fun to run a cute restaurant with friends, but don't fool yourself. Overcooked is an experience that will make even the most seasoned gamers reassess their skills. But for those who like a challenge, Overcooked! 2 is a breath of fresh air in a market that's overstuffed with violent games.
Here's how it works: Orders come into the kitchen and every player must work together to create each of the ingredients, assemble them, and deliver the finished goods—all before the next order comes in. (Spoiler: It already has.) If you've ever had to hectically coordinate with someone in your real kitchen, this game perfectly recreates your frustrations and multiplies them—all in the name of fun!
