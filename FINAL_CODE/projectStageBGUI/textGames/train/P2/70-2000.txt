After that, there's the usual RPG element of completing missions and levelling up. But there's also a survival element in it. You have to gather resources and upgrade your base in order to successfully defend from enemies. To do that, you can partner up with other real players, where the MMO element of the game comes in. The graphics are also quite good so your whole experience will be in an environment that's nice to look at.

With the Eve: Online mobile game still in development, Second Galaxy is your best option for space exploration. Thousands of star systems at your fingertips, spaceships from tiny to enormous, battles like you’ve only seen in Star Wars movies, Second Galaxy has it all. Sure, enjoying the beauty of space is not the same when it’s done through your phone’s display, but having a game as expansive as this in your palms is still quite impressive. If you’re a Sci-Fi geek that’s run out of TV shows to watch, Second Galaxy is here to fill that void.

Tempest Pirate Action RPG

Price: $7.99 on iOS, Free on Android

Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
From the vastness of space, we’re going back to the vastness of Earth’s oceans. If battles with lasers and rockets are too chaotic for you, then you’d probably find the slow pace of seafaring more enjoyable. Choose your own pirating style: hire a crew, customize your ship and voyage the seas, completing missions and fighting mythical creatures in the process. Both ships and water look amazing and with such games, there’s little else that matters in terms of visuals. Steer the ship, aim the canons and plunder the bounty, all in a day’s work in Tempest Pirate Action RPG!

Genshin Impact

Price: Free
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS

Genshin Impact is one of the newest and most popular RPGs. The world is vast and the graphics are reminiscent of the style of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild, which is a compliment. The characters are diverse and enjoyable to play with, which gives the game a ton of value in terms of replayability. What's even best is you can play with your friends across different platforms and explore this amazing world together, fighting enemies like never before. If you're a fan of these types of games, you have to try Genshin Impact!

Oceanhorn

Price: $7.99 on iOS, Free on Android
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS

Oceanhorn is an older game but that doesn't mean it's not good enough to be on this list. And what's even better is that it's now free on Android. On iOS you still have to pay $8 for it, or you can enjoy the sequel, Oceanhorn 2 on Apple Arcade. The game has cheerful, cartoony graphics and offers a wide range of environments for you to explore and search for loot while killing an enemy here and there. It might not have the most awesome visual effects but it will do the trick when you need to kill some time and would rather not play something too heavy on the senses.

Six-Guns

Price: Free
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
Six-Guns is set in a far more realistic world: that of the wild west. The game adds a twist to it, however, pushing the guns to the extreme in terms of design and capabilities, all in the name of fun. You still get to explore the world on the back of your trusty horse but you can be equipped with anything from a steam-powered chainsaw to a flamethrower. Of course, to get the coolest ones you’ll need to put in the effort but that doesn’t mean you won’t have a good time. Six-Guns might not be Red Dead Redemption, but it’s as good as you get on mobile.

Goat Simulator

Price: Free
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
Goat Simulator took the world by storm with its sheer absurdity and we couldn’t have passed on it. It’s a game that takes nothing seriously, embraces bugs and provides hours of hilarious gameplay. As you might imagine, the game is as far from an actual simulation of a goat’s life as you can imagine, although goats do love to headbutt things and you’ll do a lot of in this game. If we have to describe Goat Simulator in one word, it’s “mayhem”, and the best type of it at that!

Wolf Tales

Price: Free
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
Don't want to play as a goat? How about a wolf instead? Unlike Goat Simulator, Wolf Tales takes roleplaying very seriously. You have to defend your territory, fight other wolves in PvP battles and even breed wolf pups to make your pack stronger. There are different types of wolves you can unlock, with their own skills and abilities. This game is no joke. If you're into wolves or wild animals in general, you'll have a blast playing Wolf Tales. There's more content in it than you thought there might be in a game like this. Which is always good news, so why not give it a try?

Stardew Valley

Price: $4.99
Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
The world of Stardew Valley might not be vast but it more than makes up with the things you can do in it. If you haven't heard of Stardew Valley, you might be sceptical at first, but if you decide to spend the $5 and give it a try, you won't be disappointed. The game is fun to play, relaxing and satisfying. The music and sound effects fit the style of the gameplay perfectly, making for a very enjoyable experience. You'll sink hours in it without even realizing it. It's also available on PC if you want to play it on a bigger screen and with a keyboard and a mouse, which makes things a lot easier.

Beyond the standard RPG elements, you also have some crafting to do, to make your in-game life easier.

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS

Sky: Children of Light is basically what you’ll get if Alto’s Odyssey became a 3D adventure game. The style is similar, with pastel, eye-pleasing colors and locations that make you feel like you’re in a dream. The world of Sky is full of wonders and secrets for you to uncover. Its chill atmosphere will make you feel more like meditating than gaming. The developers promise to keep expanding the game with new areas and events so if you decide to jump into it, there will be plenty to do now and in the future.

GTA: San Andreas

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS

You didn’t think we’ll talk about open-world games without mentioning GTA, did you? Sure, the graphics look dated even for a mobile game, but that’s still the San Andreas we love. The storyline is long and engaging but if you’re not one to follow a predetermined path, you’re free to do whatever you want in the three cities the map covers or the secretive areas tucked between them. Do we need to say more? It’s a GTA game, you know what to do!

Minecraft

15 best open world games with great graphics for Android and iOS
Last, but definitely not least, comes the global phenomenon Minecraft. We can end it at that, there’s hardly a person left that doesn’t know what Minecraft is all about. What’s more open-world than a world you can change into literally anything you want to? The gameplay Minecraft provides is not measured in hours, not even in days. People spend years playing this game and still enjoy it as much as they did on day one. If somehow you’ve never heard of it before, you’re in for quite a ride!

The Best Sci-Fi and Space Games on Mobile
By Robert Carnevale June 28, 2018

 
 
 
 
 
The Best Sci-Fi and Space Games on Mobile
Tales from the Borderlands

Telltale
While science-fiction-steeped games tend to fare best on consoles and PC, quite a few sci-fi games reach the mobile market as well. However, given the shovelware that clutters Apple's and Google's app stores, it might be hard to figure out what sci-fi games are worth your time.

Luckily, we've got a list for that. Showcasing 15 of the best sci-fi- and space-themed games across iOS and Android, this list offers a smorgasbord of genres, from arcade twin-stick shooters to classic RPGs and everything in between. If you want to fly spaceships or mow down aliens, get ready to find your next mobile-gaming addiction.

Xenowerk (iOS, Android)
Xenowerk (iOS, Android)

Pixelbite
For twin-stick-shooter fans, Xenowerk is definitely worth checking out. Featuring 70 levels filled to the brim with slimy mutants, spooky laboratory hallways and atmospheric dread, this sci-fi game is an interesting exercise in design. It emphasizes lighting dynamics, arming you with a flashlight and some zany firearms with which to fend off hordes of shadowed, jump-scare-ready monsters. It's a bold take on the twin-stick shooter genre, and Xenowerk is doubly ambitious for tackling such an endeavor as a mobile game. Check it out!

Sid Meier's Starships (iOS)
Sid Meier's Starships (iOS)

2K
Though it lacks the infinite replayability of its PC-exclusive big brothers, this Civilization spin-off covers many of the same core beats. It's more than serviceable for Civilization fans hoping to have some strategic fun while on the go. Using the basic Civilization mold of hexagonal, randomly generated mapping; turn-based, bureaucratic gameplay; and constant, tense negotiations with irrational AI, Starships includes most features that Civ fans have come to expect from the series. The only difference is that here, everything's space-themed and thoroughly condensed for mobile. While that leaves some of the series' best aspects on the chopping block, what's on display in Starships is more than enough for a good few hours of fun.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (iOS, Android)
Aspyr Media

Aspyr Media
If you've ever wanted an incredibly deep Star Wars Expanded Universe RPG experience on your phone, Knights of the Old Republic is for you. It delivers hands-off, old-school RPG difficulty and freedom, all wrapped up in a Star Wars package. You can be a squeaky clean Jedi or ruthless Sith, develop your own lightsaber, customize your abilities, and travel across vast stretches of the Star Wars galaxy. Though the game looks pretty ugly by today's gaming standards, if you can get past its dated surface, the content within is the stuff of gaming legends.

PinOut (iOS, Android)
PinOut (iOS, Android)

Mediocre
It's arcade-style pinball, with a whole lot more pizzazz and flair than you're used to. Riffing off the sci-fi aesthetic of Tron, PinOut features glowing, neon-drenched pinball tables that stretch on (seemingly) forever, and you can bounce balls around in these tables until the game's timer clocks you out. It's stylin', simple, old-school fun with a new-school look, and it's a great way to pass the time.

N.O.V.A. Legacy (iOS, Android)
N.O.V.A. Legacy (iOS, Android)

Gameloft
N.O.V.A. Legacy is a noble attempt at capturing the console FPS experience in a mobile environment. Featuring a Halo-esque space setting and plenty of colorful, armor-clad marines, Legacy is pretty honest about what it's putting on the table: some mindless, flashy, single-player FPS action to sate sci-fi fans during their commutes to work. However, the game also features a fully realized online multiplayer deathmatch mode, which is a great addition for more-dedicated gaming sessions.

Galaga Wars (iOS, Android)
Galaga Wars (iOS, Android)

Bandai Namco
It's Galaga with a fresh coat of 21st century paint, aka 2D, bullet-hell spaceship shooter action, featuring as many explosions and pew pews as you can handle. Colors are rich and vibrant, the space theme is well-adapted to modern-day graphical capabilities, and the game is an overall treat for the eyes. Couple that with this title's classic, endless shooting fun and new two-ship "twin" mode, and Galaga Wars is a great pick if you need a new go-to time-killer sci-fi game.

Galaxy on Fire 2 HD (iOS, Android)
Galaxy on Fire 2 HD (iOS, Android)

Deep Silver
Galaxy on Fire 2 HD has everything, barring a cool name. There's resource management, spaceship customization, sandbox and story-driven gameplay, high-octane spaceship dogfights, voice acting, a sweeping orchestral soundtrack, and more! If you want a fully fledged space-combat experience in the palm of your hands, GoF2HD will do the trick just fine. Be wary, though: The touch-screen controls take some serious getting used to and can be somewhat dodgy even for dedicated fans.

Dead Effect 2 (iOS, Android)
Dead Effect 2 (iOS, Android)

Badfly
For anyone wanting a mobile clone of Dead Space, Dead Effect 2 has you covered. While it riffs heavily off Dead Space in its isolating, claustrophobic station setting that's infested with zombie-like monsters, DE2's heavy-handed borrowing from that franchise's mold works in DE2's favor. It's the only mobile game to deliver an action-horror experience quite this well. This title offers a lengthy campaign and quite a few RPG elements, so if you want lots of playability and replayability from a thinly veiled mobile ode to Dead Space, Dead Effect 2 makes a compelling case for a place on your phone.

XCOM: Enemy Within (iOS, Android)
2K

2K
If you're a sci-fi junkie who likes your aliens deadly and diametrically opposed to your species' survival, this is the game for you. Featuring an international team of elite soldiers; a wide variety of lethal aliens; and tons of cool guns, gadgets and powers, XCOM is a turn-based, sci-fi strategy game that's built to appease power-fantasy lovers and hard-core gamers at the same time. It's a content-rich game filled with challenge, spectacle and enough addicting fun to keep you playing way past your point of "just one more turn."

Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series (iOS, Android)
Telltale

Telltale
Gaming doesn't get more sci-fi and space-centric than Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy adventure. Though it's focused heavily on narrative, this game does feature some fun, interactive fighting segments and has plenty of choice-driven dialogue to keep players engaged. Star-Lord and co. are written to perfection, and the story itself is captivating for Marvel fans and casual gamers alike. As with any Telltale title, it's of a calibur that's rarely found on mobile devices, so savor it as a rare gem of quality portable gaming.

Tales from the Borderlands (iOS, Android)
Tales from the Borderlands

Telltale
For fans of Mad Max and old-school westerns, Tales from the Borderlands is the alt-sci-fi mobile game to get. It's a story-driven trek through sandy wastelands and the desolate emptiness of space, all in search of highly sought-after vault keys. Based in the Borderlands universe, this game will give fans of the series their dose of Pandora-flavored action in a narrative adventure, while everyone else will simply enjoy a darn-good story with some great characters and a killer soundtrack. It's a top-quality game, especially for the mobile scene.

Lego Marvel Super Heroes (iOS, Android)
Lego Marvel Super Heroes (iOS, Android)

Warner Bros.
As with most Lego games, Marvel Super Heroes is a mobile adventure with something for everybody. It's kid-friendly, casual-friendly and a relaxing cruise-control game for hard-core players. Plus, with its Marvel Universe backdrop, it's got plenty of sci-fi thrills for gamers to enjoy, such as flying around as Iron Man or exploring the cosmos via Asgard. If anyone wants a quality Marvel mobile adventure with a lot of content and fun for all ages, Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an easy title to recommend.

Marvel Contest of Champions (iOS, Android)
Marvel Contest of Champions (iOS, Android)

Kabam
Contest of Champions is a fighting game that pits virtually all of Marvel's comic book heroes and villains against one another. From Lady Thor to Red Hulk, almost every iteration of every major Marvel character is present, each armed with his or her own unique supermoves. It's a simplistic game that you can conquer fairly easily via some mindless screen tapping, but given its all-but-endless amount of content, it's a great time sink for Marvel fans and sci-fi geeks with too much time on their hands. It's also the only place you can have Iron Man and Ultron beat the oil out of each other in space (at least on mobile — on consoles and PC, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite offers similar, flashier thrills).

Riptide GP: Renegade (iOS, Android)
Vector Unit

Vector Unit
Riptide GP: Renegade claims to be the future of "illicit hydrojet racing," and it more than lives up to its strange promise. It's got a career mode that explores the "illicit" angle of the title's marketing, and the game's online multiplayer component really excels at spotlighting the fun of Riptide's core hydrojet racing. This feels like a mobile sci-fi racer ripped right out of an actual arcade-racing setup, the kind you and your friend would pay five dollars' worth of quarters to ride in. In short, it's awesome.

Planet Commander (iOS)
Planet Commander (iOS)

Azure Interactive Games Ltd.
If you've ever wanted to be in charge of the flight controls of an Imperial Star Destroyer, then Planet Commander is the game for you. This game lets you build and customize your own armada of ships in order to fight others and claim dominance over the starways; the gameplay includes the ability to challenge real human players online. Planet Commander's core gameplay definitely isn't for everyone, but for those who love the slow, majestic nature of the cruiser battles in Star Wars, this is a neat app to have for mobile intergalactic warfare.

Our choice for today’s game compilation won’t surprise anyone. Battle royale games have been popping up like mushrooms after rain for all platforms and smartphones are no exception.

The genre is pretty straightforward: you have a bunch of players and only one can be the winner, which means everyone else has to die. Many of the titles on our list are trying to replicate the experience offered by the genre’s most popular games, so don’t be surprised by the similarities. Some, however, have gone their own way and feel like a breath of fresh air.

That being said, let’s begin with the first of our top 10 best battle royale games:

Rocket royale

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

Rocket royale has an extremely familiar look but comes with a unique twist in the gameplay. Being the last one standing is not necessary, instead, you have to build your own rocket and get the hell out of the island before someone whacks you. That’s easier said than done, however. First, you need to collect resources from all over the map, then you have to find a few peaceful moments for building, not easy with 24 enemies lurking around. You can build your own fortress to keep others at bay and use a wide variety of weapons to straight-up remove them from the pool of competitors.

If you want to try something more unusual, give Rocket royale a go!

Battlelands Royale

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

Besides the goofy graphics, Battlelands Royale has another thing that makes it pretty unique. It’s the only game on this list that gives the player a top-down view of the battlefield, instead of the standard first or third person camera. This, of course, greatly simplifies the aiming and makes the game a lot more casual than the rest. Games are also shorter so no need to wonder if starting one will have you pinned to your phone for 10 or 30 minutes, 5 is all you need in Battlelands Royale. Jump in, start shooting, get out, easy as that! You don’t like the standard rules? No problem! Create your own custom games, hop in with your friends and wait until others join to start the fun.

Cyber Hunter

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

Cyber Hunter is a game with cool graphics and futuristic weapons, but that’s not the most interesting thing about it. Besides the usual shooting with machine guns and sniper rifles, Cyber Hunter adds another element to the combat: parkour. That’s right, your character can climb buildings, jump and roll around as if its life depended on it. Because it does. If you ever wanted a dash of Assassin’s Creed into your Battle royale experience, this is the game for you. But Cyber Hunter has another trick up its sleeve. Using energy from the quantum cubes you can find around the map you can create powerful devices and even structures that will help you get the W. At the end of the day, a good aim is still what matters most, so start practicing!

Bullet League

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

You might be surprised to hear that there’s such a thing as battle royale platformer. Well, there is and Bullet League is just that. A 2D shooter that will pit you against other players in a nostalgia-inducing environment. The 2D setting means the game will run without a hitch on pretty much any smartphone, which can’t be said for some of the heavier titles on this list. The art of this game is creative and amusing at the same time and give is a casual feel while you jump around shooting machine guns at your cartoonish rivals. We applaud the developers for giving us something so refreshing in the battle royale genre.

OVERDOX

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

OVERDOX is another game in which you’re controlling your character from above but this time there’s no shooting going on. Characters fight with melee weapons in gladiator-style arenas that shrink as time goes by, as is tradition. Besides your weapon of choice, you have two skill slots you can populate with abilities you feel will be most helpful to defeat the other 11 fighters. Apart from surviving, during each round you also have to collect coins or you might not make it to the final area even if you’re still alive when it unlocks. Upgrades and character customizations are plentiful, so there’s plenty of things to waste your hard-earned currency on.

Creative destruction

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

Creative destruction is another beautiful-looking game that bets on the proven formula: Flying vehicle you jump from, an island with destructible buildings and of course, constructing ramps and barriers. Whacky weapons with different rarities are also on board and so is a dedicated FPS mode. Pair in a team with other players or go solo, it’s up to you. The game is regularly updated with new content and events to keep the gameplay from becoming stale. If you like the gameplay Fortnite provides but don’t want to be associated with it in any way, then Creative destruction is the best alternative there is.

Super mecha champions

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

We’ll let you guess what the unique mechanic of this game is… That’s right, there are mechs! Naturally, a game with gundam-style robots must manga-style graphics and Super mecha champions is no exception. The game is everything you’re imagining it to be. You start with one of the regular flesh-over-bones characters and have to earn your right to pilot a fearsome mecha. Shooting enemies, riding hoverboards and eventually hiding behind buildings or flying over them to find the remaining enemies, this game has it all. It’s tons of fun and if you’re a fan of Japanese pop culture already, you’ll love it for sure. One warning, though, the game is quite large, over 2GB, so make sure you have enough space on your phone before you get all enthusiastic about it.

Coming to the last three games, you probably already know which ones they are, but that doesn’t mean we can afford to skip them, so here’s the battle royale triumvirate!

Call of Duty Mobile

Download from Google Play Store
Download from Apple App Store

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

Call of Duty came late to the battle royale stage but with the massive following the franchise has, it quickly overshadowed if not Fortnite, then at least PubG. With graphics as good as they get on mobile, multiple game modes and high-paced action, CoD mobile has rightfully earned the reputation of one of the best shooters for smartphones. And what’s more thrilling than 100 people armed to the teeth fighting for survival? Run them over with a vehicle, blow them up with a grenade or snipe them from half a mile away, the opportunities are endless. The popularity of CoD ensures you’ll never have to spend much time waiting in lobbies, which is always a plus.

PubG Mobile

But maybe you’re not into some of the arcade elements Call of Duty adds to the action and prefer to play one of the OG battle royales. PubG bets on realism whenever possible while still providing engaging gameplay. Good graphics, familiar weapons, sneaky tactics and more customization options than you know what to do with, what more can you want? Actually, the game now offers something people probably never thought to request: an in-game amusement park. A special addition for the game’s two-year anniversary. If you haven’t played PubG for a while, now is the time to come back!

Fortnite

10 best battle royale games for Android and iOS

And at last, we come to Fortnite. If you have even a slight interest in gaming, there’s no way you haven’t heard of it. Hell, even people that haven’t played a video game in their life (usually parents) know about it and have seen the dreaded floss dance. Well, there’s a reason the game got popular in that’s because it’s a great game. Mastering the various weapons is just as important as being a quick builder and if you’re good at both your chances of being the last one standing improve dramatically. The different seasons the game is switching between regularly ensure there’s always something new to look forward to and entertain yourself with in-game. Fortnite is the game that made battle royale part of pop culture and for that, it deserves to be the final title of our compilation.
