Stardew Valley best Android gamepad support games


The market for games with controller support is growing. Android TV, the Nvidia Shield Console, and other systems are putting games with gamepad support on the forefront and making them more popular. The proliferation of gamepads and Bluetooth controllers have made playing games on your mobile devices with a controller easier than ever before. Why not play some wicked good games with it? Here are the best games with gamepad support for Android. Please note that there are some older games with excellent controller support like Star Wars: KOTOR and The Bard’s Tale. However, many of those older controller games haven’t been updated in years and we can’t guarantee that they’ll work with newer controllers, newer versions of Android, or newer devices. You can try those at your own risk.

Bridge Constructor Portal
Price: Free / $4.99

Bridge Constructor Portal is a crossover game between the popular Bridge Constructor series and the Portal PC franchise. The mechanics are mostly Bridge Constructor. You build bridges with various materials to get from one end of the level to the other. There are portals to make things easier (or harder) as well as cameos from popular characters like GLaDOS. It’s a delightful puzzle game experience and one of the few with controller support. You also get Google Play Games achievements and support for tablets. The game runs for $4.99 with no in-app purchases or ads. We like this one a lot and it’s free if you use Google Play Pass.

Crossy Road
Price: Free to play

Crossy Road is one of the most popular mobile games ever. It also has MFi controller support. This is basically the mobile gaming version of Frogger. You move the chicken forward across roads, streams, and other obstacles while avoiding being run over by cars or falling in the water. It’s a simple game with fun graphics and easy controls. It’s also safe for older kids. This is a free to play game, but the in-app purchases are mostly for extra characters. This is a good one and it supports Android TV as well.

Endurance
Price: Free / $3.49

Endurance is one of the newer games with gamepad support. It’s a retro style action shooter with roguelike and dungeon crawler mechanics. Players head to Endurance, a ship where a virus spread and caused people to go insane. It’s technically a prequel to the developer’s other game, Ailment, but you can play it on its own if you want to. The game features tons of weapons, plenty of action, and a pretty decent little story. The game can stutter on older, midrange, or lower end devices and the free version has some long ads. However, you can easily buy the premium version to remove ads and the rest is tolerable. This is a pretty decent game and so is Ailment.

Evoland 2
Price: $7.99

Evoland is one of the most unique game franchises on mobile. It doesn’t use any one particular style or genre. Evoland 2, the latest game in the series, employs platformer, fighter, top-down shooter, trading card, and RPG mechanics. The game also changes its graphics up quite a bit to match the style of game play. That makes it one of the most unique experiences on mobile. The developers boast support for most types of Bluetooth controllers as well as Nvidia Shield support. The first Evoland is also quite good and supports hardware controllers as well. The publisher, Playdigious, also has Dead Cells, another excellent game with gamepad support that was launched in 2020.

GRID Autosport
Price: $9.99

GRID Autosport is one of the newest games with gamepad support. It’s also one of the best racer’s we’ve seen in a while. In short, this is a port of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 racing game along with all of its DLC under one roof. There are over 100 cars, over 100 circuits to race, scalable difficulty, and a variety of race types. It also supports offline game play if you want to go that route. Frankly, this game has a ton of upside and not that much downside. Most of the complaints are for the on-screen controls, but that’s not why you’re here so it doesn’t matter all that much. The game runs for $9.99 with no in-app purchases.

Price: $6.99

Levelhead is one of those special games that only comes out every few years. It’s a platformer with outstanding execution, good mechanics, and a level builder for extra depth. The game has a simple premise. You help deliver packages through a variety of training courses with various and ridiculous obstacles. Even when it launched it had virtually no bugs or issues that we could find. This one of those legendary mobile games that should be way more popular than it really is. Plus, it’s cross-platform with the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PC, and iOS so you can play it on multiple platforms if you want to. It’s crazy good, trust us. It’s also free if you use Google Play Pass. The developer is the same one that makes Crashlands and we absolutely recommend that one for this very list as well.

Minecraft
Price: $6.99 with in-app purchases

Minecraft is one of the most popular games out there. It drops you into randomly generated worlds with plenty of stuff to do. You can build, you can mine, you can farm, and there is even a final boss to kill. Updates in 2017 aligned the game with its console and PC counterparts. That means you can start a world in one game and then play it on another system entirely. This is one of the few games with that level of cross-play support. It’s $6.99 for the game. The in-app purchases are optional aesthetic things like character skins.

Oddmar
Price: Free / $4.99

Oddmar is a newer platformer from the developers of Leo’s Fortune. It’s a side-scrolling platformer with a narrative story, pleasing graphics, and simple mechanics. You play as a disgraced viking looking to get his honor back. The game boasts 24 levels, various power items, and offline support after the initial download. There are also Google Play Games cloud saves and achievements. The game has a free demo mode and a $4.99 price tag for the rest of the game. Of course, it supports controllers as well.

Portal Knights
Price: $4.99 / $0.99

Portal Knights is another adventure game. This one launched in late 2017. The game boasts action-adventure game play mechanics, boss fights, RPG level progression, a crafting system, local multiplayer (on the same WiFi), random events, and, of course, controller support. This is actually fairly close to a console level title in terms of execution. Of course, the graphics are mobile friendly. This one goes for $4.99 with some optional in-app purchases. It’s had the occasional bug, but it worked fine during our testing. This game is also free for those with Google Play Pass.

Riptide GP series
Price: $0.99-$2.99

Vector Unit has some real winners with the Riptide series. They are a trio of racing games that take place on jet skis. Your goal will be to race them, perform stunts, and make it to the end. The stunts give you boost. Thus, the better stunts you do, the faster you can go as long as you actually use the boost you get. The games get progressively more complex and better as they go. The first one is the weakest of the three. The third one is the strongest. Thankfully, they’re all fairly inexpensive. The second has in-app purchases but you totally don’t need them to enjoy the game. All three games have gamepad support.

SEGA Forever
Price: Free / $1.99 each

SEGA recently started doing something called SEGA Forever. It’s essentially porting many of its classic titles to mobile. Some of the games include Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2, Altered Beast, Kid Chamaleon, and Phantasy Star II. There are more than a dozen others and the collection is growing at a healthy pace. Most of the games include solid controller support. They’re relatively new. Thus, they do have some issues. However, each game is free to download with ads. You can pay $1.99 as an in-app purchase to remove ads.

Stardew Valley
Price: $7.99

Stardew Valley is one of the newer games with controller support. It’s a farming simulator with RPG elements. You create a farm, raise your crops, and live a life. The game has your usual farming game staples like gathering and selling crops and animals of various types. However, this one adds additional elements like being social with the nearby townspeople and even things like seasonal events and weddings. It’s a deep game with a long play time and that helps justify its $7.99 price tag. This is easily one of the best games of 2019 and it has controller support!

Steam Link
Price: Free

Steam Link isn’t a game. However, it lets you play games. It connects your phone to your computer. The app then streams your PC games to your phone, Android TV device, tablet, etc with full controller support. This lets you play PC games from the comfort of your living room (for Android TV devices) or anywhere in your house (for mobile devices). This is a beta app and it has plenty of bugs to flush out. However, PC gaming with a controller on a mobile device is basically the dream and this is as close to it as you can get right now.

Stickman Skate Battle
Price: Free to play

Stickman Skate Battle is another decent sports game with controller support. This one is more of an arcade game compared to the more complete experience of Skateboard Party 3. You go head to head in various game modes to score the most points or do the best tricks. Additionally, it has a practice mode, daily and weekly tournaments, and it works in offline mode. Plus, it has Android TV and Nvidia Shield support as well. It’s a good, family friendly arcade skateboard game. It is a free to play game, though, but it’s not the worst free to play experience we’ve had.

UNKILLED
Price: Free to play

Unkilled is one of the best first person shooters available right now. It has pretty much everything you’d want. That includes over 300 campaign missions. It also has online PvP.

Bonus: Some Gameloft games
Price: Varies

Gameloft has a bunch of games and many of them have controller support. That includes updates games like Asphalt 8: Airborne, Asphalt Xtreme, Order & Chaos 2, and Modern Combat 5: Blackout. That’s a good mixture of racing games, MMORPGs, and first person shooters. The controller support is above average compared to most games and that’s one of the better aspects to Gameloft’s titles. They are all free to play games and the free to play strategy could be better. However, they are current, accessible, and they have game pad support for a variety of controllers. Gameloft also has a list of games with controller support. We linked it at the button if you want to see their other options.

Bonus: Nvidia Shield games with controller support
Price: Varies

Nvidia worked hard to bring a lot of games to the forefront. Unfortunately, all of them are for Android TV. However, that means they all have gamepad support without exception. Those looking for controller games on Android should definitely check out Nvidia’s hardware first. There are some really good games in their lineup. That includes Portal, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Resident Evil 5, and many more newer games. The only downside is that these games only work with Nvidia Shield hardware, such as the Nvidia Shield TV. Other than that, these games are all console quality in terms of graphics, content, and controller support.

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp
Price: Free to play

Nintendo actually has an Animal Crossing game on mobile. The official game isn’t nearly as open or as large as the Nintendo Switch version, but it has a lot of the same elements. You start out with a campsite and then you add to it with a bunch of stuff you discover as you play. The game boasts over 1,000 pieces of furniture, 300 pieces of clothing, and a variety of mini-games for plenty to do. It’s as close as it gets to a true Animal Crossing experience on mobile because it is an actual Animal Crossing game.

Castaway Paradise
Price: Free to play

Castaway Paradise was the premiere Animal Crossing clone on mobile for a few years. It has a lot of the same stuff. You start out on an island and then do things like fish, catch bugs, decorate your house, plant stuff, and even do quests for villagers. The UI is a tad cluttered and difficult for new players and the camera movement could definitely be better. Plus, there are some other bugs. It’s not quite the game it once was, but it’s still one of the decent games like Animal Crossing on mobile.

Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked
Price: $4.99

Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked doesn’t have the cutesy, relaxed nature of Animal Crossing. It does have a lot of the same ideas, though. You start out on a deserted island and you set out to collect things and craft things to make it yours. The primary difference is a survival element so you have to actually stay alive long enough to do all of the activities. The game is a bit buggy on occasion and the controller support could be better. Other than that, it’s a decent survival sim about fixing up a deserted island to make it your own.

Emulators
Price: Free / $4.99

There are several Animal Crossing games on older consoles. Unfortunately, some of them aren’t available without emulation and so we recommend an emulator. The three we think are best for this are DraStic DS Emulator (linked at the button), M64Plus FZ (Nintendo 64),  and Dolphin Emulator. With those three, you can play the original Animal Crossing (Nintendo 64 or GameCube, your choice) and Animal Crossing: Wild World (Nintendo DS). We don’t condone piracy so please have original copies of the game so it’s not illegal. Emulators are the best way to experience Animal Crossing on mobile as long as you do it legally.

Harvest Moon: Seeds of Memories
Price: $9.99

Harvest Moon is one of the biggest Animal Crossing competitors and there is a full game on mobile. The game is heavily based on Harvest Moon 3D: The Lost Valley but it’s not an actual port, but an original game in the series. You can do a lot of the usual stuff like plant stuff, engage with villagers, find pets, and more. It’s a little bit closer to a farming sim than it is a life sim such as Animal Crossing so the tone and feeling is a lot different. However, the activities are similar and the game is fairly relaxing and chill. The game goes for $9.99 with no in-app purchases or ads, but is often on sale for half price. There are also some bugs associated with this one, so make sure to give it a good testing before the refund period ends in case it doesn’t work on your phone.

Happy Street
Price: Free to play

Happy Street is a 2D hybrid of a city building sim, farming, and social sim. You build up a town for the benefit of its citizens, collect various resources, farm stuff, customize your character, and explore the surrounding areas. It’s not quite as in-depth as a real Animal Crossing game, but there is definitely enough there to scratch that proverbial itch. It’s a reasonably chill game and you can play it at your own pace. The only downside is it seems to really want you to use a Facebook account.

Minecraft (or Terraria)
Price: $6.99 with in-app purchases

Minecraft is a classic game. It’s a decent alternative for the same reason Don’t Starve works as an alternative. You can farm things, craft things, explore, build your own buildings, and do basically whatever you want. It’s true, you don’t get the relaxing feel of Animal Crossing nor are there cute talking animals. However, every other part of the game is here in some capacity. You can go fishing, although it’s admittedly not as entertaining in Minecraft as it is in Animal Crossing. Terraria is obviously a great alternative to Minecraft. You can go with either one.

Poom Games
Price: Free to play

Poom Games is a developer on Google Play with a couple of games like Animal Crossing. The first is Cat Forest. You start out at a campsite, collect visitors, and do a bunch of other things. Players can gather stuff, build stuff, grow stuff, and a little bit more. The second option is Animal Camp and it’s a building sim about an island resort town. It plays very much like Cat Forest except there are more animals than cats and it’s on an island instead of in a forest. Both of them are decent choices as time killers.

Seabeard
Price: Free to play

Seabeard is one of the older staples for games like Animal Crossing. You start out as a pirate and from there you can do basically whatever you want. Some of the stuff you can do includes exploring the nearby islands, cook food, meet characters, trade stuff, and even rescue other shipwrecked people. The free to play elements are a little less than desirable, but the game doesn’t really require them all that much. This one has been around for about six years now and it has six years of maturity to build in its content.

Stardew Valley
Price: $6.99

Stardew Valley is an excellent alternative to Animal Crossing for the same reason Harvest Moon works as an alternative. You don’t get the cutesy animals or the super chill feel, but everything else is there. You build up your abandoned farm, do stuff for and with the local townspeople, go fishing, craft things, grow plants, and a lot more. To be honest, we’d recommend this one first over Harvest Moon because it is in active development and seems to have way fewer bugs. Plus, this one is free if you use Google Play Pass and $6.99 without it (with no in-app purchases).

Most of those issues are gone and the game is actually quite good.

Simply get these emulators, find the games, and play. Most emulators have the basics like fast forward modes, save and load states, cheat code support, and more.

Monster Hunter Stories is kind of like Pokemon for adults. It’s a full JRPG title with a narrative story line, excellent mechanics, and a ton of stuff to do.

The free demo is actually a prequel to the main game and you can port your save to the main version if you decide to buy it. It’s quite expensive at $19.99 but there are no extra in-app purchases to gum up the works. Most of the complaints are minor, especially with recent updates to fix a lot of the issues.
