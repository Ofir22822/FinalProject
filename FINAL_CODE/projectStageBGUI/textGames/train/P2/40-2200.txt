These are the 10 best games of 2019

2019 has been an excellent year for games, so here’s our pick of the top titles of the last 12 months.
By Ben Sillis and Jamie Hunt-StevensonPublished on 12/03/2019 · 3:17 PM IST
2018 was big. A year of classics, from Red Dead Redemption 2 to Spider Man and God of War, it was always going to be a tough act to follow. 2019, however, has made a fair swing of it, offering incredible indies, blistering blockbusters and stunning sequels. Here, in no particular order, we run through our favourite games of the past 12 months; whether you’re interested in sword-swinging samurai, brilliant battle royales, or wreaking havoc with a haughty goose, 2019 had something for you.

How Katana Zero cuts its way to a surprisingly deep story
Katana Zero came out to raucous acclaim in April, but a lot of people were shocked by its in-depth narrative. We caught up with developer Justin Stander to discuss how he pulled it off.

We speak with creators of this epic new game on colonising brave new worlds, making your character dumb and why space is so terrifying.

Embracing a retro aesthetic can be a tricky thing. If it works, it works brilliantly – look no further than Netflix’s Stranger Things to see the level of success carefully embraced nostalgia can bring. When it goes wrong, well, things can get desperate – you can go from cool to kitsch, very quickly. Katana Zero, with its ‘80s neon, pulsing soundtrack and VHS video-like style, is an exercise in retro perfection – cool as a cucumber, slick as oil and more brutally violent than the Paul Verhoeven pics of the era it was inspired by.
The game puts you in the frankly fabulous robe of the titular Zero, a ruthless assassin traumatised by a murky past, seemingly exploited by shadowy figures. Offered assignments (read: targets) by a not-entirely-benevolent psychiatrist, the player is asked to slash their way through neon-drenched levels as a surprisingly deep story unspools, with the player tasked with making difficult dialogue choices that even allow you to cut off conversations that aren’t to your liking.
The work of developers Askiisoft and published by Devolver Digital (whose Hotline Miami is a key touchpoint for the game’s brutal violence and uncompromising swagger), Katana Zero adds depth to destruction, but never loses sight of one pure truth: swinging a sword through a swathe of bad guys to a synth soundtrack is deeply, deeply cool.
Luigi's Mansion 3
(Nintendo, Nintendo Switch)

Poor old Luigi, plain and tall. Always forever in his (shorter) brother’s shadow, yet there’s a strong argument that he’s the real star plumber of the pair. Luigi’s Mansion 3 might just be the most adorable, polished game featuring either brother this generation, and it’s mostly down to him. The way he runs, the way he drops everything in fright, the way he congratulates himself on a job well done. Adorable. They might as well have called it Luigi’s Mannerisms.
The premise is much the same as the two previous entries: you creep around a haunted building, solving puzzles and sucking up ghosts with your vacuum cleaner. But the scale is drastically ramped up: this is a 17-storey hotel rather than a mere mansion and you can also create a clone of yourself out of slime (Gooigi) when teamwork is called for. With floors including a shopping mall, a pirate ship, a film studio and an ancient Egyptian pyramid, it’s not much of a spoiler to say that Nintendo don’t seem to know what a hotel is, or a mansion for that matter, but that’s besides the point when you’re having this much fun, and Luigi absolutely is not.
Untitled Goose Game

“Guys, hear me out, it’s Hitman, only with waterfowl.”
As pitches go, this is surely up there with the weirdest and yet the general bi-partisan internet consensus was that this was the best thing ever when a short preview was published online by Australian developers House House in 2017. And as it turned out when the game finally hit this autumn, it is. You’re a goose. You walk around a quaint British village ruining the locals’ days, crossing off your goose to-do list by lobbing slippers into the pond, stealing the possessions of small children right off their faces and hiding in bushes.
This is a small, tight game, but the options you have to achieve your goals are as numerous as the laughs along the way. Do you lure the market seller away from her stall by breaking her broom, stealing her pricing gun and dumping it in the canal? Or do you put a walkie-talkie in the garage, honk into it to gain her attention, then lock her in? It’s up to you. It’s this sandbox approach that means the critical acclaim House House earned has been well deserved. This is the best indie game of the year, and one of the best games full stop. But you don’t care. Why would you? You’re a goose. You just want to watch the world burn. Honk.
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
(From Software, PC, Xbox One, PS4)

Seriously, this game can get in the sea. If we were going to do a games-that-annoyed-us-the-most-this-year award, Sekiro would also be on it. It’s just so merciless. This third-person action game is faster, and in some respects arguably even harder than the punishing Dark Souls games that made From Software famous. You’re an undead samurai in a fantasy Japan; needless to say you have to zip around, clashing against titanically frustrating bosses that may cause you to scythe your controller in half. As always with From’s games, Sekiro does not value your time. Not until you start to learn the rhythms and intricate manoeuvres of your opponents, really watch them, or face restarting yet again, that is, at which point you’re rewarded with one of the most absorbing games of the year, in any genre. Don’t fight, dance.
Apex Legends

Look, we’re used to the waiting game. Staring at the calendar, tapping our watches and desperately searching for nuggets of info on a game seemingly announced aeons ago is now par for the course for the modern gamer. What we’re not used to, is one of the year’s biggest releases being dropped on us (and in this case, dropped is appropriate) with so little notice we barely had time to pick up our pads.
Apex Legends, the incredible battle royale title from Respawn, makers of the equally incredible but sadly ignored Titanfall 2, was launched the day it was announced. This unheard-of strategy could well have been the gimmick Apex became known for, but Respawn are frankly too good at what they do for that ever to be the case.
Apex Legends arrived fully formed, with brilliant characters, fluid action, and a ‘Ping’ system that eased the reliance on microphones for players – making this free-to-play game even more accessible for anyone left intimidated by its genre forebears. With battle royales dominating the gaming landscape for the latter half of the decade, Apex may very well be their, well, apex.
The Outer Worlds
(Obsidian, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)

The New Vegas spiritual successor we longed for
© OBSIDIAN
Anticipation was high for Obsidian’s return to the open-world RPG and with good reason. The developers behind the stellar Fallout: New Vegas (the spin-off which many franchise fans argue is the peak of the series) had shown they could spin a brilliant yarn which delivered shades of grey as well as splashes of crimson. A long time coming, The Outer Worlds did not disappoint – marrying moral uncertainty, frenetic action and a bright, dangerous new world where players could either toe the corporate line or fight the power.
Arriving on the world of Halcyon after an extra-long cryonap (your ship was handily lost in space for 70 years), its unabashed consumerism and corporate greed (sound familiar?) sees your befuddled character plunged into the deep end of a society in violent flux. If that all sounds a bit on the heavy side, fear not – Obsidian’s sparky sense of humour and brilliant sense of memorable, loveable characters is apparent throughout, while combat is nicely varied.
The level of decision-making, however, and the way in which you can choose to grease the corporate wheels or throw a spanner in them, is where the game truly comes to life. Choice is everything in The Outer Worlds, and the pointed questions the game asks make its satire even sharper. Oh, and it’s loads of fun, too.
Gears 5
(Microsoft, PC and Xbox One)
The Gears of War series may have shortened its name, but the epic scope and stunning graphics the series of third-party cover shooters is known for remain. This is the prettiest, shootiest, most bug-exploding game of this console generation, with a touching story in the single campaign and several open-world areas that remove the on-rails feel of previous instalments to armoured boot. Incidentally, Gears 5 has been free from launch as part of Xbox Games Pass, so if you’ve got a PC or an Xbox One, there’s really no reason not to sign up and check it out (skip the multiplayer though).
Wargroove
(Chucklefish, Nintendo Switch)

Tactics are back
© CHUCKLEFISH
Advance Wars! With puppies! Chucklefish’ Wargroove is very much our groove, the pixel stylings of the publisher’s mega-hit Stardew Valley combined with the turn-based units-on-a-grid combat of Intelligent Systems’ games for older Nintendo handhelds – on a new Nintendo handheld. We’re always down for a new take on the sub-genre pioneered by Final Fantasy Tactics, but in truth, this game would never have made our top 10 were it not for the developer's nimble approach to critical feedback, rapidly patching in solutions to major complaints like the difficulty level and lack of mid-game save points. Wargroove is a much more accessible game for them and a serious alternative to Fire Emblems: Three Heroes for those who want the strategy without the dating sim bolted on.
Control
(Remedy, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)

Control’s Jesse Faden is a complex character

Norman Bates’s assertion that ‘we all go a little mad sometimes’ seems to be something ace developers Remedy have taken to heart. The team behind Alan Wake and Max Payne have built something beautiful, brutal, and absolutely, unabashedly bonkers. Attempting to sum up the game’s story is tricky in itself: You assume the role of Jesse Faden, director of the Federal Bureau of Control (an organisation which is a sort-of corporate ghostbusters). You’re tasked with exploring The Oldest House (a House of Leaves-esque building with a loose sense of architecture and filled with supernatural entities) as you hunt for your brother.
This, however, is merely scratching the surface of a twisty, mind-bending narrative that escalates in lunacy as the player progresses through The Oldest House’s brutally beautiful corridors. Its ambition is vast – The Oldest House is explorable and almost everything is able to be manipulated by characters’ minds – though its combat and puzzling is remarkably clear-minded, offering satisfaction and a devilish challenge in equal measure. One of the strangest and best games of the year, Control make us wish more developers would embrace their mad side.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
(Respawn Entertainment, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)
Uncharted meets Dark Souls but you get to use a lightsaber.
Okay fine, we’ll go a little further, though that description alone should inform players of why Fallen Order is gracing GOTY lists. In a year choc-full of Star Wars, from the final part in the sequel trilogy to the excellent The Mandalorian TV show, Respawn Entertainment (yes, them again) have delivered something special: a third-person adventure that truly makes you feel a part of the universe.
Taking place shortly after the events of Revenge of the Sith, as Cal Estis, one of the few remaining Jedi padawan, you’re tasked with evading Imperial forces while trying to find a way to restore the Jedi Order. Armed with a lightsaber from the get-go, Cal Estis is a brilliantly lithe protagonist, capable of leaping and swinging like a less desperate Nathan Drake and also of dispatching a group of stormtroopers with balletic swordplay. And the combat is incredible – modeled after the Souls games, this is no button bash, swing-and-hope experience. A lax attitude to enemies will be your downfall and adds greater stakes to each encounter.
Characters are memorable, the voice acting superb and the settings are stunning. While the story that unfolds is exciting and, at times, surprising, what’s most important is that this feels like Star Wars. That, and you’re able to force-push enemies off cliffs. Need we say more?

The Best Games For The PS5
Illustration: Angelica Alzona
Congratulations! You weathered the queues and were able to nab a PlayStation 5. You’ve somehow finagled the thing into your TV stand and turned it on without issue. So, what comes next? Of all the options at your fingertips, which games deserve your time and energy?

First, know this: The vast majority of games playable on the PS4 are playable on the PS5 via backward compatibility. (Here’s our list of the best games for that console.) Beyond that, members of the PS Plus subscription service get access to the PS Plus Collection, a perk that offers some of the most acclaimed PS4 games — including Bloodborne, Uncharted 4, and God of War — at no extra cost. All of those titles are downloadable from the PS5’s dashboard. No matter what, you’ll rarely be short of terrific things to play on the PS5.

But if you’re looking for something suitably cutting-edge — something designed with this new console in mind — you needn’t look far. Plenty of great games released across generations, with the superior versions, no surprise, out on the PS5. The system has fewer next-gen-only offerings at this point, but the few it has are an impressive lot. Here, without further ado, are the best games for the PS5.

(A quick note for Kotaku regulars: As with any console launch, the early offerings aren’t exactly robust. To that end, we’re capping our console-launch Bests lists at just six games, rather than the usual 12, and limiting it to those with truly new-gen versions. For great backward-compatible PS4 games, consult the links above. We’ll update this post as additional worthy PS5 games release in the coming months.)

Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Spider-Man: Miles Morales is everything its predecessor (2018’s Spider-Man) was and more. Playing as Miles Morales gives you access to a far deeper bag of tricks than Peter Parker had at his disposal. You can still swing from Harlem to Fidi in seconds, but can bust out more than 20 stylish SSX-style flips along the way, rather than just a handful. Miles also has a literally shocking set of powers that augment his strikes, and can turn invisible at the drop of a hat. Beyond the toolkit, the narrative is tighter, more personal, and more contained than the 2018 game’s. (Full disclosure: Kotaku alum Evan Narcisse wrote for the game.) Also, there’s a cat suit. (See above.) Of course, since this is a next-gen launch title and all, you’re probably wondering about visual enhancements and the like. The answer is yes, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is quite a looker, featuring two different rendering modes that prioritise either razor-sharp resolution and image quality or a smooth framerate of 60 fps. Both are stunning. Just like this game.

A Good Match For: Fans of action games. Friendly neighbourhood heroes. Manhattanites (have fun tracking down your office or apartment).

Not A Good Match For: Rhino. Anyone looking for a 700-hour time-sink; Miles Morales can be fully completed in under 30 hours.

Godfall
Godfall is the spitting image of what you’d picture from an ideal launch game: a showcase of spectacle and technical swank with some seriously tight combat to boot. Sure, the story is eye-rolling, and the loot grind is, yes, another loot grind. But the minute-to-minute gameplay — straightforward third-person, monster-killing action — is so satisfying that Godfall isn’t tough to recommend on PS5, especially considering the dearth of games truly designed for the console. As for the endgame? Play it, don’t play it; the choice is yours. Not every game needs to be an endless daily commitment. You can wring plenty of enjoyment out of Godfall from the main campaign. Godfall knows exactly what it is and doesn’t try to be anything more (or less).

A Good Match For: Fans of action games, hack-and-slash games, particle effects, particle effects, particle effects, and Captain America. (There’s a throwable shield. It rules.)

Not A Good Match For: Folks looking for something ambitious or unique. Anyone who hates using the shoulder buttons to attack; Godfall doesn’t currently allow for full button-remapping.

Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
By now, you probably think you know what you’re getting with Assassin’s Creed. That’s what makes Assassin’s Creed Valhalla such a pleasant surprise. Though unmistakably more similar to the recent series entries (Origins, Odyssey) than the middle-aged ones (Syndicate, Black Flag), Valhalla is very much its own creature. For one thing, side-quests don’t exist at all, supplanted instead by a dizzying amount of bespoke narrative vignettes and environmental challenges. For another, the narrative is vivisected regionally, so you get a bunch of shorter main arcs alongside an overarching narrative (kind of like a long-running, well-crafted TV series). And the setting — England and Norway in the late-9th century — is distinct, at least in the video game world. That it’s rendered so marvelously is just icing on the cake; you can practically taste the crunchy autumnal leaves of Cent and Sciropescire.

A Good Match For: Fans of massive, compelling open-world games — including the prior two Assassin’s Creeds — and historical drama.

Not A Good Match For: Players tired of Ubisoft “map” games. Anyone not down to play a morally dubious raider.

Demon’s Souls
Although the PlayStation 5 might not have a lot to offer right now, the Demon’s Souls remake developed by Bluepoint Games is one of the best console launch titles in recent memory. It maintains most of what made the PlayStation 3 original so special, sprucing things up a bit with a massive upgrade to visual fidelity and some very useful quality-of-life updates. It may not be the best or most fulfilling Souls adventure — a high bar — but Demon’s Souls both justifies making the jump to a next-generation system and solidifies Bluepoint as a studio we’d want to remake our favourite games if and when the time comes.

A Good Match For: Demon’s Souls fans who don’t mind a few aesthetic changes, folks looking for a relatively easy entry point into the Souls series, and anyone who doesn’t mind a good challenge.

Not A Good Match For: Demon’s Souls fans who wanted just a straight-up port. Players who want their games to be as free of frustration as possible.

Astro’s Playroom
Astro’s Playroom may be a free game, coming pre-installed on every PS5, but that doesn’t make it a wash. Make no mistake: It’s a delightful platformer, oozing with charm and effervescence. You play as a cheery, emotive robotoid (an Astro bot). Each level is themed after some technological aspect of the PS5 — Memory Meadow, for instance, offers winks and nods to the system’s technical guts, while SSD Speedway pays homage to the internal storage — and switches seamlessly between two- and three-dimensional perspectives. As you play, you’ll uncover various references to PlayStation history, which get stored in a museum-like collection. The main draw, though, is how it feels. No other game currently utilises the DualSense’s cutting-edge haptics as well as Astro’s Playroom. You’ll use motion controls to scale a cliff one minute; the next, you’ll blow on the microphone to propel yourself forward. All the while, the controller hums with a responsive, reactive vibration that’s so much more than, “Hey, look, you just got attacked.” This may sound like sacrilege, but Astro’s Playroom may be the most Nintendo-feeling game released this fall.

A Good Match For: Anyone who hasn’t had the pleasure of using the PS5’s DualSense controller. PlayStation devotees. Mario fans.

Not A Good Match For: Dude, it’s free, and is already installed on your console. Give it a whirl!

The Pathless
From the Mongolian throat singing in the menu to the world that’s both awash in colour and yet muted with the darkness you’ve been sent to vanquish, The Pathless is an artistic feast for the senses. New from Giant Squid — the makers of the lush underwater explorer ABZÛ — The Pathless is an action-adventure puzzle game in which you play as The Hunter. Together with your handy bird companion, you are tasked with rescuing the four children of the Eagle Mother from the evil Godslayer. The Pathless is a lot like bread — it doesn’t need a lot of ingredients to be good. The game gives you a bow and bird and sets you loose upon a mysterious island where it’s up to you to figure out the rest. “The rest” is a lot of simple but intuitive puzzle solving involving trick shots and bird-assisted platforming. The Pathless is an art museum of a game, meant to evoke emotion and wonder as you explore the breathtaking mountains, grasslands, rivers, and ruined temples. It’s also part bird-care simulator, letting you give pets to your eagle companion whenever you like.

A Good Match For: Players who still want a well-written action game but need a break from the big-budget bombast of Spider-Man: Miles Morales or Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.

Not A Good Match For: Players who need a little direction in where to go, what to do, and how to do it next.

The Best Games For The Xbox Series X And S

The Best Games For The Xbox Series X And S
Illustration: Angelica Alzona
A new console generation usually means a new library of games. That’s not exactly the case with Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, at least not yet. There are few true next-gen exclusives. Instead, several recent Xbox games were released in both last-gen and next-gen versions.

Meanwhile, a handful of legacy Xbox One titles have received “optimised” versions for the Series X and S. (In other words: sharper resolutions and higher framerates.) Amid the 30 or so “optimised” games, there are some true gems. Though you can technically play all of them elsewhere, they perform notably better on these new consoles.

Yes, the Xbox Series X and S are basically suped-up Xbox Ones, which means you’ll rarely be pressed for awesome games to play. A good rule of thumb is this: If it was playable on the Xbox One, it’s playable on the Xbox Series X and S. (To that end, here’s our list of the best games for the Xbox One.) There’s also the matter of a little service called Game Pass. For $15 a month, you can access a library of more than 100 Xbox games, including standout exclusives like Forza Horizon 4 and third-party hits like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. (Hey, look, here’s our list of the best games on Game Pass.) With all that in mind, here are the best games for the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S.

(A quick note for Kotaku regulars: As with any console launch, the early offerings aren’t exactly robust. To that end, we’re capping our console-launch Bests lists at just six games, rather than the usual 12, and limiting it to those with truly new-gen versions.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps
Ori and the Will of the Wisps was already one of the best platformers of 2020. Following a launch-day update for the Xbox Series X and S, it’s even better, and includes video settings that support supersampled 6K resolution at 60 fps. (If you have a fancy enough screen, the game can run in 4K at 120 frames per second.) The biggest knock against Ori and the Will of the Wisps was that, at launch, it was marred by some performance issues: lockups, screen stutters, things of that nature. All such issues are wholly eliminated on the Series X. Ori now leaps through the whimsical magic-forest of Niwen with the precision and dexterity of an Olympic gymnast. Menus and combat are smooth as butter, as are character animations. In short, one of 2020’s best platformers is officially one of its best-performing ones, too.

A Good Match For: Fans of airtight platforming, Studio Ghibli-like art direction, and whimsical forest spirits.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone looking for an easy game. Big criers.

Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Round any corner in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and you’ll stumble upon something fascinating. Despite the game’s staggering size, you won’t find any traditional, cookie-cutter side-quests. Rather, Valhalla’s open-world take on 9th-century England and Norway is dotted with brief activities called World Events. They’re all bespoke, and vary from platforming challenges to environmental puzzles to brief, narrative vignettes. The narrative structure, too, consistently surprises. Alongside an overarching story, each one of the map’s dozen or so regions has its own self-contained set of missions. But recurrent characters pop up, giving you the feeling that you’re playing through (very murder-happy) seasons of a TV show. Combine all that with the RPG elements that made the more recent series entries (Origins and Odyssey) so awesome and you have a standout game. Oh yeah, and the hidden blade is back.

A Good Match For: Fans of Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey, or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Renaissance Faire attendees. Anyone with 1,645 hours to burn.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone who has a fear of consequences; the choices you make in the main story will bite you in unexpected, Witcher-y ways.

Tetris Effect: Connected
Here’s the pitch: Tetris, but with friends. And EDM. And an incandescent light show constructed from some of the snazziest particle effects in gaming. Yes, Tetris Effect: Connected is an audiovisual delight, one that packs even more punch since we’re not allowed to go to raves in 2020. As for how it plays, the foundation remains unchanged from Alexey Pajitnov’s 1984 original. But there are plenty of modal twists and reworks. The best is a multiplayer mode, called “Connected,” wherein you and two other players team up to “fight” against a series of bosses, who flip the script in unexpected ways. (Maybe you’ll have your board inverted, or you’ll find a super-sized brick in your queue.) After a minute or so, the music drops, your three boards fuse together as one, and you take turns placing pieces wherever you want — with the goal of clearing triple-wide lines — before reverting to your own solo space. It breathes new life into the most quintessential classic, all while paying homage to what made the original so enduringly special in the first place.

A Good Match For: Fans of covers that sound like brand-new songs but retain the same tune. Anyone who’s spent hours playing Tetris on a smartphone and craves a bigger screen.

Not A Good Match For: Those with photosensitivity issues; the game warns you up front that the game could “trigger dizzy spells or epileptic seizures in a small percentage of people.”

Gears Tactics
You know Gears of War as the brawniest Xbox series, but it’s also one of the brainiest ones. Gears Tactics, which first released on PC before receiving a console release alongside the Xbox Series X and S, trades cover-based third-person shooting for cover-based third-person tactics. Set before the events of the main series, you command Gabe Diaz (the father of Gears 5 protagonist Kate Diaz) and a small contingent of frighteningly muscular soldiers in XCOM-style tactical combat against foot soldiers of the Locust horde. Each unit falls under a different class, and each class has a robust skill tree, allowing you to customise your Gears’ talents beyond just “shoot real good and punch real hard.” Masochists will be thrilled to hear about a relentlessly punishing mode, Ironman, which prevents any back-tracking.

A Good Match For: Fans of chess or XCOM. Sentient protein shakes.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone seeking a third-person shooter; just go play the excellent Gears 5 instead, which has also been revamped for Xbox Series X and S.

Yakuza: Like A Dragon
Yakuza: Like a Dragon isn’t the best Yakuza game you can get. It is, however, maybe the best you can get on the Xbox Series X and S, since it’s the first to have been released with next-gen systems in mind, and is also the perfect place to start with the series if you’ve somehow never played one before and were put off by previous games’ reliance on real-time brawling. This one replaces that action gameplay with JRPG-style turn-based combat, which results in a far more chilled experience — or as chilled as kicking bikes into people’s faces before crushing them with a giant vibrator can be.

A Good Match For: Yakuza fans, Yakuza newcomers, and anyone in between.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection
What more is there to say? It’s Halo! We’re talking about the Xbox flagship. Halo: The Master Chief Collection compiles the mainline Halo games — Halo 1 through 4, plus add-ons for Reach and ODST — into one, tidy package, available on all Xbox consoles. But, for the Xbox Series X and S, The Master Chief Collection has been updated to allow for 4K resolution and heightened framerates. (As with Ori, those with compatible displays can run it at 120 fps, a massive boon for such a high-stakes shooter.) Multiplayer fans will be thrilled to hear that, right now, the community feels more alive than ever. You can queue up a match in seconds. You can drop into playlists for game types across multiple games, or curate matches to your liking, choosing individual Halos and modes piecemeal. (Team Slayer or nothing, folks.) The campaign, too, is better than ever, thanks to the visual enhancements. Make no mistake: Those notorious issues that plagued The Master Chief Collection in the past are but a distant memory.

A Good Match For: Fans of shooters new and old. Anyone who wants to catch up on Halo before the eventual release of Halo Infinite, planned for sometime between now and the Great Journey.

Not A Good Match For: Those looking to conserve storage space; The Master Chief Collection clocks in at more than 120GB. Anyone itching to play Halo 5: Guardians, as Spartan-117’s most recent outing isn’t part of the Collection.
