For a country that is besotted by cricket and where parents prefer to send children to academies in the hope that they at least make the grade in the IPL, gaming has still managed to hold its own, though largely on smartphones. While PC gaming is on a slow curve upwards, consoles are struggling to ignite some relevance. 

India is one of the top five mobile gaming markets of the world with approximately 300 million users, thanks to the cheap internet bandwidth and cheaper phones. It is into this milieu that PC games are seeking to get a toe-hold. 

Owning a PC solely focused on gaming is still a dream for many in India, the availability of affordable internet has helped in increasing awareness around online gaming. As per estimates, the gaming industry in India is likely to generate a revenue of Rs. 11,900 crores (around $1.6m/£1.2m/AU$2.2m) by 2023 and several brands have started to consider India a potential market.

While India has always been a hub of talented developers, designers and coders, game development has not been the most favoured idea. However, in the last few years, there are a few studios that have braved these challenges and have released their games. To support these brave pioneers, we’ve created a list of a few of the best Indian PC games right in time for the PC gaming week here on TechRadar.

1. Gamedev Beatdown
Planning to build your own game? Well, Gamedev Beatdown is a single-player hybrid 2D strategy game that makes you experience the struggles of a game developer in a gamified way. 

As a decision-maker, this brawler-type game takes you through the entire life cycle of a game like building your own game right from scratch, creating a team that has a right mix of developers and designers, strategize to solve real-time scenarios that are fabricated to highlight issues a game developer would face.

Coupled with decision-based incidents, Gamedev Beatdown has all the ingredients- a nasty colleague and a pokey investor who’ll make you think about how to efficiently spend the funds available at hand. In case of an argument over a certain topic with a colleague, you get to solve it via small combat, brawler or a card-based activity. Since the winner’s decision is accepted, you need to ensure that you win the activity to proceed with the game as per your choice.

Created by a couple of ex-EA employees, Gamedev Beatdown is already available to download on Steam as early access with new modes and content being introduced regularly, the final launch for PC as well as a mobile version is scheduled for the last quarter of the year.

2. Asura
A rogue-like game, Asura has been available since 2017. Ausra is a top-down game that is set in a fantasy world, and the players’ skill tree changes every time they die. This game is heavily inspired by Indian mythology, which can be easily established by the name itself, and has the gamer reincarnated as an Asura, or a demon, who with the help of powers fights against the “God-king” Hasirama.

The latest “Vengeance Expansion” adds more features and content to the game. It adds a Vengeance mode, basically an endless game where you’ll be fighting with the unending waves of invading God king’s army. One who can eliminate the most, stays on top of the leaderboard. Other additions are Mahasura difficulty, Chakra system, where games unlock new perks by defeating enemy bosses, Shamshan and more.

Asura is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and can be downloaded from Steam. The makers of Asura are already working on a new RPG game that again leverages Indian mythology and is known as Yodha. Though the game is still a year and a half away as of now and like Asura, Yodha also has an interesting storyline. You can check out its teaser on YouTube.

3. Miner’s Mettle
Miner’s Mettle is an interesting blend of artillery game and a real-time strategy game. Set in the future, this game takes you to a newly discovered yet uninhabitable planet that has a magical mineral known as Pentum. As a player, you not only fight with other factions who are trying to take control of the planet and its resources but also ensure that you come back to your base station alive with a sizable cache of the mineral.

On the base station, users can build new weapons that once fitted on to the artillery trains, gives you an edge against the opponents. As a gamer, you also need to find a perfect balance between loading new weapons onto the train or keeping it spacious enough to haul a bigger cache of minerals.

The game is both a single-player game and an online multiplayer game. While the game is available on Steam as early access the full version is slated to roll out in less than a year.

4. Raji
This is an action-adventure game where you play a young girl Raji. It's set in ancient India where Raji is on a mission to save her brother, Golu, from the demons and defeat the demon-king Mahabalasura. On her journey, Raji completes various tasks which help her get different weapons blessed by various Indian Gods.

These weapons come with special powers that help Raji save her only family member. As the story unfolds, Raji solves different puzzles that also unveils why Mahabalasura is eager to destroy the world. 

The game strategically uses various aspects of Indian mythology, like Mandala paintings, local music, temples, idols on the walls of these temples etc, with each of them carrying a unique logic, immersing the player in the intricacies of ancient Hindu mythology.

Raji, as a game itself, has had its journey. It got delayed due to a failed Kickstarter campaign, however, in 2018 it got an Unreal Dev Grant from Epic Games. One of the most awaited games, Raji is now available on Switch while the PC and console version is expected to come out on October 15.

5. The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands
The Bonfire is a unique game that has been out for some time. It's a survival and strategy game that helps the player build a settlement. It has five minute cycles of day and night where you build your settlement, manage your craft, gather resources and manage them during the day while at night combat with the monsters to save your settlement.

The player is aided by the visitors who help build the structures for the settlement. As a player, you need to manage the workforce that is available at your dispense and use them strategically maintaining the balance between various tasks.

The game comes across with a minimalistic design and does not distract the player by offering too many alerts/information, instead letting them make a decision based on their instincts. Even the controls are easy and blend well with the design.

Bonfire 1 has been out for approximately three years now and is available for Windows PCs and iOS devices. Its sequel, Bonfire 2: Uncharted Shores, which comes with a similar story line, has also been released recently in August.

6. Lovely Planet 2: April Skies
Lovely Planet 2 : April Skies is a first-person shooter game. With over five different worlds, each filled with unique experiences, this fast-paced game has over 100 levels of shooting various objects and baddies, while unravelling hidden secrets.

Unlike most other FPS games, Lovely Planet 2 : April Skies does not have dead bodies lying around you, no gunshots, no citizens or enemies running for their lives. The player does not need health packs to heal nor does it have any deadly weapons. The player is equipped with a home-made gun-type weapon that is used to “shoot” the enemies which are nothing but red blocks. 

The target of the player is to get through each level quickly with the enemies or obstacles in the form of red blocks trying to stop the players from getting through. If a player touches the blocks/obstacles they have to start the level all over again, hence the best way to get through is to shoot them. Since there is no violence or blood, this game can be enjoyed by players of all age groups.

The game is available for Windows and iOS. For PCs, it can be downloaded from Steam while the iOS version is available on iTunes.

7. Rainswept
Rainswept is a cinematic adventure mystery game that is based in a small town, and the player is a part of a sad story that involves grief, loss and a murder mystery. While the game does touch upon sensitive topics like child abuse and domestic abuse, however, as the story unravels it creates hope and uses the art of storytelling effectively.

Since this is a 2D game, the characters look a bit cartoon-like, though there is nothing childish about this murder mystery. Playing the protagonist, Detective Michael Stone, your task is to assist the local police in finding out the killer of a young couple in the Pineview town.

Dressed as a typical detective, Stone takes you through the streets of the town and interacts with various characters in a bid to solve the murder mystery. The gameplay also has emotional flashbacks, coupled with soundtracks that sets the mood, of how the now-dead couple met and the drama in their lives making this a game that's hard to forget.

Rainswept was first released in February 2019 and is available on Steam for PCs and App Store for iOS devices.

Bored of lockdown? Office not reopening for another month? 

Grumpy about the April vacation to Aruba you had planned? Have no fear; TechRadar is here with a guide to the best tools and games you can use on your PC to experience the outside world without actually having to, you know, go there.

1. Microsoft Flight Simulator
The excellent Microsoft Flight Simulator is our pick for the best PC game for virtual tourism. With a brand new game engine developed in-house by French studio Asobo that powers an AI-driven world, this game uses Microsoft’s own map data to model 3D geography, both natural and man-made, right down to cars and trees. This allows it to recreate the whole world. That means you can fly pretty much anywhere, and the cutting edge tech allows you to visit places and experience them in almost photo-realistic graphics.

It even utilises real-world meteorological information to replicate weather effects in real-time. If it’s raining outside your window and you fly over your house, it should be raining in the game too. We’re not exaggerating when we say that this really might be the greatest realistic flight sim ever made, so if you haven’t been able to take a vacation this year, you know what you have to do.

2. Findery
Findery uses both user-generated content tied to locations and a dedicated Google Maps-powered globe to make virtual exploration a cinch. If you enjoy travel writing, this is the perfect tool for you; users can upload their own stories and descriptions of locations they’ve been to or live in.

It’s available both in browsers and as an app for mobile devices, and is the ideal platform for planning your next post-lockdown adventure thanks to the helpful advice and recommendations from other users. Posts are geotagged with exact coordinates, and many users post guides on how best to experience their home countries. Go check it out!

 3. Watch Dogs 2 
A more modern take on a US city, and a more exciting game that the drab Chicago-set original, the Watch Dogs sequel throws players into a vibrant, bustling sandbox in the form of a near-future replica of San Francisco (and the surrounding Bay Area, including Silicon Valley).

A plethora of gadgets and hacking skills make this city your playground. We’d say that exploring San Fran this way is even more fun than in real life; after all, we can’t do parkour or hack the traffic lights to cause a pileup IRL. Not without being arrested, anyway.

 4. L.A. Noire 
The facial animation might not have aged perfectly (read: it aged badly), but this is still a faithful rendition of Los Angeles in the 40s, bringing all the key landmarks as well as expertly matching the clothing and vehicles of the time.

The neo-noir story ties into this world perfectly, a great example of how a setting can become a key character in its own right. Indeed, it’s the city of L.A. itself that ultimately deals a crucial killing blow - we won’t spoil it here, but those who have played will know exactly which death we’re talking about.

5. Google Earth
It’s a simple one, and we’ve all messed around on it at some point. But Google Earth is one of the tech giant’s greatest creations; an incredible, 3D-modelled recreation of our planet. Visiting natural landmarks in the comfort of your desk chair is great, and the tool runs incredibly well even in browsers.

StreetView integration means you can leap between the digitally recreated aerial view and photographs from the ground, so it just takes a few clicks to admire the view of the ocean from the old citadel of Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Red Dead Redemption 2

 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 
Oh, the western frontier. Red Dead Redemption 2 is so detailed, so well-executed, that you might as well have been sent back in time to the American west of 1899. This is a genuinely astounding gameworld teeming with life, from wild animals to outlaw shootouts and covert KKK meetings (which invariably end in those white-hooded fools meeting a grisly but comical end).

It looks mind-bogglingly good in motion, with both flora and fauna perfectly integrated into this already beautiful gameworld. It’s predecessor was a more barren environment to explore, but this is a lush wooded region with weather that reacts wonderfully as you move through it. If you haven’t played it yet, you’re missing out.

 7. Forza Horizon 4 
This might be the best gameworld we’ve ever seen in a realistic racing game. Well, we say ‘realistic’ - Forza Horizon 4’s open-world United Kingdom has been trimmed and adjusted to make it a better automotive playground, but it’s certainly still got that recognisably British atmosphere.

Seasonal weather effects make exploring locations like Edinburgh and the Lake District an absolute treat. It’s rare in a racing game to want to actually slow down and admire the scenery, especially when you’re behind the wheel of a supercar, but this Forza title simply has that power. Take your foot off the gas, and smell the roses.

8. Assassin’s Creed: Origins 
There are plenty of AC games that could potentially deserve a spot on this list, but we’re going to give it to Ubisoft’s gorgeous recreation of ancient Egypt. This is a fantastic world to explore, either on foot or riding a mount or boat, or scouting the area from the perspective of your trusty eagle, Senu.

The included photo mode is easy to use and lets you get up close and personal with some epic historic landmarks, so snap a shot and pretend that you’re actually atop the Pyramids of Giza (in real life, security would likely taze you before you got up the first row of steps)

9. Sleeping Dogs
Developer United Front put a lot of effort into making Sleeping Dogs’ crime-riddled mimicry of Hong Kong looks amazing. From recognisable landmarks to the splatterings of neon that illuminate the seedy backstreets, this is an urban environment that feels incredibly authentic. 

It’s not a perfect recreation, but it wisely tries more to capture the essence of HK than replicate the city street-for-street. 

During development, the sound team fought to retain Cantonese voice actors for background NPCs in different-language versions of the game, and we’re glad they did; the accents and dialogue you hear as you skim through the rainy streets on a battered motorbike add greatly to the immersion.

10. GeoGuessr
If you were in education within the last decade, you’ve probably already heard of GeoGuessr, one of the few ‘games’ to slip past the average school’s internet filter. It’s a simple enough premise: click start, and the game drops you onto its Google Maps-powered globe in StreetView mode, in an entirely random location.

From there, it’s up to you to figure out where in the world you are, using only clues from your immediate environment on the ground. That could be a street sign in a certain language, a monument, even a type of animal. GeoGuessr is best played with friends, in a race to see who can get un-lost first!

Gaming on mobile has been improving at a far greater rate than any technology that came before it. Android games seem to hit new heights every year. We see more and more premium game releases that challenge what phones can do and even free to play games are getting better and better.

These are the best of the best so the list won’t change all that often unless something excellent comes along. Also, the video above shows our list of the best Android games released in 2019 as well.

10 best NEW Android apps (updated monthly)
Call of Duty: Mobile
Price: Free to play

Call of Duty: Mobile is the latest game on this list. We usually wait a while before adding a game, but Call of Duty: Mobile is so intensely popular with such a high rating that we added it more quickly than usual. The game has both a normal FPS online PvP mode along with a 100-player battle royale. That puts it in a rare category where it does battle royale like PUBG Mobile, but also regular FPS PvP like Critical Ops or Modern Combat. There is a surprising amount of stuff to do. It is a free to play game, but most of the in-game purchases are cosmetic items. You can find some more excellent FPS games here or some general shooting games here if you want more options.

Genshin Impact
Price: Free to play

Genshin Impact is an action RPG game with gacha mechanics. It received wide critical acclaim upon its release for its impressive visuals and excellent game play. It looks and acts a bit like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but nobody seems to really mind. The game does have a party system and you summon new characters through a gacha system similar to other gachas. However, the visual elements, game play mechanics, and the completely open world (complete with glider) make the game feel a lot less restrictive than most in the genre. Unless the developer messes this one up, it should remain excellent for a long time. Of course, there are other excellent gacha games here if you want to see more.

GRID Autosport
Price: $9.99

GRID Autosport launched in 2019 and immediately became one of the best racing games for Android. The Riptide GP and Asphalt franchises are also quite good, but GRID Autosport hits almost all of the check marks. It’s a premium game with no in-app purchases or advertising. The game also boasts excellent graphics, excellent controls, hardware controller support, tons of content to play through, tons of cars to unlock, and a variety of racing styles. The game is a bit expensive and it’s missing some smaller things racing fanatics tend to like, but it’s otherwise one of the best racing experiences in the Play Store. You can find more great racing games (including the popular Asphalt series) here.

DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY!

GRIS
Price: $4.99

GRIS is an adventure game with puzzle-platformer elements. This is one of those ones you know is good just by looking at it. The game follows Gris, a young girl lost in her own world while dealing with the painful experiences in her life. It doesn’t have anything like player death or anything like that. You simply explore the world, solve some puzzles, and enjoy. The game features almost no text and chooses instead to tell its story through visual elements instead. It’s an artsy game, but one of the best in its genre. You can find more outstanding adventure games here.

DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY!

Legends of Runeterra
Price: Free to play

Legends of Runeterra is one of the newer Android games on this list. It’s an online battler similar in scope to games like Hearthstone. Players collect cards and heroes, then build decks from those cards and heroes. You then battle opponents online. The game removes as much of the randomness as it can and it leads to a good game play experience overall. The game includes 24 champions, a bunch of cards, and you can invite friends to duel with you as well. Hearthstone donned this list for a long time, but it’s time for a new champion in this space. You can find more great card dueling games here.

Levelhead
Price: $6.99

Levelhead is a new platformer from Butterscotch Shenanigans, the same developer of Crashlands. Crashlands was on this very list for a good two or three years, and we expect Levelhead to be here for a while too. It’s a platformer with 90 levels, surprisingly satisfying controls, and some excellent humor. However, this one sets itself apart from others with its truly excellent custom level building. Players can build levels and upload them to the game. Other players download them and the most popular end up in the game’s prestigious vault. Plus, the game has speed running features and each level comes with its own leaderboard (even the custom ones). Finally, the game is cross-platform with cloud saves. It covers all of the bases for a mobile platformer. It’s also free with Google Play Pass if you use that. This is easily the best in its class, but here are some other good platformers to try as well.

Minecraft
Price: $6.99 with in-app purchases

Minecraft is a popular game all around the world for people of all ages. For those who have never played, Minecraft puts you in a giant world where you mine stuff, build stuff, beat up bad guys, and do pretty much whatever you want. There is a survival mode where you must mine your own resources and food along with a creative mode that gives you unlimited everything. Frequent updates have added tons of new content and possibilities. The game is pretty much on par with its PC and console counterparts. In fact, you can play on multiplayer servers with people on those platforms. There are in-app purchases, but they’re just for customization things like skin packs. It’s not only the best sandbox game on Android, but also one of the best survival games as well.

Monument Valley 1 and 2
Price: $3.99 + $1.99 / $4.99

Monument Valley returns to the list with the release of Monument Valley 2. Both games are still very excellent. In fact, they both have virtually identical game play mechanics and graphics. The player adventures through Escher-style puzzles where levels are movable to complete the path using illusions. The premise is still charming and the Monument Valley franchise continues to stand as a couple of the best mobile games ever. The first one runs for $3.99 with an optional $1.99 in-app purchase for the Forgotten Shores DLC. The second game runs for $4.99 right now. You can play both games as part of the Google Play Pass if you subscribe to that. Here are some other great puzzle games as well if you want more options.

Nintendo games
Price: Free / Freemium / Varies

Nintendo has a decent number of Android games and they’re all pretty decent. They have one premium game with Super Mario Run. Many believed it to be too high of a price. However, mechanically, it’s one of the best platformers on mobile. Nintendo also has a couple of freemium options including Fire Emblem Heroes (strategy RPG) and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp (simulation). Nintendo added Dragalia Lost to its repertoire in September of 2018 as well as Dr. Mario World in 2019. Finally, Mario Kart Tour is the second biggest mobile game releases of all time, second only to Call of Duty: Mobile. Nintendo’s games can be a bit rough around the edges sometimes, but they all provide relatively fun and solid experiences.

Noodlecake Studios
Price: Free / Free to play / Varies

Noodlecake Studios is one of the most unique developers of Android games. Their titles are vast and varied. Some excellent titles from this studio include Framed 1 and 2 for puzzle games, Alto’s Adventure (and Alto’s Odyssey) for infinite runners, realMyst and its sequel for more hardcore puzzle fans, Wayward Souls for action-adventure fans, Island Delta for shooter fans, Mikey Shorts and Farm Punks for platform fans, and many more. We also really liked Lumino City for its uniqueness and Vignettes for its simplicity. The studio’s latest game is Summer Catchers, a side-scroller with some platformer elements. The games run the gamut from free to free to play and premium. We have a list of more great endless runner games on Android as well.

Pokemon GO
Price: Free to play

Pokemon GO exploded onto the mobile gaming scene in July 2016 and immediately became of the best Android games ever. It’s an augmented reality game similar to Ingress where you walk around the real world, catch Pokemon, complete little side missions, battle for Gyms, and hit up Pokestops to restock on items. It beat virtually every record in the books as the world’s most popular mobile game. Thanksfully, the game gets frequent updates with new features. Some more recent features include an AR camera mode, new Pokemon, and a bunch of other neat stuff. Niantic also launched Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, a Harry Potter AR game with similar mechanics. The two games stand alone atop the best augmented reality games on mobile.

PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite
Price: Free to play

PUBG Mobile hit the ground running upon its releases. It already has over ten million downloads and nearly a million user reviews. Thankfully, it’s actually a very competent mobile FPS. It features simple, effective controls, decent graphics. and a simple premise. Basically, 100 people drop from a plane onto an island and duke it out until only one is left standing. The island is littered with gear, weapons, and vehicles along with a mechanic that lowers the play area over time to keep matches from lasting too long. Recent updates added new game modes as well as a free to play element. PUBG Mobile Lite is a lighter version of the game with fewer players per match and lower graphical settings. It’s only available for some devices, though. Fornite is another excellent option, but you have to jump through some hoops to install it.. Of course, here are some other satisfying battle royale options as well.

Square Enix games
Price: Free / Free to play / Varies

Square Enix is one of the few “big name” developers that took mobile gaming seriously from the start and they have some of the best Android games available anywhere. Fans of jRPG games have remakes of Final Fantasy 1-7 and 9, seven Dragon Quest games, Chrono Trigger, and Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition to play and they’re all really good. You have Heavenstrike Rivals, Final Fantasy Tactics: WotL for tactical RPGs, Secret of Mana for an action RPG, and the Deus Ex series for strategy shooter enthusiasts. Even their freemium efforts, such as Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia are pretty good. Some recent titles from the studio (and its affiliates) include Romancing SaGa Re;univerSe, SINoALICE, and FFBE War of the Visions. Square Enix is arguably the champion of its genre, but you can find more great RPGs here.

Stardew Valley
Price: $7.99

Stardew Valley is easily one of the best premium games from 2019 and one of the best games overall. It’s a farming simulator with some RPG elements. You start out with a neglected farm and must rebuild it to its former glory. Players catch fish, grow crops, raise livestock, and interact with the various townspeople. You can even get married and have a family. The retro graphics helps keep things simple, but the game has dozens of hours of content. Plus, the controls are simple and most of the in-game interactions are charming and fun. It’s the best farming sim on mobile even if it’s not entirely realistic. It’s also free if you subscribe to Google Play Pass. Stardew Valley sits atop its genre, but there are more good farming simulators here if you want to see more.

The Room series (four games)
Price: $0.99-$4.99 each

The Room is a series of four puzzle games. It was the first franchise that did the puzzle genre really well on mobile. The latest game in The Room series is just as big of a hit as its predecessors and they remain among the best Android games. The Room is a series of escape puzzle games. Each room has bunch of mysterious objects. Your goal is to solve the puzzles and get out. You progress from room to room to find even more unique objects and solve their puzzles until you win the game. The latest one, The Room: Old Sins, includes cloud saving, Google Play Games achievements, and even a small exploration element. That sets it apart from the pure puzzle experience of the first three games. You can’t go wrong with any of these. They’re all very good. There are some other decent escape games here if you want to see more, but The Room is definitely the best one.
