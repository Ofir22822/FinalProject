CRY IT OUT from the rooftops: we survived 2018. (At least as of press time, so, y'know, probably.) And in this long, complicated year, a few games stuck out as the best, the most interesting, the most surprising, of the year. Whether you're catching up over the holidays or just looking for fuel to argue with your friends, here are our picks for the best videogames released in 2018. And yes, they're ranked. And no, your eyes aren't deceiving you: a certain Western-themed open-world game isn't in here. (Nor is Celeste, which honestly should have warranted making this a Top 11 list.) Games are a vast and varied field, friends; so are opinions. Argue away!

10. Monster Hunter World (Capcom, PC/PS4/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/7paWNhKkX38

Monster Hunter has, for a certain variety of player, been a big deal for years. The once-obscure franchise has garnered a cult following addicted to its obtuse but idiomatically playable rhythms of hunting monsters, crafting gear, and hunting tougher monsters. World takes those rhythms of play and expertly makes them accessible to a broader audience, one that might have an interest in Monster Hunter but never had the time and will to learn how to play it. Using all the power of the modern gen, Monster Hunter World strikes a perfect balance between being welcoming to new players while still being challenging and strange. Explore a vast island full of prehistoric wonders, learn them, and then fight them to the honorable death. [Original review; buy now]

9. Into the Breach (Subset, PC/Switch)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptYwMwxP7ho

Giant robots! Time travel! Horrible aliens! If Pacific Rim went into a VitaMix with that one time-travel arc of Heroes when that show was good, this would be the videogame smoothie that resulted. Travel back in time repeatedly to try to save humanity from a horde of alien bugs—building, and losing, dozens of small squads of mech pilots while you do so. This is the rare strategy game that sings because of just the right amount of story, a veneer of melancholy and grief over the repetition. You've let a lot of people die to get to this point. But this run? It's going to be different. It has to be different. [Original review; buy now]

8. Minit (Vlambeer, PC/PS4/Switch/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-_2rkFr5m0

What can a game accomplish in 60 seconds? Traditionally, not much—but Minit presents a strong argument to the contrary. Think a 2D Legend of Zelda game, only you die every minute. What this means is that everything in the game worth doing has been compressed into 60-second increments, a design conceit that grows beyond a gimmick and into something brilliant. Riffing on the original Legend of Zelda is a favorite hobby of gaming's commercial indie scene, and I usually have absolutely zero interest in it as a trend. But Minit brings something concise, and witty, and absolutely jovial to its deconstruction of the game that became a genre. Minit only asks for one minute of engagement at a time. But you're going to want to give it a lot more. [Original review; buy now]

7. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Nintendo/Bandai Namco, Switch)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnpmjTMI12c

This was something of an off year for the Nintendo Switch. Quality titles abounded, but first-party flagships were few and far between; the new Pokemon games this year didn't scratch that specific itch that Nintendo regularly crafts their games to scratch. That place of semi-nostalgic, simple wholesomeness. For that, the only game in town is really the multiplayer epic Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Far from a perfect entry in the series, it's still more playable than almost any other game released this year. Nintendo excels at building games that are just good, clean fun, and this is the best the company they put out this year. [Original review; buy now]

6. God of War (Santa Monica, PS4)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0u_kAWLJOA

Pre-Cyber Week Sale

SUBSCRIBE
The grimmer by far of the two PlayStation 4 exclusives on this list, God of War is a difficult game to anoint with cheerful superlatives—not because it doesn't deserve them, but because they don't really fit the mood. It is, after all, a game about a bad, violent man trying to raise a son only moderately less broken than he is. It's a game about butchering droves of monsters and supernatural warriors, for no other good reason than because they're standing in your way. It's a game about going too far and trying to dial it back, maybe just a little, maybe just until you can almost see something approaching decency. It's a great game. Just not exactly the sort you want to praise with a smile on your face. [Original review; buy now]

5. Hitman 2 (Io Interactive, PC/PS4/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4CgoNHgfe4

If I could take any game with me to a desert island, provided that island also had electricity and a compatible game console, it would probably be Hitman 2. Agent 47, the series star, is a murderous cipher in an infinite cycle of assassination and disguise, and this is his perfect outing. Io's latest refines the nontraditional stealth sandbox of earlier titles into a tightly wound, impossibly complex series of puzzle box levels that burst open with an explosive giggle. Sure, you can just run up and shoot your target before fleeing, but even if you survive, what fun is that? How about throwing them off a roof while dressed as a corporate mascot. Or pretending to be a tattoo artist and then taking them out when you're all alone. Hitman 2 rewards creativity and black humor, and it can be played pretty much forever. What a game. [Original review; buy now]

4. Donut County (Ben Esposito, PC/PS4/Switch/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWt1GPkfzkM

Donut County is not a long game, nor is it particularly complex. The puzzle premise, of sucking objects into a hole in the ground, never really gets more challenging than that, and the rhythms here are more those of a scenery showcase than a traditional puzzle game. But it's still a delight, bright and goofy, written with a shining wit and an effervescent joy. This is a comedy critique of capitalism disguised as a game about mischievous citygoing raccoons, and, like, honestly, I'm not sure what more you really want from your videogames. It ticks all of my boxes. I waited for this one for years, and it did not disappoint. [Original review; buy now]

3. Dead Cells (Motion Twin, PC/PS4/Switch/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvGaSPTcTxc

Dead Cells is an almost peerless action game. There, I said it. Within the framework of a simple roguelike structure—die, progress, die again, slowly eking your way toward an ultimate goal—Motion Twin has built one of the most satisfying 2D combat systems I've ever had the joy of getting my hands on. Every sword slash, bomb throw, and slammed door bristles with energy. The visual and auditory feedback, the speed, everything in this game's design is built to make the action absolutely soar. Dead Cells is a morbid, challenging game, which in 2018 isn't exactly a strong differentiating factor. But I've rarely, if ever, played a game that just feels so good. [Original review; buy now]

2. Dragon Ball FighterZ (Arc System Works, PC/PS4/Switch/Xbox One)
[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnyUyug0li8

Honestly, the only reason this didn't get my top spot is because fighting games are about as niche as they come. Still, this game is stunning. A distillation of everything that makes Dragon Ball one of the most influential and enjoyable pieces of Japanese comic media of all time, Dragon Ball FighterZ is also just one of the best fighting games ever. Responsive, surprisingly easy to learn, and predictably difficult to master, it turns the clear visual language of the anime it's based on into brilliant play. FighterZ (pronounced "fighters," to settle that bet) is also home to some of my favorite videogame moments of the year as a spectator. No other competitive game has such a fascinating sense of visual energy, or such clear mechanical drama. It absolutely slaps, is what I'm saying. Play it, watch it, pretend to be 13 again. [Buy now]

2018 was a conservative year in videogames. There were some gems, and a few exceptionally innovative titles in the indie scene, but nothing earth-shattering happened. No paradigms shifted this year. Expectations were rarely, if ever, subverted. Spider-Man likely wouldn't have made the top of a list like this in a bigger, stranger year. It's a conservative title, a triple-A open-world game in a world full of them. But don't let that fool you: even if Spider-Man is a game well suited to a quiet year, it's still an excellent game. It's pure comfort food in a year where even the best stuff rarely provoked that warm, happy feeling. Insomniac Games has crafted a title that adores its source material, that shapes its entire form around celebrating it. Spider-Man loves Spider-Man, and Spider-Man is a welcome, fun, bright presence in 2018. This is a quintessential Peter Parker adventure, perfectly translated into game form, and my impression of it has only grown more fond with time. One of my big litmus tests for games is if I find myself going back to it after I'm done covering it for work, and this was one of the few this year to pass. If you have a PlayStation 4, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. [Original review; buy now]

Risk and Reward
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a lot of things: It's gorgeous, challenging, an homage to one of FromSoftware's earliest games. But more than anything, it's a game of brutal beauty. Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, you take on the role of Wolf, a shinobi who cannot die. Well, you'll die a lot, actually—but you come back! This is a game built around the tension of confrontation. When do you draw your sword and when do you sneak past opponents? What do you do when you have no choice but to fight? These are the questions Sekiro seeks to answer.

Side Quests on Side Quests
The Outer Worlds
There’s some internal debate surrounding The Outer Worlds here at WIRED. If you play RPGs for the side quests, you’ll probably like it. If you run through the main story and ignore side quests as much as possible, you might find the game tedious. Either way, it’s a good pick for the RPG-obsessed gamers tired of replaying Skyrim—or getting online gameplay shoved down their throats (looking at you, Bethesda). Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the same team behind Fallout: New Vegas, the game is rife with riffs on capitalism, multifaceted companions, and a character arc that includes flaws as well as positive perks.

Colossal Classic
Shadow of the Colossus
Shadow of the Colossus is one of the best games ever made, and if you've never played it you owe it to yourself to check out this remastered version. Set in a barren, beautiful wasteland, SOTC makes drama out of minimalism, combining action-adventure gameplay with a series of breathtaking and harrowing boss encounters. Books have been written about how brilliant this game is, and the remaster renders it all in an enhanced graphical style. Purists may prefer the original, but if you've never played it, there's no good reason not to grab this one.

Fight for Your Friends
Kingdom Hearts III
WIRED's Julie Muncy said this game "feels like coming home." If you've been with the series since its inception in 2001, you owe it to yourself to give this one a play-through. Even if you aren't a hardcore Kingdom Hearts fan, you'll still have fun traversing the Disney-themed universe as beloved character Sora. You'll adventure with your friends and, more important, fight for them. As one might expect, the game can feel a bit childish at times, but for some people that's part of the magic.

Couch Co-Op
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is one of the most frantic, frenetic multiplayer co-op games around. Up to four players (no online play, sadly) work together to pilot and defend a circular spaceship from hordes of baddies. It's your job to explore the galaxy to rescue kidnapped "space-bunnies" and defeat the forces of "anti-love." It's a goofy story that fits with Spacetime's beautiful neon colors, but don't let the look fool you—this is a tough 2-D game. Your teamwork will be tested as you each run between stations to man the engine, shield, four guns, map, and special attack cannon.

Yakuza 0
Everybody expects Yakuza 0 to be a pulpy action game with slick beat-’em-up mechanics. What a lot of people don’t expect is its edge-of-your-seat noir plot, multilayered characters, and hilarious side quests. Yakuza 0’s story—broken up by back-alley fights with thugs—is one of the best in any action game ever made. In one moment, a sad turn of fate will bring you to tears. In the next, your character is browsing the video shop with a man in tighty-whities named Mr. Libido. It’s a roller coaster, but one you won’t want to get off.

Overwatch
Four years after release, Overwatch is still one of the most popular games to hit PS4. It even has a professional esports league built around it, and for good reason: It's a game that has managed to capture some of the character-based zaniness of something like Super Smash Bros. while adding in addictive team-based play. Every character has unique skills and weapons, and every match has a different goal, like capturing a flag or guiding a payload through a map to safety. Blizzard continually adds new characters, maps, and modes, making it as good a time as ever to jump in and be a hero.

City Sim
Cities: Skylines
EA's SimCity franchise has struggled in the last decade, and Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive thought the idea was worth another shot. Cities: Skylines plays almost exactly like SimCity, but with more realism. Skylines simulates things like traffic congestion and mass transit lines incredibly well, which is fun to watch, and occasionally maddening as mayor. Even though it's complex, it feels as natural to build cities on a controller as it does a mouse and keyboard, and that's impressive.

If you've ever wanted to fight a dinosaur with a giant sword made out of its own bones, you should give Monster Hunter: World a try. In the latest incarnation of this beloved series you are a Monster Hunter exploring the wild unknowns of the New World, hunting gigantic monsters for "research" ... and loot, of course! There are also cat-people who make you truly enormous platters of improbably large food before every expedition. Seriously. They even dance while they do it.

This is a game without weapon-toggling, shooting, or even running. In it, you walk around a lifelike British Village and try to figure out why all the people are gone. Clues are all around, and you can experience the story at your own pace, in your own way. Rapture isn't for every gamer, but according to our review, if you let it, it "may leave you a little different than when you found it."

Anime Adventures
Persona 5
Persona 5 is a uniquely bizarre game, and it's even weirder if you've never played a Persona game. In short, it's a Japanese RPG about a normal teenager and his abnormal life. Alongside taking part-time jobs and worrying about girls, you'll spend your time in the supernatural metaverse breaking into the psyches of dangerous criminals and changing their hearts with arcane magic and the help of a talking cat. You know, normal high school stuff. It's like playing your way through a quirky high school anime or manga series with the slick visuals to match.

God of War
This might be the dadliest game ever made. It's a story about Norse legends, grappling with a personal history of violence, and a father trying to raise a son. Admittedly, this game, with its scenes of intense violence, is not for everyone. But M-rating aside, you'll find a lush action game built with a surprising amount of heart in Sony Santa Monica's God of War.

Tetris Evolved
Lumines Remastered
Lumines got its start on the ill-fated PlayStation Portable and had a sequel on Vita. Those are two reasons you may not have played it, and if you haven't, you've missed out. Lumines Remastered comes from the developer behind cult classics Rez and Child of Eden. It plays like a clever twist on Tetris, demanding that you group like-colored blocks together in time for a line to come and erase them. Think of it as a classic game with a fresh coat of HD paint, all set to a groovy techno beat.

Horror Masterpiece
Resident Evil 2
The original Resident Evil 2 was the first survival horror game I (Jess Grey) ever played. I spent countless nights hunched over the controller, heart thundering in my chest. I think I cried the first time I saw the Licker (a skinless monster-man with claws for hands and a whip-like tongue) crawling across the ceiling at me. The modern remake is a loving re-creation of these delightfully horrifying moments, with updated visuals and gameplay. It's a head-to-toe remake of the game in the best way and a modern classic, whether you played the original or not.

What Remains of Edith Finch
What Remains of Edith Finch (WIRED review) is a bit like Gone Home. It's another game in which you walk around a creepy home and try to piece together a mystery. It's oddly chilling and more cinematic than some of its peers, offering unconventional flashbacks that act as mini games, letting you interact with the past in peculiar ways. If you haven't played a game like this, it's not a massive investment. You can plow through the story in a few hours, but try to take your time. You won't regret it.

Dungeon Defeater
Dead Cells
Roaring wildly out of the gates, Dead Cells is an infinite combustion engine, all energy, power, and motion. A roguelike game in the vein of Spelunky, it's one of the most accessible and entrancing titles in its genre. The premise is simple: Wake up in a prison cell as an undead warrior. Get a weapon. Get out. Keep going. Each death is another opportunity to delve deeper into the gnarled web of crypts, sewers, and rooftops that make up the prison colony you're trying to escape, and the path is thick with monstrosities and obstacles. There are a lot of action games that feel and look like Dead Cells. But few play like this.

Horizon Zero Dawn
Ever wondered what the world would be like if it was filled with robot animals? In Horizon Zero Dawn, you're a hunter and an outcast sneaking and fighting robotic creatures in a vast open world. It's an outstanding third-person adventure set in a post-apocalyptic world, and one of the best single-player PS4 exclusives. Even better, it's not a sequel to anything. It's a creation all its own by developer Guerilla Games—and if you own a PS4 Pro, it does a good job showcasing the upgraded system's graphical prowess.

The Last of Us looks like your typical postapocalyptic zombie game, and in some ways it is, but it's also deeper than that. It tells the story of a teenage girl who grew up in the ruins of the world and the man who takes her across the US to safety. It builds a world better than most games, and the remastered version comes with the Left Behind campaign that made waves a few years ago by shifting the game's focus to its female protagonist.

Bloodborne
A bloody weapon, an army of horrendous monsters, and one very bad night. Bloodborne is possibly the best game made in the vein of Dark Souls. It's a spiritual successor that takes what worked about the original—ultrahard combat, ingenious storytelling, atmosphere oozing out of all corners—and weds it with unspeakable cosmic horror. There's a little Lovecraft in here, a little Mary Shelley, and a little Bram Stoker. And a lot of genius.
