DAN STAPLETONLIKE FALLOUT 3 BEFORE IT, FALLOUT NEW VEGAS THROWS US INTO A HARSH, POST-NUCLEAR AMERICA. BUT IT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES SOMETHING GREATER THAN JUST MORE OF THE SAME THANKS TO SOME AMAZING WRITING AND TOUCHES BY SOME OF THE MINDS BEHIND THE ORIGINAL FALLOUT AND FALLOUT 2. IT’S NOT LIMITED TO MECHANICAL TWEAKS LIKE IMPROVED REAL-TIME COMBAT AND CRAFTING. SEVERAL FACTIONS WITH DEEP, SHADES-OF-GRAY CHARACTERS POPULATE THE WASTES WITH INTERESTING MORAL DECISIONS, MAKING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NEW CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC, CAESAR’S LEGION, AND THE MYSTERIOUS MR. HOUSE FEEL LIKE ANYTHING BUT A BLACK-AND-WHITE CHOICE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

THE FACT THAT WE GET TO DECIDE THE OUTCOME MAKES IT EVEN BETTER. AND AGAIN SOME AMAZING MODDING WORK BY THE COMMUNITY MAKE THE PC VERSION OF NEW VEGAS THE DEFINITIVE ONE.

DID YOU KNOW?
IT WAS DEVELOPED IN 18 MONTHS.
IT CONTAINS 65,000 LINES OF DIALOGUE, AS COMPARED TO 40,000 FOR FALLOUT 3.
PARTS OF NEW VEGAS, INCLUDING CAESAR'S LEGION, WERE TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL CANCELED VERSION OF FALLOUT 3, KNOWN AS VAN BUREN.

MEGHAN SULLIVAN FINAL FANTASY VI WAS A REVELATION FOR ME BACK IN THE MID ‘90S. IT’S DARK, STEAMPUNK-LADEN WORLD WAS LIKE NOTHING I’D EVER SEEN BEFORE, AND I LOVED HOW THE HEROES WERE MORE BROODING AND COMPLEX THAN THEIR CHEERY PREDECESSORS. THE MUSIC AFFECTED ME PROFOUNDLY AS WELL; SOME OF MY FAVORITE NOBUO UEMATSU PIECES (INCLUDING "DANCING MAD" AND "ARIA DI MEZZO CARATTERE") ARE FROM THE FINAL FANTASY VI SOUNDTRACK.

BUT WHAT REALLY SETS FINAL FANTASY VI APART FOR ME IS ITS MANY ICONIC MOMENTS: MAGITEK ARMOR MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH A SNOWY FIELD. CELES SINGING AT THE OPERA HOUSE. RUNNING INTO DEATHGAZE WHILE FLYING AROUND IN SETZER'S AIRSHIP. KEFKA DESTROYING THE WORLD AND BECOMING A GOD. THESE MOMENTS HAVE STAYED WITH ME FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

ALONG WITH ITS INCREDIBLE STORY AND SOUNDTRACK, FINAL FANTASY VI ALSO FEATURES A FANTASTIC COMBAT SYSTEM, WHICH INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO FREELY SWAP OUT PARTY MEMBERS BETWEEN BATTLES. (THERE ARE A WHOPPING 14 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS IN ALL.) THE TETRADECA OF HEROES ISN’T STACKED WITH USELESS FILLER CHARACTERS EITHER, SOMETHING I REMEMBER VERY MUCH APPRECIATING WHEN I WAS FACED WITH A TOUGH BOSS FIGHT AND NEEDED TO ADJUST MY STRATEGY. I ALSO LIKED SWITCHING OUT SPELLS AND ABILITIES USING MAGICITE, WHICH ALLOWS PLAYERS TO FREELY CUSTOMIZE CHARACTERS HOWEVER THEY SEE FIT.

FINAL FANTASY VI IS CONSIDERED A MILESTONE IN THE FINAL FANTASY SERIES, AND WITH GOOD REASON. IT’S UNIQUE COMBAT AND INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC STORY SETS IT APART FROM MOST GAMES OF ITS GENERATION. EVEN TODAY, I GET GOOSEBUMPS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. I LOVED FINAL FANTASY VI THEN, AND I LOVE IT NOW.

MIRANDA SANCHEZ WHERE MASS EFFECT SET THE STAGE A FUTURISTIC MILKY WAY, MASS EFFECT 2 LET YOU EXPLORE AND EXPERIENCE SO MUCH MORE OF IT. AS COMMANDER SHEPARD, I TRAVELED THE GALAXY ON THE BEST RECRUITMENT TRIP I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR, AND EXPERIENCED POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST HEART-WRENCHING STORIES – BUT WHETHER OR NOT THE GAME ENDS IN TEARS IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

AS YOU HEAD OUT FOR A SUICIDE MISSION, YOU’LL MEET SOME OF THE BEST-WRITTEN CHARACTERS THAT FEEL ORIGINAL AND HAVE THE POWER TO EVOKE TRUE EMOTIONS. PERHAPS ONE OF THE BEST PARTS ABOUT EARNING THE LOYALTY OF EACH OF THE COMPANIONS WAS DISCOVERING MORE ABOUT THEIR RESPECTIVE SPECIES AND SEEING HOW THEY’RE SURVIVING IN A VIOLENT GALAXY. MAXIMUM LOYALTY FOR MY COMPANIONS IN MASS EFFECT 2 WAS NOT AN OPTION; FOR MY HEART’S OWN GOOD, IT WAS A REQUIREMENT.

POKÉMON YELLOW TAKES ALL THE BEST ELEMENTS FROM POKÉMON RED AND BLUE AND UPGRADES IT TO MAKE IT FEEL MORE LIKE THE ANIME. THE BEST CHANGE TO THE ORIGINALS, OF COURSE, WAS A PIKACHU FOLLOWING YOU AROUND ON YOUR JOURNEY. SUDDENLY, THE POKÉMON WEREN’T JUST CREATURES YOU SUMMONED FOR BATTLE; THEY BECOME EMOTIONAL CREATURES THAT ACCOMPANY ON YOUR ADVENTURE. THEY’RE NO LONGER JUST FIGHTERS YOU BRING ALONG. THE SMALL STORY ELEMENTS THAT LINK POKÉMON YELLOW BACK TO THE ANIME WERE A FUN WAY TO LET THE PLAYER RELIVE THE BEGINNING OF ASH’S JOURNEY, BUT ULTIMATELY, POKÉMON YELLOW IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO EXPERIENCE THE POKÉMON UNIVERSE – IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

DID YOU KNOW?
POKÉMON YELLOW IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GAME AS POKÉMON RED, BLUE, AND GREEN, BUT IT INCLUDES ELEMENTS FROM THE ANIME.

BUT ITS AMBITIOUS STORY – OF RELIGIOUS AND SCIENTIFIC SCHISMS, OF DREAMS AND REALITY, OF IDIOT GODS AND NIGHTMARE NEWBORNS – IS TOLD NOT IN THE OVERWRITTEN PROSE FAVOURED BY LOVECRAFT BUT BY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SAVAGE THIRD-PERSON ACTION GAME.

SAM CLAIBORNWHEN METROID PRIME HIT THE GAMECUBE IT WAS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST, MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED GAMES ON ANY PLATFORM. IN A POST-WII ERA, IT'S HARD TO FATHOM NINTENDO EVER SHAKING UP THE INDUSTRY AGAIN WITH A CUTTING-EDGE, FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER, BUT THAT'S WHAT MADE 2002 SUCH AN EXCITING YEAR FOR GAMECUBE OWNERS.

I DIDN'T PLAY THE PREVIOUS METROID GAMES, SO I BOUGHT METROID PRIME JUST TO SEE WHAT MY GAMECUBE WAS CAPABLE OF – AND BECAUSE IGN GAVE IT A 9.8. IT WAS GORGEOUS AND FAST, BUT IT WAS ALSO AMAZINGLY PACKED WITH DETAIL: BIRDS, BUGS, AND OTHER WILDLIFE OCCUPIED THE RUINS OF THE GAME, WHILE HIEROGLYPHS AND ETCHINGS REVEALED ITS HISTORY.

METROID PRIME WAS ALSO A LONELY GAME. METROID PRIME DROPPED YOU INTO THE CHOZO RUINS WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO. EXPLORING AN ALIEN PLANET SOLO IS WHAT THE SERIES IS ALL ABOUT, AND WHY THE SUBSEQUENT GAMES WITH SPACE MARINES AND HUNTERS JUST DIDN'T WORK AS WELL.

JEREMY AZEVEDOTHERE ARE THREE RESIDENT EVIL GAMES IN OUR TOP 100 LIST, BUT RE4 IS BOTH THE HIGHEST-RANKED TITLE AND THE ONLY ONE THAT ISN’T A REMAKE. THAT’S BECAUSE CAPCOM GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME, WITH A PERFECT BLEND OF ATMOSPHERE, ACTION AND STORY THAT MADE US WANT TO PLAY THROUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN, THROUGH MULTIPLE RELEASES, ON EVERY PLATFORM UNTIL MY GIRLFRIEND WAS ALL LIKE “HEY, MAYBE IT’S ABOUT TIME THAT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT GETTING A JOB?” AND I WAS LIKE “UH, UNLOCKING THE HANDCANNON IS MY JOB NOW, HOWBOUTHAT?!”

NOT ONLY DID RE4 TOTALLY REDEFINE THE 3RD PERSON SHOOTER, BUT IT DID SO IN THE SEEMINGLY INCONGRUENT GENRE OF SURVIVAL HORROR. TURNS OUT, IT TOTALLY WORKED AND LED TO SOME INCREDIBLE SET PIECES BATTLING AGAINST CHAINSAW-WIELDING MANIACS, GIANT MEN, GIANT FISH, TINY MEN IN NAPOLEON COSTUMES, AND MEDIUM-SIZED CENTIPEDE MEN. RE4 UNLOCKED THE TRUE POTENTIAL OF THE SERIES IN A WAY THAT HASN’T BEEN MATCHED BEFORE OR SINCE, AND WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE THE MOST UNIVERSALLY BELOVED RESIDENT EVIL TITLE.

DID YOU KNOW?
HARDWARE MANUFACTURER NUBY TECH CREATED AN OFFICIAL RE4 CUSTOM CONTROLLER SHAPED LIKE A CHAINSAW. IT WAS INCREDIBLY CUMBERSOME AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY THE GAME WITH (ESPECIALLY IF YOU WERE USED TO PLAYING THE GAME WITH A WII-MOTE), BUT THEY LOOK COOL AS HELL.
IF YOU TRY TO MAKE LEON LOOK UP ASHLEY GRAHAM'S SKIRT, SHE WILL CALL YOU A PERVERT, AND SHE WILL BE RIGHT YA LITTLE FREAK, YOU!
THERE WAS A VERSION OF RESIDENT EVIL 4 IN DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THE ONE WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE THAT WAS VERY SUPERNATURAL AND EVEN MORE ACTION-HEAVY THAN WHAT WE FINALLY ENDED UP WITH. THAT VERSION OF THE GAME EVENTUALLY MADE IT INTO OUR HANDS AS WELL, ONLY IT DID SO AS 'DEVIL MAY CRY'.

ZACH RYANFEW GAMES HAVE EVER INSPIRED THE SAME SENSE OF AWE THAT SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS DOES WITHIN ITS FIRST 10 MINUTES. CLIMBING THAT FIRST LEDGE AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THE FIRST COLOSSUS IS AMONG THE MOST IMPACTFUL, AND ALMOST TERRIFYING, EXPERIENCES IN ALL OF GAMING. FROM ITS BEAUTIFUL, CRUMBLING RUINS TO THE HULKING, ANCIENT COLOSSI, FUMITO UEDA’S SUN-SOAKED ACTION/ADVENTURE GAME IS DRENCHED IN A MUTED, MELANCHOLY AESTHETIC THAT HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH HIS, ADMITTEDLY LIMITED, WORKS.

AT ITS CORE, SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS IS REALLY A PUZZLE GAME. ONCE YOU’VE MANAGED TO RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK OF STUMBLING ACROSS EACH OF THE COLOSSI, YOU’LL NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO SCALE, AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY EACH MONSTER. EACH OF THESE HARROWING ENCOUNTERS WILL NOT ONLY LEAVE YOU SWEATY, BUT REVEAL JUST THE TINIEST BIT MORE ABOUT THE VAGUE, MOURNFUL PLOT THAT MAIN CHARACTER WANDER HAS MANAGED TO FIND HIMSELF IN. PART LOVE STORY, PART MONSTER HUNT, PART PARABLE, SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS BORROWS HEAVILY FROM WHAT CAME BEFORE, BUT INSPIRES MUCH OF WHAT CAME AFTER.

SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS WAS A SPIRITUAL SEQUEL TO FUMITO UEDA'S FIRST GAME, ICO.

MAX SCOVILLETHOUGH THERE'D ALREADY BEEN TWO OFFICIAL ENTRIES IN THE METAL GEAR SERIES (NOT COUNTING SNAKE'S REVENGE, WHICH WE DON'T TALK ABOUT) IT WASN'T UNTIL SNAKE COVERTLY SLITHERED HIS WAY ONTO THE PLAYSTATION THAT THIS FRANCHISE CEMENTED ITSELF AS A BIG DEAL. THOUGH OFTEN LAUDED FOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE "STEALTH" GENRE, IT WAS BILLED AS A "TACTICAL ESPIONAGE ACTION" GAME. THE MOMENT-TO-MOMENT GAMEPLAY WAS ABOUT BEING SNEAKY, AND PLAYERS WERE REWARDED FOR OUTSMARTING THE DEFENSES OF SHADOW MOSES QUIETLY AND CLEVERLY, BUT THINGS FREQUENTLY GOT LOUD DURING ICONIC BOSS FIGHTS AND OVER-THE-TOP ACTION SETPIECES.

HOWEVER, WHERE METAL GEAR SOLID WAS TRULY GROUNDBREAKING WAS ITS EMPHASIS ON NARRATIVE AND CINEMATIC PRESENTATION. HIDEO KOJIMA'S LOVE OF HOLLYWOOD ACTION MOVIES WAS READILY APPARENT THROUGH SLICK CUTSCENES, AND YOJI SHINKAWA'S CHARACTER AND MECHANICAL DESIGNS ADDED A HEAVY DOSE OF ANIME SENSIBILITY, AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE SOUNDED AMAZING THANKS TO THE MUSICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF HARRY GREGSON WILLIAMS AND A STELLAR VOICE CAST INCLUDING CAM CLARKE, JENNIFER HALE, AND *OF COURSE* DAVID HAYTER. METAL GEAR SOLID LOOKED LIKE A MOVIE, SOUNDED LIKE A MOVIE, AND FELT LIKE A MOVIE, BUT STILL PLAYED LIKE A VIDEO GAME, STRIKING A DELICATE BALANCE THAT THE MEDIUM IS STILL STRIVING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS LATER.

JOE SKREBELSFOR ALL ITS INTER-DIMENSIONAL THREATS, MONSTER HUNTS AND MAGIC POWERS, I’VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE WITCHER 3’S KEY ACHIEVEMENT IS IN HOW IT NAILS THE MUNDANE. GERALT’S FANTASY WORLD IS ONE OF MUD, THATCH AND METAL, HIS MAIN QUESTS ARE FREELANCE WORK, AND HE LOVES A GAME OF CARDS DOWN THE PUB. THAT SENSE OF REALITY IS WHAT HELPS YOU EMPATHISE WITH GERALT, UNDERSTAND THE WORLD, AND REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WHEN THE CRAZY SHIT STARTS POPPING OFF.

AN RPG WITH ENOUGH COMPLEXITY TO SATISFY THE URGE TO TINKER, BUT ENOUGH CHARACTER NEVER TO FEEL IMPERSONAL, WILD HUNT IS A STAGGERING ACHIEVEMENT NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. ITS STORY DEFTLY BALANCES COSMIC THREAT AND FAMILY DRAMA, ITS CHOICES FEEL TRULY MEANINGFUL AND WORLD-CHANGINGLY EFFECTIVE, AND IT LOOKS GORGEOUS IN ITS OWN GRUBBY WAY. EVEN ITS TWO DLC EXPANSIONS ARE AMONG THE BEST EVER RELEASED. GERALT’S FINAL JOURNEY MIGHT BE BUILT ON THE MUNDANE, BUT THAT MAKES IT NOTHING SHORT OF MAGICAL.

JONATHON DORNBUSHBIOSHOCK WILL LIKELY ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR ITS GAME-CHANGING “WOULD YOU KINDLY?” TWIST, BUT THE FIRST ADVENTURE IN RAPTURE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN A DRESSED-UP DUPE. FROM FIRST ENCOUNTERING A SPLICER CARING FOR A GUN THE WAY A MOTHER CARES FOR HER BABY TO THE STILL-ENRAPTURING ANDREW RYAN TWIST TOWARD THE GAME’S END, BIOSHOCK DELIVERS ONE ENRAPTURING SETPIECE AFTER ANOTHER. THAT’S LARGELY IN PART THANKS TO ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE LOCATIONS IN GAMING HISTORY. SO MUCH STORY IS EMBEDDED IN THE DILAPIDATED HALLWAYS AND SHUTTERED ROOMS OF RAPTURE, A DECAYING UNDERWATER LABYRINTH THAT DEMANDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. THE MARK OF A GOOD EXPERIENCE IS ONE THAT YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT LONG AFTER YOU’VE FINISHED IT. AND I STILL HAVEN’T STOPPED THINKING ABOUT BIOSHOCK, ITS INCREDIBLE LOCATION, AND THOSE AWESOME PLASMIDS, OVER A DECADE LATER.

THE CHANGES IT MAKES ARE SWEEPING: IT ADDS CORPORATIONS, WHICH ADD ANOTHER RELIGION-LIKE LAYER, FLESHES OUT THE ESPIONAGE SYSTEM AND VICTORY CONDITIONS, AND ENHANCES THE AI TO PUT UP A GREAT FIGHT.

MEANWHILE, RANDOM EVENTS RANGING FROM TORNADOES TO BABY BOOMS MAKE EVERY PLAYTHROUGH EVEN MORE UNIQUE AND EVENTFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. AND WE REMIND YOU, THAT’S ON TOP OF A GAME THAT’S SO ADDICTIVE TO BEGIN WITH THAT IT’S COST US COUNTLESS NIGHTS OF SLEEP WHILST CHANTING ITS “JUST ONE MORE TURN” MANTRA OR HUMMING ITS GRAMMY AWARD-WINNING THEME SONG.

ZACH RYANTHERE'S NOT A TON LEFT THAT WE CAN REALLY SAY ABOUT THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME OUTSIDE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S INDISPUTABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE. NOT ONLY DID IT REDEFINE ACTION/ADVENTURE GAMES, BUT IT COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY THE INDUSTRY THOUGHT ABOUT 3D COMBAT AND EXPLORATION.

THE SEVEN-YEAR GAP BETWEEN A LINK TO THE PAST AND OCARINA OF TIME SAW ZELDA FANS EAGERLY ANTICIPATING LINK’S NEXT ADVENTURE, AND THEY WEREN’T DISAPPOINTED. GARNERING NEARLY UNANIMOUS CRITICAL PRAISE AND FAN ADORATION, OCARINA OF TIME WAS QUICKLY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND GROUNDBREAKING GAMES OF ALL TIME, AND FOR GOOD REASON. A SWEEPING, EPIC TALE THAT INTRODUCED NEW CHARACTERS, NEW LORE, AND AN EVER-EXPANDING TIMELINE THEORY, THIS VERSION OF ZELDA TOOK WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT ITS PREDECESSORS AND EXPANDED ON THOSE THEMES AND IDEAS EXPONENTIALLY.

SOLVING PUZZLE ACROSS TIME, RIDING EPONA THROUGH THE VAST EXPANSE OF HYRULE, AND THE FINAL CONFRONTATION WITH GANON ARE MOMENTS THAT WILL STICK WITH ZELDA FANS FOREVER, BUT IN 1998 THEY WERE MIND-BENDING, GENRE-DEFINING, AND MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EARN THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME A SPOT ON OUR TOP 100 LIST.

AN EPIC GAMING MOMENT MANY PEOPLE HAVE REFLECTED ON IS WHAT THEY CALL, “THE FIRST NIGHT IN MINECRAFT.” THE WORLD ALWAYS BEGINS AS A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY, AND YOU USE THIS TIME TO CHOP DOWN TREES, DIG, AND MAYBE EVEN SLAY A FEW ANIMALS FOR FOOD. IT’S GREAT, UNTIL THE SUN STARTS TO SET AND THE ACTUAL ENEMIES START TO APPEAR. IT’S AT THIS POINT YOU REALIZE THIS IS ACTUALLY A SURVIVAL GAME, AND YOU’RE FORCED TO EITHER BURROW UNDERGROUND OR MAKE A QUICK MAKESHIFT WOOD CABIN. THEN AS THE SUN RISES AND YOU WATCH ALL THE ENEMIES BURN TO A CRISP, YOU ARE FINALLY FREE TO EXPLORE AGAIN, YOU ARE HIT WITH A JOYOUS URGE TO EXPLORE AND DIVE EVEN DEEPER INTO THE GAME. WILL YOU KEEP YOUR FIRST HOUSE, OR SEARCH FOR A BETTER LANDSCAPE? WILL YOU BECOME AN UNGROUND DWELLER, OR LIVE ATOP A MOUNTAIN? THESE ARE THE FREEDOMS MINECRAFT OFFERS, AND THE ONLY THING THAT’S STANDING IN BETWEEN YOU AND LITERALLY ANYTHING, IS IMAGINATION.

DAN STAPLETONWHEN HALF-LIFE FIRST CAME OUT IN 1998, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS HOW TRANSFORMATIVE A GAME IT WAS. VALVE NOT ONLY PROVED IT WAS POSSIBLE TO TELL A REAL, ATMOSPHERIC STORY FROM WITHIN A FIRST-PERSON-SHOOTER, BUT DID IT SO BRILLIANTLY THAT ITS LESSONS HAVE INFORMED VIRTUALLY EVERY SHOOTER CAMPAIGN SINCE.

STEPPING INTO THE BLACK MESA RESEARCH FACILITY AS MILD-MANNERED GORDON FREEMAN AND BEARING WITNESS TO THE ACCIDENT THAT SETS OFF AN INTERDIMENSIONAL INVASION IS A MASTER CLASS IN INTRODUCING A GAME’S UNIVERSE. INSTEAD OF STOPPING THE ACTION AND PLAYING A CUTSCENE TO ADVANCE THE STORY, HALF-LIFE’S TALE ALL PLAYS OUT FROM GORDON’S PERSPECTIVE, NEVER TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM US, BUT DIRECTING OUR EYES TOWARD ITS SCRIPTED EVENTS. THAT TECHNIQUE WAS SURPRISINGLY EFFECTIVE AT MAKING ME FEEL LIKE GORDON AND I WERE ONE IN THE SAME.

ICONIC MONSTERS – MOST NOTABLY THE ALIEN FACEHUGGER-LIKE HEADCRABS THAT TRANSFORM SCIENTISTS INTO GRUESOME ZOMBIES – AND IMPRESSIVE SOLDIER AI GAVE HALF-LIFE A SPOOKY ATMOSPHERE BACKED UP BY ENEMIES THAT POSE A REAL THREAT. GREAT AND MEMORABLE WEAPONS, FROM THE SIMPLE CROWBAR TO THE SILENT SNIPER CROSSBOW AND THE BIOLOGICAL HOMING WEAPON THAT SHOOTS ALIEN BEES, MADE FIGHTING THROUGH THE SPOOKY RUINS OF BLACK MESA A FANTASTIC BATTLE.

DID YOU KNOW?
HALF-LIFE WAS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY STEPHEN KING'S THE MIST, WHICH IS ALSO ABOUT INTERDIMENSIONAL ALIENS.
VALVE FULLY SUPPORTS THE 2012 FAN-CREATED REMAKE, BLACK MESA, WHICH FEATURES UPDATED GRAPHICS, CHARACTER MODELS, AND VOICES.

CHLOI RADTHERE’S A REASON A SNAKE’S SKELETON, AND NOT A SNAKE ITSELF, FEATURES PROMINENTLY IN THE TITLE SEQUENCE OF SNAKE EATER. THIS WAS THE GAME THAT STRIPPED THE METAL GEAR FORMULA DOWN TO ITS VERY CORE AND PROVED THAT IT COULD STILL FUNCTION EVEN OUTSIDE OUR EXPECTATIONS. IT FORCED US TO TAKE WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT ESPIONAGE AND INFILTRATION AND LEARN HOW TO APPLY IT IN A NEW, UNFAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT, AND IT DID SO WITH A BOLD AND ELEGANT UNDERSTANDING OF ITS OWN SYSTEMS. YOU COULD HAVE ALL THE STEALTH KNOW-HOW AND MILITARY TRAINING IN THE WORLD, BUT OUT THERE IN THE UNPREDICTABLE JUNGLE OF THE RUSSIAN WILDERNESS, YOU WERE EXPOSED, VULNERABLE… A NAKED SNAKE. AND IT WORKED.

THIS WEIRD SHIFT IN TONE, STRUCTURE – IT ALL WORKED BEAUTIFULLY, AND WITH A POETIC EDGE THAT IS UNRIVALED IN OTHER METAL GEAR INSTALLMENTS. SNAKE EATER IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING LOVE STORIES EVER TOLD IN A GAME, ONE OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXCITING COLD WAR-ERA ADVENTURES, AND ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES TO TRULY MAKE ME REFLECT ON MY ACTIONS AS A PLAYER. IT MANAGES TO BE TRAGIC, SOMETIMES DEVASTATINGLY SO, AND YET STILL MAINTAIN THAT ABSURD COMEDIC FLAIR THAT I ADMIRE ABOUT THIS SERIES.

ANY GAME THAT CAN MAKE YOU EMOTIONAL ABOUT CLIMBING A LADDER DESERVES SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION.

I KNEW I WAS IN FOR SOMETHING SO NARRATIVELY SPECIAL FROM NAUGHTY DOG. THE SECOND MOMENT SOLIDIFIED THAT, AS, LATE INTO THE GAME, IT DEMANDED I MAKE A CERTAIN GAMEPLAY CHOICE BECAUSE THAT’S HOW JOEL WOULD ACT, EVEN IF IT WASN’T WHAT I WANTED TO DO. THAT DISSONANCE STRUCK ME, BUT MADE SO MUCH SENSE. THIS WAS JOEL AND ELLIE’S STORY I WAS EXPERIENCING, AND THOSE CHARACTERS FEEL SO REAL THANKS TO THE SCRIPT, ANIMATION, AND TROY BAKER AND ASHLEY JOHNSON’S STELLAR PERFORMANCES. THE LAST OF US MARRIES ITS STORYTELLING WITH ITS GAMEPLAY, AND NOTHING MADE ME FEEL MORE THAN THAT LAST MOMENT. THE GAME’S FINAL DISCUSSION BETWEEN ITS TWO PROTAGONISTS THAT IS FILLED WITH SO MUCH EMOTIONAL WEIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPERIENCE – BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED – THAT IT’S DIFFICULT TO THINK OF ANOTHER ENDING SO PERFECTLY TRUE TO THIS UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE.

RYAN MCCAFFREYDOOM CHANGED MY LIFE. MY GAMING LIFE, AT LEAST. HAVING SPENT MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE UP TO THAT POINT PLAYING PLATFORMERS, SIDE-SCROLLING ACTION GAMES, ETC. ON 8- AND 16-BIT CONSOLES, DOOM'S FIRST-PERSON SHOOTING WAS A JAW-DROPPING PARADIGM SHIFT.

EVERYTHING ABOUT DOOM WAS INCREDIBLE. THE GRAPHICS WERE COLORFUL AND CONVINCING. LIGHTNING WAS SPOOKY. IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE ON A MARTIAN MOON. IT'S MUSIC WAS MEMORABLE. WEAPON DESIGN WAS BRILLIANT, AND ENEMY DESIGN EVEN MORE SO. FROM THE IMPS TO THE CACODEMONS TO THE CYBERDEMON, NEARLY EVERY CREATURE IN DOOM WAS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES – AND IN A THEN-UNHEARD-OF GAMEPLAY TWIST, THEY HATED EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS THEY HATED YOU.

AND THEN THERE WAS DEATHMATCH. WHETHER YOU WERE CONNECTING TWO PCS WITH A SERIAL CABLE FOR ONE-ON-ONE ACTION OR THROWING A LAN PARTY WHERE FOUR PEOPLE HAULED THEIR PCS TO THE SAME PLACE (BULKY CRT MONITORS AND ALL!)

ZACH RYANCHRONO TRIGGER IS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE GREATEST RPG OF ALL TIME, AND FOR GOOD REASON. WHAT BEGINS AS A TYPICAL “DAY-IN-THE-LIFE” ADVENTURE, QUICKLY SPIRALS INTO A SPRAWLING, EPOCH JUMPING ROMP THAT IS EQUALLY EXHILARATING AND ENDEARING. CREATED BY A “DREAM TEAM” AT SQUARESOFT INCLUDING FINAL FANTASY CREATOR HIRONOBU SAKAGUCHI, DRAGON QUEST CREATOR YUJI HORII, AND CHARACTER DESIGNS BY DRAGON BALL CREATOR AKIRA TORIYAMA, CHRONO TRIGGER’S PEDIGREE WAS ONLY OUTSHINED BY ITS UNIVERSAL PRAISE UPON ITS RELEASE IN THE SPRING OF 1995. EVEN AT THE TWILIGHT OF THE SNES’ LIFESPAN, CHRONO TRIGGER’S BRANCHING NARRATIVE, COLORFUL CHARACTERS AND UNFORGETTABLE SOUNDTRACK WERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EARN IT A PLACE ON OUR LIST IN THIS TIMELINE OR ANY OTHER.
