JONATHON DORNBUSHTHERE'S A REASON FIRST-PERSON PUZZLE GAMES FAR AND WIDE ARE CONSTANTLY COMPARED TO PORTAL — THOUGH A BRIEF ADVENTURE, ITS GAMEPLAY, TONE, WRITING, AND STRUCTURE SO COHESIVELY WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE, CHALLENGING, AND FASCINATING PUZZLE GAMES AROUND. ARMING PLAYERS WITH THE NOW-ICONIC PORTAL GUN AND THE DEVASTATING - AND LETHAL - WIT OF GLAD0S, VALVE GUIDED PLAYERS THROUGH A FANTASTICALLY ORCHESTRATED AND ESCALATING SET OF PHYSICS-BASED PUZZLES. LEARNING TO USE THE SEEMINGLY SIMPLE PORTAL GUN IN INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX, ALL CULMINATING IN PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE END-CREDITS SONGS OF ALL TIME.

BUT FOR AS GREAT AS ITS PUZZLES ARE, AND THE WAY THEY TAKE THE SIMPLICITY OF TWO PORTALS YOU CAN SHOOT ALMOST ANYWHERE INTO SUCH FASCINATING TERRITORY, IT'S ALSO PORTAL'S WORLD-BUILDING THAT EQUALLY MAKES THE GAME SUCH A MEMORABLE TOUCHSTONE. FROM SECRETS AND SCRAWLINGS HIDDEN WITHIN THE WALLS OF PORTAL'S TESTING FACILITY, TO THE WAY IT SLOWLY UNCOVERS THE MYSTERY OF WHO GLAD0S IS OFFERS ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING AT SOME OF ITS FINEST. PLAYERS LEARN JUST ENOUGH TO PAINT A VIVID PICTURE WHILE VALVE LEAVES ENOUGH BLANK SPACE IN ITS STORY TO LET THE PLAYER FILL IN THEIR OWN DETAILS. THE CAKE MAY BE A LIE, BUT IT'S NOT A LIE TO TELL YOU TO PLAY PORTAL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.

DARK SOULS

DANIEL KRUPATHE MOST BORING THING TO NOTE ABOUT DARK SOULS IS ITS DIFFICULTY. WHY? BECAUSE IT STOPS YOU FROM FOCUSING ON ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT THE MOST INFLUENTIAL GAME OF THE LAST DECADE.

YOU FAIL TO MENTION HOW INCREDIBLE LORDRAN IS – A SINGLE CONTINUOUS LOCATION THAT SPIRALS FROM LAVA-FLOODED RUINS TO A GLISTENING CITY OF THE GODS. A PLACE WHERE NEW PATHS OFTEN LEAD BACK TO FAMILIAR LOCATIONS, SO THAT EXPLORING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FEELS LIKE SOLVING A PUZZLE. YOU OVERLOOK ITS PRECISE, NUANCED COMBAT OR THE FACT IT HAS THE MOST INTERESTING AND MEANINGFUL BOSSES OF ANY GAME. AND YOU CERTAINLY NEVER GET ROUND TO DISCUSSING ITS STORY, WHICH REVELS IN AMBIGUITY AND INVITES INTERPRETATION LIKE NO OTHER.

YES, DARK SOULS IS CHALLENGING, BUT THE REWARDS IT YIELDS TO THE PERSISTENT AND CURIOUS ARE LIMITLESS.

DID YOU KNOW?
DARK SOULS IS CONSIDERED A SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR TO DEMON'S SOULS, WHICH IS A SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR TO FROMSOFTWARE'S FIRST GAME, KING'S FIELD.
THE SERIES BEARS SEVERAL STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO THE MANGA BERSERK, A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON DIRECTOR HIDETAKA MIYAZAKI.
EARLY IDEAS FOR A TITLE WERE "DARK RACE" AND "DARK RING," BUT BOTH WERE SCRAPPED DUE TO CONTROVERSIAL CONNOTATIONS OVERSEAS.

CHRISTIAN HOLTWHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THE DEFINITIVE FIGHTING GAME, THE GAME THAT HAS SPAWNED COUNTLESS IMITATORS, ACOLYTES, AND SEQUELS? STREET FIGHTER II REMAINS A CLASSIC IN VIDEO GAME LORE, MAKING SERIES MAINSTAYS RYU, KEN, AND CHUN-LI AS WELL AS WORDS LIKE “HADOUKEN” PART OF THE PUBLIC LEXICON. EVERYONE HAS A FAVORITE CHARACTER AND THAT’S BECAUSE OF ITS DIVERSE, FANTASTICAL CHARACTER DESIGN.

IT’S HARD TO FATHOM HOW EXCEPTIONAL STREET FIGHTER II WAS AT ITS TIME. WHILE EXCEPTIONALLY BALANCED, THE IMAGINATIVE DESIGN AND HIGH-END GRAPHICS FOR ITS TIME HELPED SET IT APART. STREET FIGHTER II BECAME PERHAPS THE FIRST FIGHTING GAME GLOBAL ARCADE SMASH. OVER THE YEARS, CAPCOM KEPT UPDATING AND REFINING THE COMBAT, ALLOWING PLAYERS TO PLAY AS MORE CHARACTERS, SPEED UP THE COMBAT, AND SEE NEW SPECIAL MOVES FOR THEIR FAVORITE CHARACTERS. ITS PORTS KEPT GETTING NOMINATED FOR AWARDS YEARS AFTER ITS INITIAL 1991 RELEASE. THAT’S HOW ENDURING AND EXCEPTIONAL STREET FIGHTER II REMAINS.

DID YOU KNOW?
STREET FIGHTER II WAS THE FIRST GAME ON THE SUPER NES TO FEATURE 16 MEGABITS OF MEMORY.
THE SPECIAL MOVES PRINTED IN THE STREET FIGHTER II MANUAL FOR COMMODORE 64 WERE INCORRECT.
IT WAS PORTED TO NEARLY EVERY PLATFORM IN EXISTENCE AT THE TIME OF ITS INITIAL RELEASE.

RYAN MCCAFFREYFOR MANY GAMERS OF A CERTAIN AGE (AND NOW, THANKS TO THE NES CLASSIC, THE CHILDREN OF SAME PEOPLE), SUPER MARIO BROS. WAS THE FIRST VIDEO GAME THEY EVER PLAYED. MARIO'S MOVE OUT OF ARCADES, AWAY FROM DONKEY KONG, AND INTO THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM CHANGED OUR HOBBY AND OUR INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW IT, SETTING OF A CHAIN OF EVENTS (NINTENDO'S RISE FROM THE GAME INDUSTRY CRASH'S ASHES, THE POPULARIZATION OF THE PLATFORMER GENRE, ETC.) THAT SHAPED GAMING AS WE KNOW IT TODAY.

SUPER MARIO BROS. HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED MANY TIMES, BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TOO MANY TIMES BECAUSE IT'S STILL FUN AND IT'S STILL SOME KID'S FIRST TIME EVER PLAYING A GAME. SUPER MARIO BROS. SPAWNED AN INDUSTRY AND FUELED A MUSHROOM-POWERED EMPIRE. ITS INFLUENCE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. EXAMPLE: LITERALLY EVERYONE READING THIS CAN HUM ITS THEME SONG, RIGHT NOW, FROM MEMORY. SEE? NOW IT'S PLAYING IN YOUR HEAD AGAIN. YOU'RE WELCOME.

DID YOU KNOW?
SUPER MARIO BROS. ESTABLISHED NINTENDO'S HOME CONSOLE DOMINANCE IN AMERICA AND JAPAN.
SHIGERU MIYAMOTO WANTED TO LET MARIO RIDE A DINOSAUR, BUT HARDWARE LIMITATIONS DIDN'T ALLOW IT AT THE TIME.

RYAN MCCAFFREYFEW GAMES HAD MORE OF A BUILDUP PRIOR TO THEIR RELEASE THAN HALO 2, AND EVEN FEWER MANAGED TO LIVE UP TO THEM IN THE WAY THAT HALO 2 DID. MASTER CHIEF TAKING THE FIGHT WITH THE COVENANT TO EARTH WAS EPIC, ACTION-PACKED, AND VISUALLY STUNNING ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX. SURE, THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T SO MUCH END AS MUCH AS STOPPED, BUT THE SHOCKING REVEAL OF THE PLAYABLE ARBITER AND HIS STORY THAT MIRRORED THE CHIEF'S WAS A TWIST NO ONE SAW COMING.

FURTHERMORE, AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, HALO 2 WAS THE KILLER APP FOR XBOX LIVE. IT BROUGHT THE PARTY SYSTEM AND MATCHMAKING HOPPER CONCEPT TO CONSOLES, INSTANTLY MAKING EVERY OTHER ONLINE CONSOLE GAME LOOK ARCHAIC IN ITS INFRASTRUCTURE BY COMPARISON. OF COURSE, IT HELPED THAT THE MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY WAS, WELL, LEGENDARY. THE MAPS WERE ALMOST ALL MEMORABLY BRILLIANT, THE MATCH OPTIONS WERE VAST, AND THE RANKING SYSTEM KEPT YOU FIGHTING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TO TRY AND MOVE UP. HALO 2 REMAINS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR CONSOLE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER MULTIPLAYER, DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE ITS RELEASE.

BUNGIE DID LATER ADMIT THAT THERE WAS INDEED SUPPOSED TO BE A LAST LEVEL TO HALO 2 THAT NEVER MADE IT IN, AS THE TEAM DIDN'T HAVE TIME AFTER REWORKING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE RELEASE.
343 INDUSTRIES SHOWED OFF BUNGIE'S INFAMOUS E3 2003 HALO 2 CAMPAIGN DEMO ON A LIVESTREAM LAST YEAR, PROVING THAT THE NEVER-RELEASED BUILD WAS ACTUALLY REAL AND COULD BE PLAYED.

JUSTIN DAVISSYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT IS BELOVED BY GAMERS THE WORLD OVER THANKS TO ITS RESPONSIVE CONTROLS COMBINED WITH ITS EXPANSIVE, REWARDING GAME WORLD. IF YOU MAKE A GAME CHARACTER THAT’S FUN TO CONTROL, AND THEN PUT THAT CHARACTER IN A UNIQUE WORLD FULL OF SECRETS THAT REWARD THE INQUISITIVE, THE END RESULT IS A GAME THAT’S VERY HARD NOT TO LOVE.

BUT IT’S ONE SPECIFIC MOMENT IN SYMPHONY THAT ELEVATES IT FROM MERELY BEING A “GAME I LOVE” INTO ITS POSITION AS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE. IT’S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EPIC VIDEO GAME SECRETS OF ALL TIME. AFTER YOU’VE PLAYED THROUGH THE ENTIRE GAME, DEFEATING MASSIVE BOSSES, EQUIPPING BADASS LOOT AND DISCOVERING DOZENS OF SECRETS, RIGHT AT THE MOMENT YOU THINK YOU’RE ABOUT TO WIN, YOU DISCOVER YOU’RE ONLY HALFWAY DONE! SYMPHONY’S (SPOILERS!) INVERTED SECOND CASTLE IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST A LAZY WAY TO EXTEND THE QUEST. IT HAS DEVILISH NEW ENEMY PATTERNS, NEW BOSSES, AND FANTASTIC NEW EQUIPMENT. NOT BAD FOR A SECRET THAT IS EASY TO MISS ENTIRELY.

SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST A FUN SIDE-SCROLLER WITH AN AWESOME TWIST, THOUGH. DRACULA’S CASTLE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE VARIED, FILLED WITH GORGEOUS GOTHIC PIXEL ART AND BACKED UP BY A FANTASTIC SOUNDTRACK. ALUCARD AND ALL OF HIS MONSTROUS FOES ARE LUSCIOUSLY ANIMATED. IT’S BASICALLY THE ENTIRE PACKAGE. ART, ANIMATION, SOUND, GAMEPLAY, DESIGN… EVEN REPLAY VALUE, THANKS TO MULTIPLE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS. IT ALL COMES TOGETHER PERFECTLY.

DID YOU KNOW?

TURN IT ON AND PICK A STREET. ANY STREET. ANALYSE IT; REALLY ABSORB IT. LOOK AT THE UNIQUE SHOPFRONTS THAT AREN’T REPEATED ANYWHERE ELSE. LOOK AT THE ASPHALT, WORN AND CRACKED; PUNISHED BY THE MILLIONS OF CARS THAT HAVE HYPOTHETICALLY PASSED OVER IT. LOOK AT THE LITTER, THE GRAFFITI. GRAND THEFT AUTO V’S MAD MIX OF HIGH-SPEED CHASES, CINEMATIC SHOOTOUTS, AND HECTIC HEISTS MAY BE OUTRAGEOUS AT TIMES, BUT THE ENVIRONMENT IT UNFOLDS WITHIN IS JUST SO REAL.

A TECHNICAL TITAN AND AN ENDLESS SOURCE OF EMERGENT FUN, IT’S NO WONDER GRAND THEFT AUTO V IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GAMES EVER MADE. NO GAME SELLS 90 MILLION COPIES BY ACCIDENT.

DID YOU KNOW?
GRAND THEFT AUTO V COST AN ESTIMATED $265 MILLION TO MAKE.
IT MADE $1 BILLION DOLLARS IN ITS FIRST 72 HOURS.
IN FACT, IT MADE ITS BUDGET BACK WITH PRE-ORDERS ALONE.

DANIEL KRUPAMARIO GAMES ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH FUN AND INNOVATION, AND PERHAPS MARIO 64 IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER. IT GATHERED THE CORE ELEMENTS OF MARIO’S BEST 2D, SIDE-SCROLLING ADVENTURES AND WORKED OUT HOW TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO A GROUNDBREAKING 3D WORLD. IT WAS STILL RECOGNISABLY MARIO – HE COLLECTED MUSHROOMS AND RAN AND JUMPED HIS WAY TO SUCCESS, BUT HE WAS FOREVER CHANGED. HE COULD NOW LONG JUMP, TRIPLE JUMP, AND BACKFLIP. WHILE THE UNDERLYING CHALLENGE REMAINED THE SAME AND THE LOCATIONS WERE REASSURINGLY FAMILIAR, THE SHIFT IN PERSPECTIVE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

WHAT’S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THAT MARIO DID NOT SIMPLY ENTER A NEW DIMENSION WITH EASE, HE DID IT WITH STYLE THAT FEW GAMES UNBURDENED WITH SUCH TECHNICAL CHALLENGES EVER ACHIEVE. MARIO 64 MIGHT NOW LOOK A LITTLE BLOCKY BUT IT REMAINS BOLD AND BRILLIANT, TOO.

DID YOU KNOW?
SHIGERU MIYAMOTO DELAYED THE LAUNCH OF THE N64 IN JAPAN – FROM LATE 1995 TO APRIL 1996 – SO THEY COULD PUT MORE WORK INTO SUPER MARIO 64.
A RIDEABLE HORSE WAS DISCUSSED BUT NOT USED. THIS IDEA WOULD LATER PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR EPONA IN THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME.
THERE WAS A SEQUEL PLANNED FOR THE NINTENDO 64DD, BUT IT WAS CANCELED AFTER THE EXPANSION CONSOLE FAILED.

JON RYAN IF YOU'RE READING THIS LIST AND HAVEN'T PLAYED RED DEAD REDEMPTION, GO FIND YOURSELF A COPY OF THE GAME AND THE APPROPRIATE CONSOLE TO PLAY IT ON. RIGHT NOW. WE'LL WAIT THE 30+ HOURS – THIS IS IMPORTANT.

2008'S GTA 4 MAY HAVE BEEN THE REASON THAT I BOUGHT AN XBOX 360, BUT RDR IS THE REASON I KEPT IT. NOT ONLY DID I GET COMPLETELY LOST IN THE MASSIVE SINGLE-PLAYER WORLD, TO THE POINT WHERE I'D STARTED TALKING WITH A BIT OF A DRAWL BECAUSE I WAS SO USED TO HEARING IT, BUT IT ALSO DREW ME INTO ONLINE GAMING UNLIKE ANYTHING I'D PLAYED BEFORE. SURE, COD WAS FUN FOR A BIT AND RACING GAMES WERE OKAY, BUT NEVER BEFORE HAD I SO SUCCESSFULLY CRAFTED MY OWN STORIES AND ADVENTURES (WITH FRIENDS AND STRANGERS ALIKE) THAN IN RED DEAD'S FREE ROAM MODE.

IT WAS THE KIND OF GAME YOU COULDN'T WAIT TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR FRIENDS THE NEXT DAY. "DID YOU SAVE THAT WOMAN ON THE TRAIN TRACKS?" "NO, BUT I FOUND THIS CABIN THAT HAD, LIKE, 1,000 COUGARS IN IT," "THAT'S COOL, BUT DID YOU KILL SASQUATCH?" EVERYONE HAD THEIR OWN AMAZING TALES TO TELL ABOUT THEIR TIME IN THE OLD WEST, AND YOU WERE CONSTANTLY MAKING NEW ONES EVERY TIME YOU TURNED IT ON. THE ONLY REAL DOWNSIDE TO RED DEAD IS THAT IT NEVER CAME OUT ON PC – WHICH IS MOSTLY SAD BECAUSE MY 360 DIED YEARS AGO AND I REALLY WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN.

DID YOU KNOW?
ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED, RED DEAD REDEMPTION IS TECHNICALLY A SEQUEL TO RED DEAD REVOLVER.
DEVELOPMENT TOOK FIVE YEARS.

CAM SHEAHALF-LIFE 2 FOREVER CHANGED OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT A FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER COULD BE. ITS RICHLY IMAGINED WORLD AND WONDERFULLY PACED GAMEPLAY IS A DELIGHT, NEVER LETTING UP AND BRIMMING WITH INVENTION. THE GRAVITY GUN IS OBVIOUSLY THE POSTER CHILD OF HALF-LIFE 2, TURNING EACH ENVIRONMENT INTO A TACTILE PLAYGROUND IN WHICH YOU CAN CREATE IMPROVISED WEAPONS AND SOLVE BASIC BUT CLEVER PHYSICS PUZZLES - AND ITS IMPORTANCE CAN’T BE OVERSTATED - BUT THERE’S AN AWFUL LOT MORE HERE.

WE’RE INTRODUCED TO ALYX VANCE, A SUPPORTING CHARACTER WITH A RARE WARMTH AND INTELLIGENCE. WE’RE TRANSPORTED TO AN ICONIC CITY, WHERE COMBINE BARRICADES LOOM WITH GRIM AUTHORITY, AND STRIDERS STALK THE STREETS WITH AN OTHERWORLDLY MENACE. WE GET TO SET ANTLIONS ON OUR ENEMIES AND IN WHICH WE PLAY FETCH WITH A ROBOT DOG. IN SHORT, IT IS A TRULY MEMORABLE PIECE OF GAME DESIGN.

DID YOU KNOW?
WARREN SPECTOR WAS, AT ONE POINT, WORKING ON AN EPISODE FOR HALF-LIFE 2. IT WAS CANCELED AND HIS STUDIO WORKED ON EPIC MICKEY INSTEAD.
MERLE DANDRIDGE, THE VOICE OF ALYX VANCE, ALSO APPEARS IN THE LAST OF US, DOTA 2, AND SONS OF ANARCHY.

MEGHAN SULLIVAN THE CLASSIC RUSSIAN TITLE-MATCHING PUZZLE GAME BY ALEXEY PAJITNOV BLEW MY MIND WAY BACK IN THE DAY. EVEN AS A LITTLE GIRL, I WAS OBSESSED WITH TETRIS. I’D NEVER PLAYED A VIDEO GAME THAT MENTALLY STIMULATING, LET ALONE THAT ADDICTIVE.

I STILL REMEMBER SPENDING HOURS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV WITH THE NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SITTING AT MY FEET, ROTATING BRIGHTLY COLORED PUZZLE PIECES AS THEY FELL FROM THE ABYSS, ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE THEM INTO HORIZONTAL LINES THAT WHEN ASSEMBLED CORRECTLY WOULD DISAPPEAR AND CAUSE ME TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT STAGE. IT WAS CRAZY FUN, EVEN WHEN BLOCKS BEGAN TO FALL AT AN ALARMINGLY FAST PACE AND I FELL INTO A FRENZIED PANIC. (I STILL REMEMBER HOW FRUSTRATED I’D GET MAKING CARELESS MISTAKES THAT RESULTED IN GIANT, PIXELATED TOWERS OF PISA.)

BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAD TO START THE GAME OVER, IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FUN TO STOP. THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT THIS TIME I’D GET THE RIGHT PUZZLE PIECE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND COULD MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE. I NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT, AND EVEN NOW TETRIS REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES OF ALL TIME.

DID YOU KNOW?
THE NAME TETRIS IS DERIVED FROM THE GREEK NUMERICAL PREFIX TETRA- AS WELL AS TENNIS, CREATOR ALEXEY PAJITNOV'S FAVORITE SPORT.
IT WAS THE FIRST GAME EXPORTED FROM THE USSR TO THE UNITED STATES.
TETRIS WAS THE FIRST VIDEO GAME PLAYED IN SPACE.

JUSTIN DAVISAS A KID, I PLAYED ALMOST ANY GAME THAT HAD A COOL CHARACTER ON THE BOX OR STARRED MY BELOVED NINJA TURTLES. BUT EVEN THEN, ALTHOUGH I LACKED THE VOCABULARY TO EXPLAIN IT, I KNEW THAT SUPER MARIO BROS. WAS SPECIAL, AND BETTER THAN ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE. SO WHEN I RECEIVED SUPER MARIO BROS. 3 FROM SANTA ONE YEAR, AND SAW ON THE BACK OF THE BOX THAT MARIO COULD FLY, I KNEW I WAS IN FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL.

THE GAME EXCEEDED MY EVERY HOPE AND WISH FOR IT, AND I SPENT HUNDREDS OF BLISSFUL AFTERNOONS DEFEATING KOOPA KIDS, RESCUING KINGS, AND DISCOVERING SECRETS STREWN THROUGHOUT MUSHROOM WORLD. MARIO 3 EARNED A PLACE ON MY LIST OF FAVORITE GAMES WAY BACK IN 1990, AND 25 YEARS OF GAMING PROGRESS HAVE YET TO DISLODGE IT.

SUPER MARIO BROS. 3 IS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF HOW TO MAKE A PERFECT VIDEO GAME SEQUEL. IT’S A MIXTURE OF THE ORIGINAL’S BEST ELEMENTS, COMBINED WITH AN ALMOST EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF IMAGINATIVE NEW IDEAS. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SO QUINTESSENTIALLY MARIO – THE SUITS, THE BOOS, THE OVERWORLD – ALL ACTUALLY ORIGINATED HERE.

DID YOU KNOW?
SUPER MARIO BROS. 3 WAS THE FIRST MARIO GAME TO INTRODUCE AN OVERWORLD.
THE SUPER LEAF ALLOWED MARIO TO FLY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
IT CAME OUT IN THE US ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER JAPAN.

BRIAN ALTANOTHE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD ESCHEWED THE SEMI-LINEAR, BORDERLINE PREDICTABLE PATH OF THE 3D ZELDA GAMES BEFORE IT IN FAVOR OF A BOLD, CRAZY NEW APPROACH: LET PLAYERS DO WHAT THEY WANT, HOW THEY WANT, AND IN WHATEVER ORDER THEY DECIDE.

BY MARRYING AN OPEN-ENDED APPROACH TO QUEST STRUCTURE WITH THE ABILITY TO FREELY EXPLORE A VAST, BEAUTIFUL, INTRIGUING WORLD WITH LITTLE SPECIFIC REGULATION, THE 3D ZELDA GAME TEMPLATE WAS SHATTERED ABOUT AS FAST AS THE AVERAGE BREAKABLE WEAPON IN BREATH OF THE WILD. THE RESULT IS A GORGEOUS, FREEING OPEN-WORLD ACTION/ADVENTURE EXPERIENCE THAT EVOKES THE WONDER AND FEAR OF EXPLORING A BOLD NEW PLACE WITH THE EMPOWERING TANGIBILITY OF BECOMING ITS HERO.

DID YOU KNOW?
THERE ARE 900 KOROK SEEDS HIDDEN ACROSS BREATH OF THE WILD'S MASSIVE MAP AND FINDING THEM ALL WILL REWARD PLAYERS WITH ONE OF THE WEIRDEST PRIZES IN THE HISTORY OF ZELDA GAMES - A USELESS, GOLDEN STATUE SHAPED LIKE A TURD.
SPEEDRUNNERS HAVE TAKEN A HUGE LIKING TO BREATH OF THE WILD DUE IT ITS FREEFORM QUEST LAYOUT, ALLOWING SKILLED PLAYERS TO BYPASS MOST OF THE GAME'S CONTENT AND TAKE ON THE FINAL BOSS FIGHT VERY EARLY ON.

JUSTIN DAVISSUPER METROID’S MINIMALISTIC ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING SET A BAR, WAY BACK IN 1994, THAT I BELIEVE HAS STILL YET TO BE ECLIPSED. THE PLANET ZEBES IS ATMOSPHERIC, OPPRESSIVE, AND EXTREMELY LETHAL. AT FIRST GLANCE, THERE DOESN’T EVEN APPEAR TO BE ANY STORY. BUT THEN YOU START TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY. THE PARASITE-RIDDLED DEAD SOLDIER OUTSIDE OF AN EARLY BOSS ROOM. THE CRASHED, HALF-SUBMERGED ALIEN SPACESHIP THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE HAUNTED. THE TECHNO LAIR OF THE SPACE PIRATES HIDING UNDER YOUR NOSE THE ENTIRE GAME. IT’S BRILLIANT AND CONFIDENT. IT DOESN’T EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT EACH NEW AREA IS ALL ABOUT. IT’S ALL THERE, FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT (OR IGNORE) ON YOUR OWN.

BUT IT’S SUPER METROID’S ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY INVITE THE PLAYER TO BE CURIOUS – AND THEN REWARDING THAT CURIOSITY – THAT MAKES IT ONE OF THE GREATEST VIDEO GAMES EVER MADE. IT’S NOT JUST THAT THERE ARE SECRETS HIDDEN EVERYWHERE (ALTHOUGH THERE ARE, AND IT’S AWESOME) – IT’S THAT THE GAME TEASES YOU WITH TANTALIZING CLUES – ITEMS, ALWAYS JUST OUT OF REACH. AN ENERGY TANK EMBEDDED IN A SEEMINGLY IMPASSABLE WALL. A PAIR OF MISSILES ONLY OBTAINABLE FROM THE COLLAPSING BLOCKS ABOVE, LEAVING YOU NO IDEA OF HOW TO GET UP THERE, JUST WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN GET UP THERE.

SUPER METROID IS AN IMPECCABLE ACTION-PLATFORMER – THAT’S THE “EASY” PART. WHAT MAKES IT TRULY SPECIAL IS ITS GENIUS COMBINATION OF PUZZLE-SOLVING, ATMOSPHERE, STORYTELLING, EXPLORATION, GAME DESIGN, AND GAMEPLAY. THERE’S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.

DID YOU KNOW?
SUPER METROID WAS RELEASED ON A 24 MEGABIT CARTRIDGE, MAKING IT THE LARGEST SNES GAME AT THE TIME.
IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A CORE TEAM OF JUST 15 PEOPLE.
IT SOLD POORLY IN JAPAN, BUT FARED FAR BETTER IN THE US.

TOM MARKSPORTAL UNDOUBTEDLY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND SHATTERED THE MOLD, BUT PORTAL 2 TOOK THAT RAW AND INCREDIBLE CONCEPT AND MANAGED TO SHAPE IT INTO A MORE POLISHED AND IMPRESSIVE PACKAGE. IT CRANKED THE DIALS UP ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL SO SPECIAL. THE MIND-BENDING PUZZLES, THE SURPRISINGLY DARK STORY, AND THE RIDICULOUS HUMOR THAT BALANCED IT OUT - EACH PIECE OF THAT PICTURE WAS REFINED AND REFRESHED TO BUILD A SEQUEL THAT ACTUALLY SURPASSED THE AMBITION OF AN ALREADY EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS GAME, MAKING SOMETHING BOTH FAMILIAR AND ALTOGETHER NEW.

IT GAVE US A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF APERTURE SCIENCE WITHOUT COMPLETELY DRAGGING ALL OF ITS MYSTERIES OUT INTO THE LIGHT. IT ALSO MIXED ITS “THINKING WITH PORTALS” PUZZLES UP EVEN FURTHER BY WEAVING IN GEL MECHANICS THAT FELT ENTIRELY FRESH AND COMPLETELY NATURAL AT THE SAME TIME - WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SUBTLY USING THEM TO TIE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS INTO THE STORY, PATIENTLY WAITING UNTIL ITS INCREDIBLE FINALE TO PAY OFF THOSE SETUPS WITH ONE OF THE WEIRDEST AND MOST SPECTACULAR VIDEO GAME ENDINGS AROUND. COUPLE THAT WITH A SERIOUSLY GOOD CO-OP CAMPAIGN AND EVEN A FULL-ON CUSTOM LEVEL BUILDER AND SHARING SYSTEMS ADDED POST-LAUNCH AND PORTAL 2 HAS STAYED THE HIGH BAR BY WHICH ALL FIRST-PERSON PUZZLE GAMES SHOULD BE MEASURED, EVEN NEARLY A DECADE LATER.

DID YOU KNOW?
PORTAL 2'S PLUCKY PERSONALITY CORE WHEATLEY IS VOICED BY ENGLISH ACTOR STEPHEN MERCHANT, BEST KNOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL UK VERSION OF THE OFFICE AND PLENTY MORE TV SHOWS.
MERCHANT ISN'T THE ONLY CELEBRITY GUEST: THE VOICE OF APERTURE'S CAVE JOHNSON IS PLAYED BY J.K SIMMONS, KNOWN FOR MOVIES LIKE WHIPLASH AND RECENTLY RETURNING TO HIS ROLE AS J. JONAH JAMESON IN SPIDER-MAN.

FROM IT’S UNFORGETTABLE BEGINNINGS GUIDING A SWORDLESS LINK THROUGH THE RAIN, TO THE FINAL SHOWDOWN WITH GANON AND UTILIZING MASTERY OF SWORD AND BOW TO DEFEAT EVIL, LINK TO THE PAST MEASURED OUT A PERFECT PACE OF DUNGEONS, EXPLORATION, AND A GRIPPING NARRATIVE THAT WAS ALMOST UNHEARD OF AT THE TIME. IT’S OPEN LANDSCAPE WAS ALWAYS INVITING BUT NEVER FELT AIMLESS – STRIKING THE PERFECT BALANCE OF FREEDOM AND PURPOSE IN YOUR QUEST TO SAVE PRINCESS ZELDA.

THIS ITERATION OF HYRULE WAS MORE THAN JUST MOVING BETWEEN ENEMY-FILLED SCREENS, IT ENCOMPASSED EVERYTHING AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE: A VAST OPEN WORLD THAT TEASED YOU WITH SECRETS HIDING JUST BEYOND YOUR REACH, BEGGING YOU TO COME BACK WITH NEW AND INVENTIVE TOOLS. EACH ZONE – WHETHER IN THE CHEERFUL OVERWORLD, DIMLY LIT CAVES, OR THE INTIMIDATING DARK WORLD – WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE THROUGH A CULMINATION OF DETAILS LIKE THE SOUND OF THE TEMPERED SWORD CLEAVING THE AIR, THE CATCHY JINGLE OF A PUZZLE WELL-SOLVED, AND THE AMBIENT TUNES OF KOJI KONDO’S SCORE. THIS VERSION OF HYRULE MORE THAN ANY OTHER BEFORE OR SINCE, IS THE ONE I FELL MOST IN LOVE WITH.

SAMUEL CLAIBORN IN NEARLY THREE DECADES NO GAME HAS SUPPLANTED SUPER MARIO WORLD AS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE... WHICH IS STUPID. I’LL GET TO THAT IN A BIT. SUPER MARIO WORLD IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE GAME TO DESCRIBE. IT’S A SUPER MARIO GAME, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS: MUSHROOMS; PERFECT RUNNING AND JUMPING ACTION; AND A GIANT WORLD TO EXPLORE, CRAMMED WITH SECRETS.

BUT WHAT SETS SUPER MARIO WORLD APART FROM OTHER 2D MARIO GAMES IS ITS IRRESISTIBLE COMPLEXITY. SUBSEQUENT SUPER MARIO GAMES, LIKE THE NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. SERIES, SIMPLIFIED THE OVERWORLD, TRADING SUPER MARIO WORLD’S COOL HIDDEN PATHS FOR LINEAR TRACKS, LARGELY ABANDONED THE SKIES AND TREETOPS OF SUPER MARIO WORLD’S VERTICAL LEVELS FOR GROUND-BASED OBSTACLE COURSES, AND DID AWAY WITH FLYING ALMOST ENTIRELY (CAPES RULE, HELICOPTER HATS DROOL!). SUPER MARIO WORLD IS THE CRESCENDO TO THE SLOW BUILD IN TECHNOLOGY AND GAME DESIGN THAT STARTED WITH SUPER MARIO BROS. AND THAT CRESCENDO FEATURED A COOL, SIMULATED 90S SLAP BASS TRACK.

SO LOOK, WE WANT TO PLAY A BETTER GAME THAN SUPER MARIO WORLD. THERE’S NO GREAT, EXISTENTIAL REASON FOR SUPER MARIO WORLD TO REMAIN AT THE TOP OF IGN’S LIST. LET SUPER MARIO WORLD’S PLACEMENT ON THIS LIST BE A CHALLENGE TO FUTURE GAME DEVELOPERS. WE DARE YOU TO MAKE A BETTER GAME: PUZZLING, BUT NOT OPAQUE; TOUGH BUT NOT INTIMIDATING; BEAUTIFUL, FUNNY, JOYFUL, AND UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZABLE. AND, WHILE WE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, DINOSAURS ARE ALWAYS A PLUS.
