BRANDIN TYRRELAS THE SECOND 3D GAME IN THE NOW MEGA-SERIES GRAND THEFT AUTO, VICE CITY HAD ENORMOUS SHOES TO FILL COMING OFF THE GROUNDBREAKING STATEMENT THAT WAS GRAND THEFT AUTO III. AND DID IT EVER DELIVER. SET DURING THE 1980S IN ROCKSTAR’S FACSIMILE OF MIAMI, THE VIOLENCE, SEX, AND EXCESS OF THIS DEFINING DECADE WAS SLATHERED ACROSS A FULLY PLAYABLE WORLD OF WANNABE GANGSTERS, SPORTS CARS, MOUNTAINS OF DRUGS, AND BRIEFCASES FULL OF BILLS.

MINING VEINS OF CONTENT FROM SCARFACE, MIAMI VICE, AND OTHER SEMINAL POP CULTURE PILLARS OF THE ERA, VICE CITY HAD IT ALL: A CAST OF LARGER-THAN-LIFE CHARACTERS AND A RAGS-TO-RICHES PROTAGONIST WHO BUILDS HIS EMPIRE ON THE BLOOD, SWEAT, AND MORE BLOOD OF THE SUN-SOAKED, DRUG-ADDLED, SEX-CRAZED SLICE OF BEACH CITY. AND IT'S THAT ‘80S PERSONALITY THAT PROPPED UP VICE CITY ANY TIME ITS OPEN-WORLD GAMEPLAY STARTED TO FALTER – MUCH OF THAT PERSONALITY COMING FROM THE INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK THAT IS ALONE WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION. GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITY IS A SEXY, SOUR, EXCELLENT SENDUP OF THE DECADE THAT WILL NEVER DIE.

DID YOU KNOW?
VICE CITY SURVIVED TWO LAWSUITS LEAD BY ANTI-VIDEO GAME ACTIVIST JACK THOMPSON, WHO CLAIMED IT WAS LINKED TO REAL CRIMES.
THAT FAMOUSLY '80S SOUNDTRACK HAS RESULTED IN A FEW LICENSING ISSUES OVER THE YEARS, SEEING CERTAIN SONGS CUT FROM DIFFERENT VERSIONS.
ITS SCRIPT WAS OVER 1,000 PAGES LONG AND OVER 8,000 LINES OF DIALOGUE WERE RECORDED – FOUR TIMES AS MUCH DIALOGUE AS GRAND THEFT AUTO III.

ANDREW GOLDFARBPERSONA 5 FEELS LIKE THE PERSONA GAME THE TEAM ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE BUT DIDN’T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE. WITH HAND-BUILT PALACES INSTEAD OF PROCEDURALLY-GENERATED DUNGEONS, A STUNNING VISUAL STYLE AND ART DIRECTION, AND A MEMORABLE AND MOVING SOUNDTRACK, THIS EASILY STANDS OUT AS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PERSONA GAME YET. EVERYTHING FROM THE UI TO SCENE TRANSITIONS TO THE ANIMATED CUTSCENES IS ABSOLUTELY DRIPPING WITH STYLE, AND THE BATTLE SYSTEM COMBINES SERIES STAPLES WITH MECHANICS THAT HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE FRANCHISE IN OVER A DECADE FOR PERFECTLY BALANCED FIGHTS. ALL OF THAT ON TOP OF A FANTASTIC STORY AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS MAKE THIS ONE OF THE BEST JRPGS EVER MADE.

STELLA CHUNGFORTNITE CHANGED THE PLAYING FIELD OF BATTLE ROYALES UPON ITS RELEASE IN 2017. ORIGINALLY STARTING OUT AS A PURCHASE TO PLAY COOPERATIVE SHOOTER-SURVIVAL GAME WITH THE TITLE “SAVE THE WORLD,” EPIC GAMES BRANCHED OUT AND OPENED UP AN EARLY ACCESS FORTNITE BATTLE ROYALE MODE. OVER 10 MILLION PLAYERS AMASSED OVER THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE RELEASE AND EPIC QUICKLY CHANGED THEIR BATTLE ROYALE TO A FREE-TO-PLAY MODEL. ALMOST OVERNIGHT, FORTNITE BECAME THE REIGNING BATTLE ROYALE GAME TO PLAY AS CONSISTENT UPDATES TO THE MAP AND LIMITED-TIME GAME MODES ROLLED OUT. WITH THE STEADY FLOW OF FRESH CONTENT AND UPDATES TO FORTNITE’S BATTLE ROYALE, IT STANDS OUT IN ITS GENRE AS A COLORFUL AND UNIQUE TITLE OTHER GAMES HAVE YET TO COMPETE WITH.

DID YOU KNOW?
FORTNITE ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE CROSSPLAY OPTIONS WITH SWITCH PLAYERS MATCHING UP WITH IOS AND ANDROID. HOWEVER IOS AND ANDROID PLAYERS CAN ALSO PLAY AGAINST THE PC, MAC, PLAYSTATION AND XBOX POPULATION.
EPIC GAMES REPORTED THAT 10.7 MILLION PEOPLE ATTENDED THE VIRTUAL MARSHMELLO CONCERT THAT TOOK PLACE IN-GAME ON FEBRUARY 2ND.

FABLE 2, HOWEVER, FULFILLED AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF THIS CHARMING, DECIDEDLY BRITISH-HUMORED ACTION-ADVENTURE. THE WORLD OF ALBION CAME ALIVE ON THE XBOX 360, WHILE FABLE 2 WAS ALSO ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES TO GIVE YOU A FULL-TIME CANINE COMPANION. THE DOG WAS, IN GAMEPLAY TERMS, RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT FOR MANY PLAYERS, THE POOCH TUGGED ON YOUR HEARTSTRINGS AND MADE YOU CARE ABOUT HIM/HER IN A WAY THAT YOU TYPICALLY WOULDN'T ABOVE THE AVERAGE HUMAN OR FANTASY-PET RPG. SOLID COMBAT, A MULTIPLE-CHOICE ENDING, GREAT MUSIC AND WORLD-BUILDING, AND A DEFT BALANCE OF ACTION, ADVENTURE, AND ROLE-PLAYING HELPED MAKE FABLE 2 BOTH THE PINNACLE OF THE SERIES AND ONE OF THE FINEST BITS OF ESCAPIST FANTASY EVER CODED.

DID YOU KNOW?
AS IN THE ORIGINAL FABLE, YOU COULD BE PURELY GOOD OR DIABOLICALLY EVIL IN FABLE 2, AND YOUR CHARACTER'S APPEARANCE WOULD CHANGE ACCORDINGLY.
FABLE 2 ALLOWED YOU TO GET MARRIED IF YOU WOOED AN NPC ENOUGH, AND IN A GAMING RARITY, FABLE 2 DIDN'T RESTRICT YOU TO MARRYING THE OPPOSITE GENDER OF THE ONE YOU WERE PLAYING.
FABLE 2 PUB GAMES RELEASED A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE THE FULL AND PROPER FABLE 2. IT ALLOWED YOU TO EARN VIRTUAL CURRENCY THAT COULD BE CARRIED OVER INTO FABLE 2.

ALEX SIMMONSWHEN I WAS YOUNGER, FEW GAMES SETTLED AN ARGUMENT LIKE GOLDENEYE. LIVING IN A FLAT WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE, IF WE COULDN’T DECIDE LIKE RATIONAL ADULTS WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO DO THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES, IT WAS DECIDED OVER A GAME OF GOLDENEYE’S MULTIPLAYER. THE BATTLEGROUND WAS ALWAYS THE FACILITY AND TO TRULY SORT OUT THE MEN FROM THE BONDS IT WAS SLAPS ONLY. ANYONE WHO PICKED ODD JOB WAS INSTANTLY DISQUALIFIED.

IN 1997, GOLDENEYE WAS A REVELATION. NOT ONLY WAS IT A MORE-THAN-DECENT MOVIE TIE-IN – I’M HARD PUSHED TO THINK OF ONE THAT’S COME CLOSE, EVEN TO THIS DAY – BUT IT BECAME THE BLUEPRINT FOR CONSOLE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTERS, SERVING UP A WONDERFULLY ENGAGING SINGLE-PLAYER MODE THAT MADE YOU FEEL LIKE BOND, WITH SPLIT-SCREEN MULTIPLAYER THAT QUICKLY BECAME A STAPLE IN DORM ROOMS ACROSS THE WORLD.

IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST TIME I REALISED HOW SATISFYING IT IS TO TAKE OUT A TARGET FROM AFAR USING A SNIPER RIFLE. 18 YEARS LATER IT’S STILL MY GO-TO WEAPON IN ANY GAME.

DID YOU KNOW?
GOLDENEYE 007'S BELOVED MULTIPLAYER MODE WAS A LAST-MINUTE ADDITION SNUCK IN BY DEVELOPERS WITHOUT RARE OR NINTENDO MANAGEMENT'S PERMISSION.
SHIGERU MIYAMOTO WAS SO REPULSED BY THE GAME'S VIOLENCE, HE SUGGESTED IT SHOW THE PLAYER SHAKING HANDS WITH THEIR HOSPITALIZED ENEMIES.
THIS WAS THE REASON THE CREATORS INCLUDED A CURTAIN CALL AT THE END, IMPLYING IT WAS ALL PORTRAYED BY ACTORS WITH NO REAL KILLING INVOLVED.

MITCHELL SALTZMANIT’S RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME: SUPER SMASH BROS. ULTIMATE IS QUITE SIMPLY THE ULTIMATE SMASH BROS. GAME. PURISTS WILL NO DOUBT CLAIM THAT SSB: MELEE IS THE GAME THAT PUT THE SERIES ON THE MAP, BUT IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE THE SHEER WEALTH OF CONTENT THAT IS PRESENT IN ULTIMATE, FROM THE INSANE ROSTER SIZE OF 70+ CHARACTERS THAT IS STILL GROWING, TO THE ENORMOUS WORLD OF LIGHT STORY MODE, TO THE LIBRARY OF OVER 800 CLASSIC VIDEO GAME SONGS JAM-PACKED WITHIN ITS CARTRIDGE.

SMASH BROS. HAS ALWAYS BEEN SIMULTANEOUSLY THE QUINTESSENTIAL PARTY FIGHTER, AS WELL AS ONE OF THE MOST HOTLY COMPETITIVE FIGHTING GAMES ON THE SCENE, A SPLIT THAT HAS RESULTED IN TWO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES FOR THE SERIES. WHAT’S MOST AMAZING ABOUT SUPER SMASH BROS. ULTIMATE, AND ALL THE TEAMS INVOLVED IN ITS CREATION, IS THAT THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SERVE BOTH THOSE AUDIENCES AT THE SAME TIME, DELIVERING A FIGHTING GAME THAT IS JUST AS FUN FOR THE CASUAL AUDIENCE, AS IT IS FOR THE HARDCORE CROWD.

DID YOU KNOW?
SMASH: ULTIMATE’S CURRENT ROSTER HAS 73 (SOON TO BE 74) FIGHTERS: 65 FROM EVERY OTHER GAME IN THE SERIES AND 9 NEW ONES FROM FRANCHISES LIKE SPLATOON AND CASTLEVANIA.
POST-LAUNCH ADDITIONS TO THE ROSTER INCLUDE JOKER FROM PERSONA 5, BANJO-KAZOOIE, AND THE DIVISIVE "HERO" FROM DRAGON QUEST.

BRANDIN TYRRELSKYRIM WAS A PIVOTAL TURNING POINT FOR ME AND MY OVER TWENTY-YEAR LOVE AFFAIR WITH ROLE-PLAYING GAMES. IT WAS THE MOMENT THAT WORLDS BECAME SO BIG, SO IMMERSIVE, AND SO DETAILED THAT I RESOLVED I WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON MY BURNING DESIRE TO OVERTURN EVERY ROCK, CHASE EVERY QUEST, AND COLLECT EVERY THINGY.

TO ME, EVERYTHING ABOUT SKYRIM WAS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER ITS PREDECESSOR, OBLIVION. THE CRAGGY, INTIMIDATING PEAKS OF THE NORD HOMELAND AND THE SAGA OF THE DOVAHKIIN WERE MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THE RELATIVELY SEDATE HAPPENINGS OF THEIR NEIGHBORS IN CYRODIIL. BUT WHAT’S MORE, THERE’S SO MUCH LYING JUST AROUND THE CORNER, OFF THE BEATEN PATH, THAT YOU COULD NEVER EVEN STUMBLE UPON IT IN A HUNDRED HOURS AS THE DRAGONBORN. BUT THE FACT THAT SUCH CARE FOR DETAIL, FOR WORLD-BUILDING, FOR EXPLORATION AND FOR IMMERSION WAS PAID TO EVERY TOME, TOMB, AND QUEST, IS ENOUGH TO CEMENT SKYRIM AS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST ROLE-PLAYING GAMES WE’VE EVER SEEN, AND ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME.

SKYRIM WAS THE FIRST WESTERN-DEVELOPED GAME TO GET A PERFECT SCORE FROM JAPANESE GAME MAGAZINE FAMITSU. THE SECOND WAS GRAND THEFT AUTO V.

X-COM: UFO DEFENSE

DAN STAPLETONX-COM’S MAGIC IS HOW IT MAKES THE WAR TO DEFEND EARTH FROM A VASTLY SUPERIOR ALIEN INVASION FORCE FEEL SO INTENSELY PERSONAL, EVEN WITH ITS EXTREMELY DATED (BUT EXPRESSIVE) GRAPHICS AND SPREADSHEET-LIKE INTERFACE. PART OF THIS COMES FROM THE WAY THAT EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE, FROM WHERE ON THE GLOBE YOU PLACE YOUR BASES, TO WHICH ALIEN TECHNOLOGY TO RESEARCH, TO WHETHER TO SPEND YOUR SOLDIER’S LAST FEW TIME UNITS TO RELOAD HIS WEAPON, CROUCH, OR TAKE A HAIL MARY SHOT AT A DISTANT ALIEN, HAS ENORMOUSLY HIGH STAKES. CHOOSE RIGHT, AND YOUR TEAM OF ALIEN HUNTERS WILL GAIN A LEG UP ON THE BATTLEFIELD FROM ADVANCED WEAPONS (LIKE THE GUIDED BLASTER LAUNCHER MISSILES), ARMOR, OR TACTICAL POSITIONING; CHOOSE POORLY AND LITERALLY EVERYONE COULD BE SLAUGHTERED – OR WORSE, TRANSFORMED INTO DROOLING ZOMBIES TO SERVE AS INCUBATORS FOR HORRIFIC CHRYSSALIDS.

IF YOU’RE DOING IT RIGHT, YOU’VE NAMED EACH OF YOUR VERY MORTAL SOLDIERS AFTER YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, MAKING THE INEVITABLE CASUALTIES YOU’LL TAKE IN COMBAT STING FAR MORE THAN LOSING NAMELESS FODDER. RANDOMLY GENERATED MAPS ENSURE YOU NEVER QUITE KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE LURKING AROUND THE NEXT CORNER, AND DESTRUCTIBLE TERRAIN MEANS THAT KNOCKING DOWN A BUILDING IS ALWAYS AN OPTION. THE UNPREDICTABILITY MAKES THE FEELING OF GOING FROM SCRAPPY UNDERDOG TO ELITE ALIEN-BUTT-KICKING FUTURISTIC SUPER SOLDIER SQUAD INCREDIBLY REWARDING, EVERY SINGLE TIME. EXCEPT WHEN YOU LOSE HORRIBLY.

DID YOU KNOW?
X-COM: UFO DEFENSE WAS ALMOST CANCELED TWICE, FIRST DUE TO MONEY TROUBLES AND AGAIN WHEN ITS PUBLISHER WAS ACQUIRED BY SPECTRUM HOLOBYTE.
THE SECOND TIME IT WAS OFFICIALLY CANCELED, BUT ITS PUBLISHER DECIDED TO IGNORE THEIR PARENT COMPANY'S ORDER SO DEVELOPMENT COULD CONTINUE.
AT THE TIME, ITS DEVELOPERS HAD NO IDEA IT WAS CANCELED – CO-CREATOR JULIAN GOLLOP DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT UNTIL TWO DECADES LATER.

JARED PETTYAKIN TO CHRONO TRIGGER IN STUNNING ART DIRECTION, MECHANICAL SIMPLICITY, AND MUSICAL SIGNIFICANCE, SUIKODEN II DIVERGES FROM SQUARE’S MASTERPIECE IN ITS SENSE OF MORAL AMBIGUITY AND DARK STORYTELLING. FOR THE LONGEST TIME, SUIKODEN II WAS LOCKED BEHIND A NEAR-IMPENETRABLE WALL OF SCARCITY THAT KEPT IT OUT OF THE HANDS OF MOST AMERICAN GAMERS. NOW THAT IT’S FINALLY AVAILABLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE, IT’S A MUST-PLAY FOR ANY RPG FAN.

SUIKODEN II ISN’T ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD. THE SCENARIO INSTEAD FAVORS AN EXTREMELY LOCAL PERSPECTIVE, GRADUALLY EXPANDING OUTWARD FROM YOUR PERSONAL CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES TO ENCOMPASS YOUR PLACE IN A WAR OF FEUDING NATIONS POPULATED BY CHARACTERS WITH COMPLEX, REALISTIC MOTIVATIONS. THERE ARE VERY FEW REAL VILLAINS (WITH ONE EXTREME AND TERRIFYING EXCEPTION), A WEB OF CONSTANTLY CONFLICTING LOYALTIES AND ALLIANCES, AND A MACHIAVELLIAN PRAGMATISM THAT WILL ETHICALLY STRAIN YOU AS YOU TRY TO BALANCE YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO FAMILY, FRIENDS, MENTORS, AND YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE.

SUIKODEN II MANAGES TO SUPPORT AN ENORMOUS CAST OF INTERESTING CHARACTERS BY TASKING THE PLAYER WITH BUILDING A STRONGHOLD OF THEIR OWN IN THE WORLD, A FRONTIER NATION OF SORTS POPULATED BY MEN AND WOMEN FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE EAGER TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR SKILLS TO BUILDING SOMETHING BETTER FOR EVERYONE. IT’S A REMARKABLY OPTIMISTIC AND SURPRISINGLY FUN DIVERSION FROM THE TYPICALLY-REACTIVE STORYTELLING STANCE OF MOST RPGS.

DID YOU KNOW?
SUIKODEN II'S STORY WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE FIRST GAME.

BRANDIN TYRRELAS THE VERY FIRST GAME IN WHAT WOULD BECOME A LANDMARK SHOOTER SERIES, BATTLEFIELD 1942 LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR HOW I WOULD BE SPENDING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF MY LIFE. THOUGH NOT THE ONLY COOPERATIVE, TEAM-WORK ORIENTED SHOOTER OF ITS TIME, BATTLEFIELD 1942 WAS IN A CLASS BY ITSELF.

AS FULL BATTLES RIPPED ACROSS HUGE, OPEN LANDSCAPES, WAGED FROM LAND, AIR, AND SEA, THE REALIZATION OF BEING ABLE TO COMMAND A CAPITAL SHIP, LOB TANK SHELLS FROM ONE POINT TO THE NEXT, OR CHANGED THE TIDE OF THE WAR WITH ONE WELL-PLACED BOMBER PAYLOAD WAS INTOXICATING. THERE WAS SIMPLY NOTHING LIKE THE SIZE AND SCALE OF BATTLEFIELD 1942, AND ITS LEGACY HAS ONLY GOTTEN BIGGER OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS SINCE.

MIRANDA SANCHEZDOTA 2 DOESN'T END WHEN THE FINAL UNIT ON THE MAP GOES DOWN, OR EVEN WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR CLIENT. DOTA ISN'T A GAME; IT'S A LIFESTYLE.

VALVE'S MOBA IS ONE OF DEEPEST, MOST MECHANICALLY COMPLEX GAMES EVER MADE, AND THOUGH ITS BASE STAYS THE SAME, MECHANICS ARE ALWAYS BEING CHANGED AND ADDED. THE HIGH BARRIER TO ENTRY WILL DRIVE AWAY NEW PLAYERS, BUT THOSE WHO CRACK THE SHELL AND GET HOOKED HAVE A VERY STRONG CHANCE OF RARELY PLAYING ANYTHING ELSE AGAIN. ITS 100+ HEROES ALL PLAY DIFFERENTLY, AND COMING CLOSE TO TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE COULD TAKE HUNDREDS OF HOURS. EVEN THEN, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW TO LEARN. EVERY FAILED STRATEGY, EVERY DEATH, EVERY COMEBACK IS A CHANCE TO DISCOVER SOMETHING NEW. GETTING BETTER ISN'T JUST ABOUT MAKING NUMBERS GO UP – YOU FEEL THE IMPROVEMENT, AND EVERY TIME YOU OUTPLAY AN ENEMY FEELS AS SATISFYING AS THE FIRST.

DOTA 2 IS AT ITS BEST WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A TEAM OF FIVE FRIENDS. GATHERING GOLD, KILLING ENEMIES, TAKING OBJECTIVES AS A COORDINATED TEAM, THEN MAKING A FINAL PUSH TO VICTORY IS AN INCREDIBLE HIGH THAT YOU'LL WANT TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

ITS SELECTION OF CLASSIC AND BRAND NEW TRACKS MAKE FOR AN EXCELLENT ROTATION OF RACES THAT KEEPS THINGS FRESH NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PLAY, WITH A THOROUGH ROSTER OF RACERS AND PLENTY OF KART CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS.

WHILE IT'S NOT THE MARQUEE ATTRACTION, MARIO KART 8 DELUXE'S SUITE OF MULTIPLAYER OPTIONS BEYOND RACING ARE SOME OF THE BEST THE FRANCHISE HAS HAD SINCE THE N64 DAYS OF BLOCK FORT. BUT IT'S REALLY THE FINELY TUNED RACING OF NINTENDO'S LONGSTANDING FRANCHISE THAT TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT — IT'S NEVER FELT BETTER TO RACE (EVEN IN THE FACE OF BLUE SHELLS), WHILE COURSES ARE BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFULLY DETAILED, AND REPRESENT SOME OF THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE BOTH NEW AND OLD.

MORE THAN JUST MAKING CHOICES ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL, JEDI OUTCAST ALLOWED US TO LIVE OUT OUR FORCE-USING FANTASIES IN A TIME WHERE LIGHTSABER BATTLES WERE MOSTLY RELEGATED TO THE MOVIES.

JEDI OUTCAST MANAGED TO MAKE EVERY ENEMY ENCOUNTER A THRILL – WHETHER THEY BE HAPLESS STORMTROOPERS YOU COULD FLING AROUND LIKE RAGDOLLS, OR NEW SITH APPRENTICES THAT GAVE YOU THE CHANCE TO FEEL LIKE A MASTER AS YOU EXPERTLY CHAINED LIGHTSABER STRIKES IN DIFFERENT STYLES. COUPLED WITH THE ROGUISH WIT AND CHARM OF KYLE KATARN AND HIS QUEST FOR REVENGE MADE JEDI OUTCAST ONE OF THE BEST STORIES IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE.

THE GLOWING MARQUEE AND ART ON THE GAME DEPICTS CHARACTERS THAT BELONG ON A 1960S PIZZA DELIVERY BOX. THIS MACHINE CLEARLY DOESN’T HOLD A STAR WARS-INSPIRED SPACE BATTLE – BUT WHAT’S IN IT? WHEN YOU PUT A QUARTER IN, THE MACHINE SHOWS YOU A LITTLE CARTOON OF AN APE CLAMBERING UP A LADDER, MOCKING YOU. IT ASKS “HOW HIGH CAN YOU GET?” AND THE INSTRUCTIONS END THERE. BARRELS AND FIRE FILL THE SCREEN WHILE THE CHARACTERS’ INTRICATE ANIMATIONS FOR EVERY MOVEMENT CONTINUE THE ILLUSION THAT YOU ARE PLAYING THIS CARTOON. YOU PROBABLY DON’T GET VERY HIGH. HOPEFULLY, YOU HAVE MORE QUARTERS.

WE WERE JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO. ROCK BAND LITERALLY INVENTED A NEW FORM OF MULTIPLAYER – ONE THAT WAS NOT ONLY COOPERATIVE, BUT ALSO ONE WHERE FOUR OF YOU COULD SHARE A PHYSICAL ENERGY IN THE ROOM. IT REMAINS A FEELING THAT NO GAME HAS REPLICATED, AND THE VERY ACT OF LEARNING THE "LANGUAGE" OF THE GAME – TEACHING YOUR HANDS TO WORK THE GUITAR NECK, OR YOUR HANDS AND FEET TO WORK IN CONCERT TO "PLAY" THE DRUMS – WAS A GAME IN AND OF ITSELF. EVEN ONCE YOU LEARNED THAT LANGUAGE, MOVING UP THE RANKS, FROM EASY TO EXPERT, WAS AN ADVENTURE WITH A TANGIBLE PAYOFF: YOU COULD SEE AND FEEL THE RESULTS. AND DOMINATING A CLASSIC SONG YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ALL KNOW AND LOVE AS A FOUR-PLAYER "BAND" PLAYING ON THE HIGHEST DIFFICULTY MADE MEMORIES THAT LAST LONG AFTER THE CONSOLE TURNED OFF.

BUT WHEN YOSHI’S ISLAND CAME OUT, THE REWARD FOR EXPLORATION WAS GREATER THAN A GAMERSCORE: FOR COLLECTING ALL OF THE EXTREMELY WELL-HIDDEN RED COINS AND FLOWERS AND THEN FINISHING A LEVEL WITH 30 STARS (WHICH BASICALLY MEANS YOU CAN’T GET HIT), YOU RECEIVED A 100% RATING. IF YOU DID THIS ON EVERY LEVEL IN A WORLD, YOU UNLOCKED TWO MORE LEVELS IN EACH OF THE SIX WORLDS. AND THESE LEVELS WERE EVEN HARDER THAN THE OTHERS!

I SPENT MANY HOURS 100%-ING MY YOSHI’S ISLAND CARTRIDGE AND THE SAVE STUCK WITH ME ALL THE WAY UNTIL AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT WHILE REVIEWING A CONTEMPORARY KNOCKOFF SUPER NINTENDO. I’VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED TO START OVER FROM SCRATCH.

DID YOU KNOW?
THERE WERE ONLY 48 LEVELS IN YOSHI'S ISLAND, HALF THAT OF SUPER MARIO WORLD.
IN THE LEVEL TOUCH FUZZY, GET DIZZY, THE DIZZYING, PSYCHEDELIC EFFECTS WERE CREATED BY THE SUPER FX2 CHIP.
THE CHARACTERS AND ART STYLE IN YOSHI'S ISLAND WERE REPURPOSED IN TETRIS ATTACK.

CHLOI RADTHE FIRST FOUR SILENT HILL GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME, BUT SILENT HILL 2 HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART. IT WAS THE FIRST SILENT HILL GAME TO ESTABLISH THE TOWN ITSELF AS A CHARACTER – IN A GENRE OVERSATURATED WITH RUN-OF-THE-MILL KILLERS, ZOMBIES, ALIENS, AND OTHER MORE CONVENTIONAL ADVERSARIES, SILENT HILL 2’S FOCUS ON HORROR IN ARCHITECTURE, IN THE LAYOUT AND PERSONALITY OF A SPACE, OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE TURNED TANGIBLE, WAS VASTLY MORE INTERESTING TO ME.

MOST OF ALL, IT WAS SCARY – LIKE, ACTUALLY SCARY: AN EXPLORATION OF THE DEPTHS OF HUMAN DEPRAVITY AND THE EFFECTS IT HAS ON THE PEOPLE AND PLACES AROUND US THAT FEW VIDEO GAMES HAVE HANDLED WITH SUCH A DISTURBING GRACE AND MATURITY. AS A HARDENED HORROR FAN WHO’S TOUGH TO FRIGHTEN, I APPRECIATE SILENT HILL 2’S ABILITY TO STICK WITH ME EVEN A DECADE LATER.

I MAY BE IMMUNE TO SILENT HILL 2’S SCARES NOW, HAVING SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WANDERING ITS FOGGY STREETS AND HAUNTED OTHERWORLDS, BUT I STILL REMEMBER ITS POWER THAT FIRST TIME I WALKED INTO TOWN.
