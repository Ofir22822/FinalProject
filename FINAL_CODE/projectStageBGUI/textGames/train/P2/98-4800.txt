LUKE REILLY2001’S GRAND THEFT AUTO III WAS A REAL WATERSHED IN THE HISTORY OF OPEN-WORLD GAMING. HOWEVER, PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS, RELEASED JUST THREE YEARS LATER, IS JUST HOW MUCH IT DWARFS GRAND THEFT AUTO III IN EVERY WAY.

FORGET ONE CITY. HAVE THREE, WITH VAST SWATHES OF FORESTS, COUNTRYSIDE, AND DESERT IN BETWEEN. WANT MORE VEHICLES? HAVE OVER 250 OF THEM, INCLUDING JUMP JETS, COMBINE HARVESTERS, LAWNMOWERS, BICYCLES, SEMI-TRAILERS, FORKLIFTS, AND SO, SO MANY MORE. MUSIC? NO PROBLEM. HOW DOES 11 RADIO STATIONS AND OVER 150 TRACKS SOUND?

NOT ENOUGH? HOW ABOUT PARACHUTES? HOW ABOUT A FUNCTIONING CASINO? HOW ABOUT A JETPACK? HOW ABOUT SAME-SCREEN FREE-ROAMING CO-OP? HOW ABOUT FAST FOOD THAT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU FAT? HOW ABOUT ARGUABLY THE GREATEST LINE-UP OF CHEATS EVER ASSEMBLED?

AND HOW ABOUT WE PUT SAMUEL L. JACKSON IN IT?

GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS WAS THE ALL-TIME BEST-SELLING GAME ON PLAYSTATION 2 – ITSELF THE BEST-SELLING CONSOLE OF ALL-TIME – AND IT’S JUST NOT AT ALL HARD TO SEE WHY.

DID YOU KNOW?
GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS CAME UNDER FIRE WHEN PLAYERS DISCOVERED A CUT SEX MINIGAME CALLED HOT COFFEE HIDDEN IN THE GAME FILES.
AFTER THE HOT COFFEE ORDEAL, ROCKSTAR OFFERED TO SWAP SAN ANDREAS COPIES FOR AN UPDATED VERSION AND $30 DOLLARS. ONLY 2,676 PEOPLE DID IT.

JON RYANBIOWARE HAS BUILT ITS REPUTATION ON CLASSIC RPGS, BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT ANY WILL REPRESENT ITS LEGACY AS WELL AS THE MASS EFFECT SERIES, AND THE ORIGINAL ME WAS AN ASTOUNDING INTRODUCTION TO THAT WORLD. WHO CAN FORGET THE FIRST TIME THEY OPENED THE GALAXY MAP OF THEIR VERY OWN STARSHIP NORMANDY FOR THE FIRST TIME OR THE OUTCOME OF THEIR STANDOFF WITH WREX? MASS EFFECT MANAGED TO CREATE AN INTRICATE NEW UNIVERSE AND FILL IT WITH COMPELLING LORE AND SECRETS TO DISCOVER, AND ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING CAMPAIGN ARCS OF A SCI-FI GAME TO DATE. WHILE LATER ENTRIES IN THE SERIES MAY HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER ON THE SEEDS PLANTED IN THIS FIRST CHAPTER, THE MOMENTOUS CHOICES THAT ME1 OFFERED US WERE - AND REMAIN - SOME OF THE MOST COMPELLING BRANCHING PLOT POINTS OUT THERE, ONES THAT WON'T BE FORGOTTEN ANY TIME SOON.

DID YOU KNOW?
MASS EFFECT'S ORIGINAL CODENAME WAS SFX, OR SCIENCE FICTION X, WHICH THE TEAM GREW SO ATTACHED TO THEY WANTED TO KEEP IT.

ALEX SIMMONSE3 2007 WAS MEMORABLE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRSTLY, IT MARKED A SHIFT AWAY FROM THE GLITZ AND GLAMOUR OF THE LOS ANGELES CONVENTION CENTER, MOVING TO THE MORE LOW-KEY SETTING IN NEARBY SANTA MONICA. SECONDLY, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME CALL OF DUTY 4 WAS SHOWN OFF, ITS MODERN-DAY SETTING A DRAMATIC DEPARTURE FROM THE WORLD WAR II BACKDROP OF PREVIOUS GAMES.

ALL GHILLIED UP WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF IT IN ACTION, AS TWO CAMOUFLAGED SNIPERS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH AN IRRADIATED PRIPYAT IN UKRAINE. THE HIGHLIGHT – NOT JUST OF THE DEMO BUT ARGUABLY OF THE ENTIRE GAME – WAS WATCHING, BREATH HELD, AS AN ENTIRE ARMOURED PATROL TRUNDLED PAST, INCHES FROM OUR HIDING SPOT, AND IT’S A MOMENT OF TENSION THAT’S NEVER BEEN MATCHED IN A SHOOTER SINCE.

ELECTRIC SET-PIECES AND SUPERB PACING MAKE MODERN WARFARE’S SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTERS EVER, BUT IT’S THE PERFECTLY BALANCED MULTIPLAYER THAT MADE IT THE DE RIGUEUR ONLINE GAME FOR YEARS TO FOLLOW. MULTIPLAYER SHOOTERS WERE NEVER THE SAME AGAIN.

DID YOU KNOW?
MODERN WARFARE WAS THE FIRST M-RATED CALL OF DUTY GAME.
THE RAP SONG THAT PLAYS OVER THE CREDITS WAS PERFORMED BY MARK GRIGSBY, THE GAME'S LEAD ANIMATOR.

BRENDAN GRAEBERAFTER ARKHAM ASYLUM LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR A SUPERHERO GAME THAT HIT ALL THE RIGHT BEATS, BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY TOOK EVERYTHING TO THE NEXT LEVEL BY LETTING BATMAN LOOSE IN THE STREETS OF GOTHAM (SORT OF). NOT ONLY DID IT NAIL THE FEELING OF STALKING AND BEATING DOWN THUGS WITH AN IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF GADGETS, IT RAISED THE STAKES OF WHAT A CAPED CRUSADER COULD DEAL WITH IN A SINGLE NIGHT.

ARKHAM CITY’S HEAPING HELPING OF INFAMOUS ROGUES LET YOU EXPERIENCE THEM IN THEIR ELEMENT, AND FOUND PERFECT WAYS FOR BATMAN TO FOIL THEM VIA BOTH BRAIN AND BRAWN – LEADING TO SOME OF THE BEST BOSS FIGHTS EVER CONCEIVED. EACH SUPERVILLAIN ADDED TO THE OPPRESSIVE WEIGHT OF TRYING TO SAVE THE DAY WITH THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST YOU, AND THE STORY’S CLIMAX REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING MOMENTS IN VIDEO GAMES.

SIMON CARDYTHE ISLAND SETTING OF THE WITNESS ENVELOPED ME IN ITS STRIKING COLOUR PALETTE AND MINIMALISTIC SOUNDSCAPE. WEAVED INTO THIS TRANQUIL SETTING HOWEVER IS A SERIES OF FIENDISH PUZZLES, EACH OFFERING A UNIQUE CHALLENGE. THESE PUZZLES HAD ME SCRAWLING PATTERNS ON PIECES OF GRAPH PAPER, REFLECTING THE SUN, AND LISTENING TO THE LOCAL WILDLIFE – I EXPLORED EVERY CORNER OF MY BRAIN, AND THIS ISLAND, IN SEARCH OF INCREASINGLY-EVASIVE SOLUTIONS.

THE FINAL CHALLENGE – A SEQUENCE OF 14 RANDOMLY GENERATED PROBLEMS THAT MUST BE SOLVED IN JUST UNDER SEVEN MINUTES – HAD ME QUESTIONING MY SANITY. BEING STUCK ON ONE PARTICULAR CONUNDRUM SEEMED FRUSTRATING AT THE TIME, BUT THAT ALL WASHED AWAY IN SENSE OF NEAR-UNPARALLELED EUPHORIA ONCE IT HAD BEEN SOLVED.

ALTHOUGH THE WITNESS DOESN’T OFFER A NARRATIVE IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE, THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT DOES NOT HAVE A STORY TO TELL. PHILOSOPHICAL METAPHORS AND ALLEGORICAL IMAGERY ARE LAYERED INTO THE WORLD, ALLOWING THE PLAYER TO DISCOVER AS MUCH MEANING AS THEY CARE TO. UNLIKE SO MANY GAMES THAT ARE DESPERATE TO HAND-HOLD AND DRIP-FEED, THE WITNESS HAS A REFRESHINGLY HIGH OPINION OF ITS PLAYER, EXPECTING THEM TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. IT’S WHAT MAKES THE WITNESS SO CHALLENGING BUT ALSO DEEPLY SPECIAL.

DID YOU KNOW?
THERE ARE ABOUT 650 PUZZLES IN THE WITNESS.
MANY OF THE ENVIRONMENTS WERE CREATED WITH THE HELP OF REAL ARCHITECTS AND LANDSCAPERS.

DANIEL KRUPAJOURNEY IS THE CLOSEST A VIDEO GAME HAS COME TO EMULATING THE EFFECTS OF POETRY. IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE IT’S SO SIMPLE: YOU MUST REACH A SNOWY MOUNTAIN PEAK VISIBLE IN THE DISTANCE. ALONG THE WAY, YOUR CHARACTER SURFS ACROSS GLISTENING DESERTS, HIDES FROM FLYING CREATURES MADE ENTIRELY FROM CLOTH, AND OCCASIONALLY MEETS OTHER PLAYERS EMBARKING ON THE SAME PILGRIMAGE.

JOURNEY HAS A UNIQUE AND SPECIAL TONE: IT’S DREAMLIKE AND MELANCHOLIC FOR THE MOST PART, BUT IT’S THE RAPTUROUS CONCLUSION WHICH TRULY ELEVATES IT. WORDS LIKE "BREATHTAKING" ARE USED SO LIBERALLY THEIR MEANING HAS BEEN HOLLOWED OUT, BUT JOURNEY DESERVES TO COMMAND ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE.

JOURNEY'S CORE DEVELOPMENT TEAM CONSISTED OF ONLY 18 PEOPLE.
ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR JENOVA CHEN, 25 PLAYTESTERS CRIED AFTER COMPLETING THE GAME.

DANIEL KRUPAMANY GAMES ATTEMPT TO EMULATE CINEMA, DEALING IN THE SAME TROPES AND STOCK CHARACTERS. INITIALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE UNCHARTED DOES THE SAME THING – IT FOCUSES ON A TREASURE HUNTER WHO FREQUENTLY FINDS HIMSELF IN DANGER ACROSS EXOTIC LOCATIONS. BUT WHEN YOU PLAY UNCHARTED, ESPECIALLY THE SECOND INSTALLMENT, AMONG THIEVES, YOU REALISE IT SURPASSES SO MUCH OF HOLLYWOOD’S RECENT OUTPUT WITH EASE.

SO OFTEN ACTION EXISTS FOR ACTION SAKE – TO LOOK COOL – BUT UNCHARTED 2: AMONG THIEVES USES IT TO REVEAL MORE ABOUT ITS CENTRAL CHARACTER, NATHAN DRAKE, AND HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH A STRONG CAST OF SUPPORTING CHARACTERS. THAT’S NOT TO SAY THE ACTION ISN’T SPECTACULAR. FROM BEING PURSUED BY A HELICOPTER ON A MOVING TRAIN TO BEING HARASSED BY AN ANGRY TANK IN A HIMALAYAN VILLAGE, UNCHARTED 2: AMONG THIEVES SET A NEW BENCHMARK FOR CINEMATIC ACTION, GRAPHICAL FIDELITY, AND ESTABLISHED NATHAN DRAKE AS ONE OF THE GREAT VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS OF HIS TIME.

JOE SKREBELSBLIZZARD PERFORMED ALCHEMY HERE. OVERWATCH SHOULD BE LEADEN – A TEAM FORTRESS COVER VERSION WITH TWO-AND-A-HALF MODES AND A MOBA APPROACH TO CHARACTER DESIGN. AND YET WHAT WE HAVE IS GOLD.

THE KEY HERE IS IN HOW BLIZZARD LOOKED BEYOND SIMPLY MAKING A GOOD SHOOTER – IT MADE AN INTERESTING ONE. ITS BACKSTORY IS PG-13 PIXAR, ITS CHARACTERS ARE DIVERSE AND LOVABLE, AND ITS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS… WELL, IT’S JEFF KAPLAN. PRO GAMERS, COSPLAYERS, FANFIC WRITERS, ARG DETECTIVES AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN HAVE ALL BEEN GIVEN A REASON TO PLAY A SINGLE GAME – NO MEAN FEAT.

AND THIS ISN’T TO PLAY DOWN THE GAME ITSELF – BLIZZARD DIDN’T MAKE A TEAM FORTRESS CLONE, IT MADE A SUCCESSOR. IT’S A SWIFT, SATISFYING SHOOTER, WITH A WHIRLING GAME-TO-GAME INTERNAL META OF CHARACTER PICKS AND COUNTER-PICKS. HOW MANY 30 MILLION-PLAYER GAMES HAVE A TUMBLR FOLLOWING AS POWERFUL AS THEIR ESPORTS SCENE? EXACTLY.

IT’S A SURPRISINGLY RICH AND JUICY MYSTERY THAT POSES INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AMID EVER-ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY.

BUILDING JC DENTON UP AS YOUR OWN CUSTOM-BUILT CYBORG SECRET AGENT IS A JOY, ALLOWING YOU TO MIX AND MATCH UPGRADES TO SUIT YOUR PLAYSTYLE ANYWHERE ON THE SPECTRUM OF ACTION TO STEALTH. THIS, NATURALLY, LEADS TO A GREAT DEAL OF REPLAYABILITY – NO MATTER WHAT AUGMENTATIONS YOU CHOOSE, DEUS EX’S LEVELS HAVE A DIFFERENT PATH THAT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED BY SOMEONE OF YOUR PARTICULAR SKILLS. YOU MIGHT FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH A GROUP OF ENEMIES, SNEAK PAST THEM UNDETECTED, OR HACK THEIR AUTOMATED GUN TURRET AND TURN IT AGAINST THEM. YOU MIGHT EVEN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE STORY WITHOUT HARMING A SOUL.

BRANDIN TYRRELBALDUR’S GATE II: SHADOWS OF AMN WAS VERY MUCH A LEADER OF THE PACK DURING THE RPG RENAISSANCE OF THE EARLY 2000S AND IS STILL AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THAT GENRE’S STRENGTHS. FROM ITS FANTASTICALLY WRITTEN CHARACTERS AND STORY TO ITS VAST ARSENAL OF WEAPONS, ARMORS, AND MAGIC, BALDUR’S GATE II WAS AN ADVENTURE THAT YOU COULD NOT ONLY GET LOST IN, BUT THAT COULD BE LIVED IN, SPENDING HUNDREDS OF HOURS EXPLORING EVERY HIDDEN SECRET AND MYSTERY.

BUT, PERSONALLY, BALDUR’S GATE II WAS A TRULY DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD AND RULES OF DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS. D&D VIDEO GAMES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIT-OR-MISS, AND AS A KID I WAS ENAMORED WITH GAMES LIKE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, BUT THESE VIRTUAL DUNGEON-CRAWLING ADVENTURES WERE A FAR CRY FROM THE REAL THING. BALDUR’S GATE II CHANGED THAT FOR ME, FINALLY MAKING GOOD ON THE DIGITAL PROMISE OF ITS TABLETOP ANCESTRY. AND THOUGH IT MAY BE A LITTLE DUSTY, IT’S STILL AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS WHEN THE SAGA OF THE BHAALSPAWN FIRST UNFOLDED.

DID YOU KNOW?
BALDUR'S GATE II'S IMMENSE SIZE – 300 TOTAL HOURS AND 290 QUESTS – MADE IT A "TESTER'S NIGHTMARE," SAID CO-EXECUTIVE PRODUCER RAY MUZYKA.

WE RUN AN OCCASIONAL HIGH SCORE COMPETITION AT IGN AND SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO BRING IT INTO OUR LUNCH ROOM FOR A BIT. FOR A MONTH, THE MACHINE WAS NEVER LEFT ALONE. WE WORK IN AN OFFICE SURROUNDED BY THE LATEST TOYS AND GAMES, BUT MS. PAC-MAN ATTRACTED CROWDS. PEOPLE CHANGED THEIR COMMUTES TO COME IN EARLY AND STAY LATE JUST TO PLAY. FREQUENTLY WE'D BE ACROSS THE OFFICE IN A CONFERENCE ROOM AND THE STRAINS OF THE MS. PAC-MAN CUTSCENE MUSIC WOULD WAFT OVER AND MAKE EVERYONE GIGGLE. THERE ARE VERY FEW GAMES WHICH CAN CREATE SO MUCH HAPPINESS AFTER SO MANY DECADES.

CHLOI RADCOUNTER-STRIKE IS THE GAME THAT’S BEEN WITH ME THE LONGEST, IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, BUT FOR ME, IT ALL STARTED HERE. MANY OF THE THINGS I VALUE MOST IN SKILL-BASED GAMES, I VALUE BECAUSE OF COUNTER-STRIKE: GOOD LEVEL DESIGN, TEAM-BASED DYNAMIC, THE DEDICATION REQUIRED TO MASTER IT, A FRIENDLY SENSE OF COMPETITION, AND A SOLID SENSE OF COMMUNITY. IT TAUGHT ME THE JOY OF EARNING MY VICTORIES IN A GAME, BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING FROM MY FAILURES. IT’S THE REASON I LOVE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTERS AND THE REASON I STUCK BY PC GAMING AT A YOUNG AGE, AND I OWE IT ALL TO ITS EARLIEST ITERATIONS.

DID YOU KNOW?
COUNTER-STRIKE WAS ORIGINALLY A HALF-LIFE MOD FROM 1999 BEFORE VALVE ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS FOR IT AND HIRED ITS CREATORS A YEAR LATER.
VALVE RELEASED THE FIRST RETAIL VERSION UNDER THE NAME HALF-LIFE: COUNTER-STRIKE, BELIEVING THE NAME COULDN'T STAND ON ITS OWN YET.

JOBERT ATIENZALEFT 4 DEAD 2 CAME OUT EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER THE ORIGINAL, WHICH UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO (INCORRECTLY) ASSUMED THE SEQUEL WOULD BE A GLORIFIED EXPANSION PACK TO THE FIRST. BUT LEFT 4 DEAD 2 DOES EXACTLY WHAT A SEQUEL NEEDS TO DO: BE BETTER IN EVERY WAY.

L4D2 - DEVELOPED IN-HOUSE AT VALVE - HAS MORE CREATIVE LEVELS IN ITS CAMPAIGN, MORE SPECIAL INFECTED TO KILL (OR PLAY AS, IF PLAYING IN VERSUS MODE), A BIGGER VARIETY OF WEAPONS, AND PROTAGONISTS WITH SOME ACTUAL PERSONALITY. EVEN THE SOURCE ENGINE, THOUGH ALREADY SHOWING ITS AGE WITH L4D1, LOOKED - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, PLAYED, - JUST FINE, CONSIDERING THE DOZENS OF RAVENOUS ZOMBIES THE GAME COULD THROW AT YOU AT ANY MOMENT.

THE SERIES’ A.I. DIRECTOR, WHICH IN THE FIRST GAME HANDLED HOW MANY ZOMBIES POUNCED ON YOU DEPENDING ON HOW WELL YOU’RE DOING, GOT AN UPGRADE. IT NOT ONLY CONTROLLED THE FLOW OF ZOMBIES, BUT WOULD TRY TO FORCE PLAYERS TO TAKE MORE DIFFICULT PATHS IN A LEVEL, AND REWARD PLAYERS WITH EXTRA HEALTH PACKS AND AMMO IF THEY WERE DOING WELL. THOUGH THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM WENT ON TO CREATE THE ASYMMETRICAL MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER EVOLVE, NOTHING HAS QUITE MATCHED THE VISCERAL THRILLS AND SCARES OF LEFT 4 DEAD 2, WHICH STANDS AS ONE OF THE PINNACLES OF MODERN CO-OP GAMING.

DID YOU KNOW?
EAGLE-EYED VIEWERS CAN SPOT A VIEW OF THE SPECIAL INFECTED FROM LEFT 4 DEAD IN THE FILM THE CABIN IN THE WOODS.
VALVE RELEASED AN EXTRA CAMPAIGN, “THE PASSING,” WHICH FEATURED CHARACTERS FROM LEFT 4 DEAD RUNNING INTO THE CAST FROM LEFT 4 DEAD 2. A SECOND DLC CAMPAIGN, “THE SACRIFICE,” WAS RELEASED FOR L4D1 AND ACTED AS A PREQUEL TO L4D2.
A GROUP OF UPSET LEFT 4 DEAD FANS ATTEMPTED TO BOYCOTT L4D2, OVER THE PERCEIVED “RUSHED” NATURE OF THE SEQUEL BEING RELEASED SO SOON AFTER THE FIRST GAME.

ANDREW GOLDFARBEARTHBOUND IS PROBABLY THE GAME THAT I RENTED THE MOST. I KNOW IT'S A WEIRD THING TO SAY, BUT I WAS A WEIRD KID BACK IN 1995, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY SHIGESATO ITOI'S RPG RESONATED SO HEAVILY WITH ME.

THE STORY OF NESS, PAULA, JEFF, AND POO'S JOURNEY ACROSS A STRANGE, SLANTED VERSION OF AMERICA WAS SUCH A VAST DEPARTURE FROM PREVIOUS RPGS I'D PLAYED LIKE FINAL FANTASY VI AND CHRONO TRIGGER. IT WASN'T DRENCHED IN FANTASY TROPES AND PATHOS, BUT RATHER BRIMMING WITH COLOR, HUMOR, AND SOME OF THE WEIRDEST CHARACTERS AND EVENTS I'D EVER SEEN IN A GAME. SIMULTANEOUSLY, IT KNOWS HOW TO PACK AN EMOTIONAL PUNCH.

SO YEAH, I RENTED IT. OBVIOUSLY, IT DIDN'T COME WITH THE PACK-IN PLAYER'S GUIDE, SO I ONLY MADE IT SO FAR BEFORE I HAD TO RETURN IT. THEN I RENTED IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN. EVENTUALLY, MY PARENTS NOTICED THAT MY COLLEGE FUND WAS BEING GIVEN TO BLOCKBUSTER, SO THEY NIPPED THE PROBLEM IN THE BUD AND BOUGHT IT FOR ME. IT'S BEEN MY FAVORITE JRPG EVER SINCE.

CHLOI RADRESIDENT EVIL WAS NOT ONLY AN IMPRESSIVELY FAITHFUL REMAKE OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GAMES EVER MADE – IT MANAGED TO SURPASS THE BASE MATERIAL IN ALMOST EVERY WAY, CARVING OUT AN IDENTITY ALL ITS OWN WITHOUT SACRIFICING AN OUNCE OF THE ORIGINAL'S CREATIVE VISION. RETREADING EVEN THE MOST FAMILIAR PATHS THROUGH THE SPENCER MANSION'S MANY HALLWAYS AND ROOMS FELT LIKE A FRESH EXPERIENCE WITH ITS HIGHLY DETAILED, GOTHIC ART DIRECTION. THE CLASSIC PUZZLE-HEAVY HORROR AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT WERE REVAMPED RATHER THAN ABANDONED, POLISHED UP FOR A NEW GENERATION OF PLAYERS WITHOUT SCORNING THE OLD. AND YET IT WAS THE BOLD NEW ADDITIONS THAT ENDED UP AS SOME OF RESIDENT EVIL'S MOST ICONIC ELEMENTS: THE OTHERWORLDLY GROANING BEYOND THAT MYSTERIOUS GATE BEHIND THE STAIRS, AND THE TERRIFYING SUBVERSION OF THE ORIGINAL GAME'S FAITHFUL PROMISE – THAT THE ZOMBIES YOU KILL WILL STAY DEAD. RESIDENT EVIL'S REANIMATED ZOMBIES AND VICIOUS CRIMSON HEADS BROUGHT A FRIGHTENING INTENSITY TO THE GHOSTLY HALLS OF THE MANSION, UPPING THE STAKES IN A WHOLE NEW WAY AND BRINGING A NEW DIMENSION TO THE CORE ELEMENTS THAT DRIVE THE SERIES: EXPLORATION, COMBAT, AND STRATEGIC ITEM MANAGEMENT. WHILE THE SERIES HAS TAKEN MANY TURNS, FEW GAMES IN THE SERIES HAVE COME CLOSE TO BEING AS PERFECT AS THIS ONE.

DID YOU KNOW?
SHINJI MIKAMI, THE ORIGINAL RESIDENT EVIL DIRECTOR, WANTED TO CREATE A REMAKE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THE ORIGINAL'S GRAPHICS HAD AGED WELL.

CAM SHEAI CAME TO THE DIABLO II PARTY INCREDIBLY LATE. THE FIRST TIME I ACTUALLY PLAYED IT PROPERLY WAS IN 2011, MORE THAN TEN YEARS AFTER ITS INITIAL RELEASE. COULD THIS ICONIC GAME POSSIBLY LIVE UP TO MY LOFTY EXPECTATIONS THAT LATE IN THE DAY? ABSOLUTELY. IN FACT, I WAS SURPRISED BY JUST HOW GOOD IT WAS. AFTER ALL, DIABLO II DOESN’T EXACTLY GO OUT OF ITS WAY TO BE USER-FRIENDLY. EVEN CHOOSING A CLASS AND BUILD IS DAUNTING, LET ALONE LEARNING THE QUIRKS OF ITS MANY SYSTEMS.

WHAT HOOKS YOU IN, HOWEVER, IS JUST HOW PERFECTLY MEASURED THE CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP OF KILLING, LOOTING AND UPGRADING IS. WHETHER YOU’RE JUST STARTING OUT OR WADING THROUGH HELL WITH A HARDCORE CHARACTER, DIABLO II HAS A MOMENTUM THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE SWEPT UP IN. THE ODDS ARE ALWAYS OVERWHELMING, THE ATMOSPHERE ALWAYS MALEVOLENT, AND THE REWARD ALWAYS WORTH THE RISK.

AND AS IS TYPICAL OF BLIZZARD AS A STUDIO, DIABLO II CAN BE PLAYED ON COUNTLESS DIFFERENT LEVELS. I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED MOST OF WHAT THE GAME HAD TO OFFER, BUT ULTIMATELY I DIDN’T NEED TO. THE SIMPLE JOY OF WADING THROUGH THICK KNOTS OF ENEMIES WITH MY NECROMANCER AND HIS SUMMONED BROOD OF SKELETONS AND MAGES, SETTING OFF CHAINS OF CORPSE EXPLOSIONS AND PAINTING THE WORLD RED WAS AN END GAME IN ITSELF.

DESTIN LEGARIECUTSCENES WERE ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF PC GAMING IN THE LATE '90S AND BLIZZARD WAS REGARDED AS THE KING WHEN IT CAME TO JAW-DROPPING VISUALS. THEY TOOK THINGS TO AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL WITH STARCRAFT AND THE BROOD WAR EXPANSION IN 1998, THOUGH. NOT ONLY WERE PLAYERS TREATED TO AN EXCELLENT RTS EXPERIENCE, BUT THEIR REWARD FOR COMPLETING SECTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN WERE EVOCATIVE VISUALS THAT FURTHER IMMERSED YOU IN A WORLD WHERE HUMANS ARE LOSING A WAR AGAINST BRUTAL SPACE ALIENS.

TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER, THOSE CUTSCENES WERE PAIRED WITH SOME TRULY TALENTED VOICE ACTING AND NARRATIVE DESIGN. AS I PLAYED THROUGH THE STORYLINE I LEARNED TO LOVE THE DIFFERENT LITTLE CHARACTERS I INTERACTED WITH AND FELT GENUINE ANGER WHEN THE ZERG MANAGED TO CAPTURE KERRIGAN AND BEND HER TO THEIR WILL. THIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN WITH YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN AND AFTER SHE'S CAPTURED YOU, OF COURSE, BEGIN THE MISSION TO RESCUE HER.

STILL, THE HIGHLIGHT OF STARCRAFT IS EASILY ITS MULTIPLAYER. FEW GAMING MOMENTS ARE AS SATISFYING AS DEFENDING YOUR BASE AGAINST A ZERG RUSH AS THE PROTOSS OR SUCCESSFULLY SENDING IN A FLEET OF TERRAN TO DECIMATE AN ENEMY'S BASE. STARCRAFT IS STILL PLAYED COMPETITIVELY IN PARTS OF THE WORLD, MAKING IT REMAIN RELEVANT FOR LONGER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER VIDEO GAME IN EXISTENCE. THERE'S A REASON TOO. IT'S BECAUSE THE GAMEPLAY IS SO EXPERTLY CRAFTED AND BALANCED THAT PLAYERS CAN CONTINUALLY GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT EACH TIME. IT'S THOSE NEAR LOSSES AND PHOTO FINISH VICTORIES THAT KEEP YOU COMING BACK AND HAVE KEPT THE SERIES ALIVE ALL THESE YEARS.

MARK MEDINAIN A UNIVERSE WHERE EVERQUEST WAS KING, AND MMOS SEEMED LIKE A DOMINATED MARKET, LEAVE IT UP TO BLIZZARD TO TURN ONE OF THEIR KEY FRANCHISES INTO THE BIGGEST MMO THERE EVER WAS, AND POSSIBLY EVER WILL BE. AFTER SIX EXPANSIONS, WORLD OF WARCRAFT HAS SHOWN VERY LITTLE SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. OF COURSE, THE PLAYER-BASE HAS ALWAYS FLUCTUATED, BUT THE MASSIVE HYPE AROUND A BRAND NEW EXPANSION IS ALWAYS ENOUGH TO BRING EVEN THE MOST RETIRED PLAYER BACK FOR MORE.

I BELIEVE THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC THAT DRAWS PEOPLE TO THE GAME IS THE FREEDOM TO PLAY THE GAME AS YOU SEE FIT. LIKE GROUPING WITH FRIENDS? IF SO, THE GAME GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO START WITH A CREW AND PLAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE GAME TOGETHER, REGARDLESS OF RACE OR CLASS. WANT TO MAKE A GO AT IT SOLO? THEN FEEL FREE TO TAKE ON QUESTS ALONE. THE HIGHER LEVEL DUNGEONS AND RAIDS DEMAND TEAMWORK, BUT WITH ITS STELLAR LOOKING FOR GROUP SYSTEM, FINDING PEOPLE TO TACKLE A HARD BOSS HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER.

IT’S ALWAYS WORTH MENTIONING THE WARRING FACTIONS OF THE ALLIANCE AND HORDE. WHILE CHOOSING A FACTION SEEMS A TAD MORE MEANINGLESS THAN IT USED TO, MAINLY BECAUSE THE FACTIONS BASICALLY ARE TASKED WITH THE SAME THINGS, THE OLD DAYS OF CROSSROADS AND TARREN MILL ARE MEMORIES SOME PLAYERS WILL HAVE FOREVER.

AND SO WE GOT REVAN AND ONE OF THE BEST TWISTS IN GAMING HISTORY, AND WE GOT THE DARK WIT OF ROBOT PARTY MEMBER HK-47. BEST OF ALL, WE GOT A STAR WARS STORY WHERE YOUR CHOICES TRULY MATTERED. CHOOSING TO DOUBLE-CROSS SOMEONE YOU'D AGREED TO HELP WOULD EARN YOU DARK SIDE POINTS, AND EVENTUALLY YOU COULD BECOME TRULY EVIL AND SADISTICALLY POWERFUL. BUT SO TOO COULD YOUR BENEVOLENT ACTIONS BRING YOU TO THE LIGHT SIDE AND MAKE YOU A VIRTUOUS HERO.

DID YOU KNOW?
KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC IS SET 4,000 YEARS BEFORE THE EVENTS OF THE STAR WARS FILMS.
