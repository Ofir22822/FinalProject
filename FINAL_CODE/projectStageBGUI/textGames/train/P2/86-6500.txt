The Best Puzzle Games

Perfect for when you want to kill some time, puzzle games are a dime a dozen on the Play Store and some of them are even good. Some make you think or work to get your mind around their core concepts. Puzzle games keep you interested and entertained by forcing you to pay attention, even it's just something as simple as noticing which color is coming next. It's not hard to see why they're so popular with many mobile gamers.

Bridge Constructor Portal

Bridge Constructor Portal is, in my opinion, the best of the series. Not only do you get the excellent gameplay that the games are known for, but you get some quirky crossover stuff from Valve's classic Portal. You need to contend with the laws of physics, yes, but also some "goodies" from the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. It's a hoot.

The gist of the game remains the same: build structures that are capable of carrying a vehicle from Point A to Point B. Sounds easy, but there's really a lot of strategy to it. In addition, you'll have to deal with things like portals, repulsion and propulsion gels, cubes, and an assortment of other Portal-themed stuff.

GLaDOS is even here! I'm telling you, if you loved Portal like a lot of us did, and you like physics-based puzzles, you'll love this game. It plays great on tablets and there's also gamepad support. It's just a downright good game and it's worth every penny.


Bridge Constructor Portal
A fantastic mishmash of traditional Bridge Constructor gameplay and elements from the hit Portal, this game is a must for fans of either (or both!) series. It's a premium title that's so much fun to play.

Chameleon Run

Published by the fine folks at Noodlecake Games, Chameleon Run is an auto-runner that tests your reaction time in ways that may hurt your brain a bit.

The name of the game is speed as you jump and dash across colored platforms. You have special jump skills and the ability to change color, and you've got to make it through each course but you're only allowed to touch objects that match your color. Seem easy enough? Well, think again!

As pretty as the game looks when it's running at full frame rate the real joy comes from the precise input on the two-touch controls. If you time a color switch just when you touch the platform you get a quick dash boost. Jump controls are equally precise and allow you to nail tricky double jumps with ease. Each level is designed to be non-linear, meaning there are multiple paths to take to make it to the finish, however, there are also three special objectives to complete for each level which will keep you coming back for more.

Overall, the game is pretty short, but it's designed to be one of those games that's ideal for speedrunning — although there's already some stiff competition out there. I feel like the game is missing one knock out feature — a course editor that allows players to upload their own levels. Or simply more levels perhaps with platforms of even more different colors to swap between. Still, for $2 it's one hell of a fun game.


Chameleon Run
Chameleon Run is a colorful endless runner that challenges you with precise jumps and quick reflexes to be sure you don't touch the wrong platform and blow yourself up.

Holedown

It's hard to find a fun puzzle game that doesn't try to sell you on power-ups or extra lives or something.

That's just one of the reasons why Holedown is a standout game in 2018. Holedown will have you strategically blasting through to the core of celestial bodies — starting with asteroids and working your way up to the Sun — using the classic gaming formula of bouncing balls off blocks. Each brick has a number that represents the number of hits needed to destroy it, or you can destroying a supporting block clear out everything above it.

This is a pick-up-and-play game that's an easy concept to grasp but you quickly learn there's an amount of strategy and skill involved. All the bricks are curved, allowing you to set up tricky bank shots to clear out massive sections of blocks in one go. This will become quite important as the screen move up one row after every shot. If the blocks reach the top of the screen, it's game over.

Along the way, you will collect crystals which you spend on upgrades that give you more balls per shot, and more shots per round. These upgrades are crucial to completing the later planets but also let the earlier levels become more of a mindless distraction for your subway commute. All told, it won't take you too long to max out all your stats in Holedown, but that's mostly because it's so hard to stop playing this game once you start.

If you're a fan of physics-based puzzle games and are looking for a new obsession, Holedown is well worth your money!


Holedown
Holedown is a clever take on the ball and brick genre where you launch balls to excavate down to the core of asteroids, planets and stars. It offers simple gameplay while delivering an endless challenge mode.

Monument Valley 1 & 2

Yep, I'm cheating again, but only because I adore both of these games so much. I'd be hard-pressed to say which is my favorite: the original or the one that expanded upon the core concepts? Since I can't decide, you get both of them here.

Odds are, you've at least heard of Monument Valley before. It's popular for a reason with its timeless gameplay, beautiful art design (that's frequently copied), and minimalist story. Rearrange the fantastical architecture, enjoy the surrealism and ambiance, and immerse yourself in guiding the silent princess to her goal. In the sequel, do more of the same, but on a larger scale.

I don't find that's much more to say. If you're a fan of puzzles and you haven't tried out Monument Valley, then I highly recommend that you do so.


Monument Valley
Considered now to be one of the best puzzle games around, Monument Valley forces you to think outside of the box to reach your goal.


Monument Valley 2
Expanding on the concepts presented by its predecessor, Monument Valley 2 returns with the same gameplay that many loved with the original. Guide a mother and her daughter through the valley as you take on new puzzles.

The Room: Old Sins

The Room: Old Sins is the latest epic puzzle game from Fireproof Games and the 4th in the award-winning 'The Room' puzzle game series. You are exploring the home of an ambitious engineer who has gone missing when you find a rather peculiar dollhouse in the attic.

Using a sophisticated eyepiece you're able to explore different rooms in the dollhouse that are filled with incredibly sophisticated puzzle boxes and contraptions. There's something really weird going on here, so maybe if you can solve all the puzzles you'll figure out what happened to the missing engineer and his wife.

If you've never played a game from "The Room" series before, just get ready for one of the more engrossing games you'll ever play on a mobile phone. The graphics and audio come together to create a wonderfully creepy vibe as you carefully inspect intricate objects and unlock secrets to help you on your journey.

If you want to catch up with the other games, you can snag The Room, The Room Two, and The Room 3 at discounted prices.


The Room: Old Sins
The Room series offers some of the most beautiful gaming experiences on mobile. Solve intricate puzzles and unlock the secrets hidden within these mysterious contraptions.

Thumper: Pocket Edition

Another excellent game that made its way to Android, Thumper: Pocket Edition is one of the weirdest gaming experiences you can have on your phone. It's a rhythm game, or "rhythm violence" as the developers call it, filled with intense speed and grueling boss battles.

Thumper also contains elements of fear, a constant sense of impending dread, as you hurtle forward and trust in your reflexes. With the incredible soundtrack pounding in your ears, Thumper is sure to give a euphoria unlike any other. Despite the creepy and sometimes eldritch set pieces, Thumper's premise is simple: you're a space beetle trying to destroy a floating head.

There are nine levels for you to enjoy, a new game+ mode that increases the challenge and speed, and the original soundtrack I mentioned. It's $5 well-spent, complete with a constant and smooth framerate. The developers do warn that wireless headphones add significant audio latency, so use your phone's or tablet's speakers or wired headphones if you can.


Thumper: Pocket Edition
Hurtle forward at blistering speed as you take on the role of a space beetle. Enjoy the gorgeous design, excellent soundtrack, and addicting gameplay while you're at it.

Transmission

Transmission is a wonderful puzzle game that is calming while still being complex and difficult at times. It's almost always installed on my phone at any given moment for when I'm bored somewhere and want something to fill the brief window I might have.

The goal of Transmission is to create various networks that get increasingly more involved as you go along. It's beautiful in its simplicity, both in its art style and its overall premise. Each puzzle is a visual representation of a network. You start with a basic one, and your goal is to make connections. The different puzzles will challenge you to make these connections in different ways and configurations, including avoiding obstacles.

The other awesome thing about Transmission is that it is 100% free without any gimmicks, just good ol' logic puzzle fun to get you through a tough or boring day. The visuals are gorgeous and the music is amazing. This is a game you have to try.


Transmission
Transmission is a puzzle game about connecting different networks. You'll be faced with more and more complexity as you go along, but nothing ever gets stressful.

Vectronom

I love finding the quirky indie titles that always manage to fall into the cracks of the Google Play Store, not receiving the promotion and attention that they rightfully deserve. Vectronom falls into that category, delivering a captivating experience that merges level design and music together to create a puzzle platformer that you play as much with your ears as you do with your fingertips.

Vectronom is, at times, a psychedelic experience given the flashing colors and thumping electronic soundtrack designed to entrance you as you play. Each level changes to the beat of the music, and the game grades you on how well your cube's movement follows the rhythm. The game was previously released on Steam and for the Nintendo Switch, and while the game no doubt controls way better with a keyboard or controller D-pad I've had no issues with the touch screen controls that rely on swipes and taps.

As straight forward as the concept is here, you will be challenged by the complexity of the levels as you progress through the game. There are currently 31 levels available to play through, each with their own theme introducing new traps to dodge and level mechanics to master. The indie developers behind the game hope to continue to build out the game's content by taking music submitted by users and designing new levels around those tracks. While the game does incentivize you to revisit levels and try and beat them clean in one try or better sync your moves to the beat of the music, I'd absolutely love to see a community build around Vectronom that delivers more puzzles which are perfect for mobile play.


Vectronom
Vectronom is a psychedelic puzzle platformer where you'll need to stick with the beat if you want to succeed and solve each colorful level.

The Best Platformers

A very generic category, even more so than RPGs, platformers are generally 2D, but "platformer" just tells you how the game plays. There are action RPG platformers, metroidvanias, and so on. It's a classic style of game for a reason and it translates extremely well to mobile.

Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
Symphony Of The Night Hero
Source: Android Central/Jordan Palmer

Coming out of left field, Konami's classic Castlevania: Symphony of the Night launched on mobile in early March to the joy and surprise of many. I purchased it immediately and you can read my thoughts on it here. It's one of the best $3 I've ever spent in the Play Store. Despite having a massive backlog of other games to get to, I spent a fair chunk of time reliving my childhood.

Besides just the charm and nostalgia, Symphony of the Night plays excellently on Android. The touchscreen controls are fine and certainly workable, but I found the game to be best played with a controller. The team behind the port did a great job with translating a very old game to a new platform and, while I had some gripes with them, the touchscreen controls let anyone hop in. Otherwise, any gamepad that works with Android should do just fine here (I used the Xbox One controller). Those of you with high refresh rate displays may notice some weirdness with the game and the developers advise using 60Hz — though they only specifically mention the Pixel 4 and Smooth Display.

Symphony of the Night is a classic, having helped define a whole new genre of game that we still see to this day. You follow Alucard, the son of Dracula, as he looks for the missing Richter. Wander the mysterious and dangerous castle as you find new abilities, unlock shortcuts, and become more powerful. You can also play as Richter himself (up until you meet a certain character) and Maria by entering their names when starting a new save. Add that to the achievement system and you have a bunch of content to work through. Seriously, this is $3 well-spent.

All we need now is Super Metroid on Android. Come on, Nintendo.


Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
There's a lot of hubbub around the mobile release of Symphony of the Night for good reason. A lot more people can now experience this fantastic game in its revised glory.

Dandara

Coming back to the last decade, we have a game that took some of the core concepts from Symphony of the Night and put its own spin on it. Meet Dandara, a beautiful and incredibly engaging metroidvania. As you might expect from the genre, there's plenty of solitary exploration as you work to make our heroine more powerful for the trials ahead.

Dandara tells the story of a woman who fight to stave off her world's impending collapse. Travel throughout it, meet interesting characters, and survive against the challenges that await you. Defy gravity as you explore a unique world and discover its mysteries. It's a fantastic game.

Better yet, it just got a free expansion called the Trials of Fear which adds a new boss, areas, and power-ups. It's a lot of game for $6 and worth it if you like metroidvanias.


Dandara
A fantastic metroidvania, Dandara is well worth the time and investment if you're looking for a great game to play on your phone.

Dead Cells

I've been looking forward to this release since the news first dropped. Dead Cells is one of my favorite indie games to come out in recent years, and it's now available on Android. A brutally challenging roguelike metroidvania, Dead Cells is an amalgam of several different types of games and it's glorious.

The Android port is excellent with tight controls (though they take some getting used to). Best of all, if you don't like the touch controls, there's controller support. It's the same experience as on any other platform and there's not much else to say, but that's a good thing. Dead Cells is worth every penny.

Dead Cells features permadeath, but don't let that deter you. You'll need to learn your enemies' patterns to best them in the crazy combat. The combat itself is varied and there are tons of different builds to suit every player. Dead Cells is a premium title that is albeit pricey for a mobile game, but like I said above, it's worth every cent.


Dead Cells
The amazing Dead Cells has come to Android and it's awesome. This is one of the best games available on the Play Store right now.

Grimvalor

Stepping away from metroidvanias, we have Grimvalor, an action RPG platformer. This is my go-to game right now because of its addicting gameplay and interesting premise. Combat is slick, movement is excellent, and it just works so well. Seriously, I play this game all the time when I'm out and about.

You need be tactical about how you approach enemies and level your character. There's plenty to explore, too, with secrets hidden throughout the map. I really enjoy the combat and it feels so good and satisfying, especially when you dodge just right and your character does an awesome flip.

You get the first act for free, after which you need to fork over $7 for the full game. I like this tactic; it lets you experience the game as it is and then you have the choice to pay to continue. Go ahead and give it a try to see if you like it.


Grimvalor
Grimvalor fills that action RPG itch while being a fun platformer. Enjoy the excellent combat and exploration. You even get a trial demo before purchasing.

GRIS

Gris is an emotional journey through a young girl's personal trauma. It's a calming game meant to make you feel something, whether that's through the gameplay itself, the incredible art design, or the wonderful soundtrack. Combine all of those together and you get one powerful experience.

The story isn't told through text, dialogue, or cutscenes. Instead, you're left to ponder and to figure out what's going on using your own viewpoint; everyone gets something different out of Gris. Almost everything about this game is a masterpiece, even down to the animations. You'll be solving some simple puzzles, tackling some platforming, and other challenges to guide Gris through her journey.

There isn't any combat or death in this game. It's a $5 well-spent and one I highly recommend to anyone looking for an evocative experience. Like I said, everyone gets something different out of this game. I personally was blown away by the art and music — your experience will be completely different than mine.


GRIS
Enjoy a game that ticks a lot of boxes: beautiful art, smooth gameplay, great soundtrack. There's a lot to get out of Gris, and I think anyone can find something to like.

Human: Fall Flat

Sometimes, you just need a little whimsy in your life. Such is the case with Human: Fall Flat, a hilarious physics puzzle platformer! You play as a wobbly humanoid as you explore 12 levels filled with challenging puzzles. You can go it alone, with friends, or complete strangers.

The draw of Human: Fall Flat is that you can grab just about anything. You can climb anything, throw anything, carry anything as you move forward in a manner that we'll loosely call "straight." While you may be aiming for the goal, your companions may instead be plotting some nefarious mayhem to sow chaos. Whatever the outcome, it's a really fun time.

Human: Fall Flat is a one-time purchase with no ads or microtransactions. It's wonderfully fun and worth the $5, especially if you join up with others.


Human: Fall Flat
Enjoy this hilariously fun puzzle platformer. It's got tons of puzzles and wonky physics to keep entertained for quite a while.

LIMBO

If you're looking for a fun and yet incredibly creepy platformer, then Limbo is a must. This shadowy game will give you the heebie-jeebies more than once. With such wonderful quirks, Limbo is delightfully weird. If you've played it before, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

The art style alone is worth picking up the game for. It's something we've seen other indie games try to replicate, but like other trendsetters, Limbo is in a league of its own. The shadowy and minimalist aesthetic is beautiful and really lends to the otherwordly feeling you get from the game (thus the name Limbo).

The story is also minimalistic, where you play the role of a nameless boy caught on the edge of hell. Arachnophobes, beware! The boy seeks his lost sister, but the journey is the fun part. Limbo is desolate, with few friendly human characters. It's really quite the experience. You can try out a free demo before you purchase, which I advise doing.


LIMBO
Limbo made a name for itself with its creepy and disturbing atmosphere, notably disturbing arachnophobes. It can be downright horrifying and lonely, but it's worth it, even if the ending is polarizing.

Oddmar

Of all the games I've played in 2019, Oddmar stands out as one of my absolute favorites in part because it's absolutely gorgeous from its opening sequence through its beautifully animated levels that show a depth of detail you rarely see in a mobile game. I'm also somewhat biased because I absolutely adore well-crafted indie platformers but Oddmar still stands out for having a great protagonist and excellent story to tell.

You play as Oddmar, an exiled Viking who never quite lived up to his warrior ancestor who is granted special powers by a magical fairy. The timing is just right, as Oddmar has an opportunity to redeem himself by going on a journey of redemption.

Overall, the level design is pretty linear but never feels stale thanks to the good variety of enemies to bounce off of and the unique obstacles and some quick puzzles to solve to progress. On top of all that, Oddmar also comes across these hallucination-like Valhalla challenges that are mixed into most levels. These challenge you with a quick scrolling bonus level that add some really nice gameplay variety.

Touchscreen controls for platforming games are notoriously difficult to get right on mobile, but then a game like Oddmar comes along and shows the industry just how it's done. Everything feels just right with the left side of the screen controlling your horizontal movement and the right side dedicated to jumping, attacking, ground-pounding, and dash attacks.

You're able to play the first section of the game for free with the rest of the game unlocked with a one-time in-app payment of $5 — well worth it for one of the best games you'll play on your phone.


Oddmar
Oddmar is a beautiful game that plays like a living comic book. You can play through the first chapter for free and then, once you've fallen in love with it, unlock the rest of the game for $5.

Suzy Cube

If the 2D platformers don't do it for you, then might I interest you in a 3D one? Suzy Cube is a fun adventure that spans many levels, each one a new challenge to master. With gamepad support, Suzy Cube promises many hours of platforming fun. Locate power-ups and master the levels in order to recover your castle's stolen gold.

It reminds me of the 3D Mario games in spirit, though I had some trouble getting used to the touchscreen controls. Moving to a controller, however, made me enjoy this game a whole lot more. While this sort of thing doesn't capture my attention for too long, I had fun. It's certainly a light-hearted adventure.


Suzy Cube
Enjoy a bright 3D platforming adventure in Suzy Cube. Reclaim your castle's stolen riches as you master each level and collect new power-ups.

The Best Strategy Games

Similar to puzzle games, strategy games require your attention and willpower to succeed. Whether managing a kingdom or battling seemingly impossible odds, strategy games can certainly push you. Approach cautiously and you'll be just fine.

Among Us

To say that Among Us has exploded in popularity recently would be underselling the game. I see tons of memes that originated from it and a lot of people looking for others who also play. It's a cute, fun, and interesting multiplayer game that supports 5-10 players where not everyone is as they seem.

Your group is meant to complete various space-y tasks, but amongst you is an imposter hell-bent on killing everyone. He or she will use sabotage things to sow chaos and throw you off. This chaos can mask the murders and/or create alibis for the imposter.

To win in Among Us depends on if you're a regular crewmate or the imposter. For the former, all you need to do is complete the tasks at hand or figure out the imposter and vote them off the ship. If you're the imposter, you need to successfully kill everyone undetected. Among Us is a ton of fun to play, though the very deceptive nature of it might strain some friendships!


Among Us
This co-op/competitive game is a blast. Survive the imposter who's determined to kill the entire crew; or, use stealth and chaos to slaughter everyone without being caught.

Bad North: Jotunn Edition

Bad North is a real-time roguelike strategy game where you're protecting your little island kingdom from the Norse horde. All of that to say, it's a fresh challenge each time you pick it up and man, is it a fun game. I'm not usually one for this type of thing, but I love Bad North on PC and it's an excellent addition to the Play Store.

These evil Vikings will come at you fast and they'll hit you hard. The AI is really clever, too, so it will often sneak by your defenses. The Vikings will burn and pillage, and get more advanced the more successful you are. Just wait until the long-range Norsemen appear. The goal is to survive each encounter, ensuring that commander of each troop unit lives to see another battle. Squads who are completely wiped out are dead for the rest of the campaign.

Bad North is a fantastic game and it looks great, too, with its minimalist, cutesy art style. I think it's well worth the $5 to get in, because it's practically endless fun since things are changed up each time you play. It's a one-time upfront cost with no additional ads or microtransactions, just good, old-fashioned fun.


Bad North: Jotunn Edition
Survive the Viking onslaught in this procedurally-generated, real-time strategy roguelike. There's something new every time.

Exploding Kittens

There are some truly ridiculous games in this world, but few can top the hilarity of Exploding Kittens. Just the name alone makes me chuckle. It's an over-the-top multiplayer card game with some funny art and plenty of laughs for you and your friends. What else do you need?

Okay, fine. Exploding Kittens is all about luck. You and the other players draw cards until someone, hopefully not you, draws the Exploding Kitten card. From that point on, that player's time is limited until he or she can Defuse the angry feline. Defuse cards come in a variety of distractions; regardless, you don't want the kitten to blow up because that'll knock you out of the game.

Otherwise, you're just playing on borrowed time. It's a great time and fun for the whole family — I love Cards Against Humanity, but it isn't exactly the most kid-friendly game out there. Exploding Kittens is a mere $2 purchase and it's yours for good. You can also play online with strangers.


Exploding Kittens
Draw cards until someone pulls the Exploding Kitten card. Hopefully it's not you, otherwise you need to defuse the cat before you're knocked out the game!

Gwent

Gwent has been around for a few years now. First starting as a mini-game in the incredible masterpiece The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Gwent became a favorite pastime for many players. CD Projekt Red eventually spun Gwent out into its own thing, complete with some nice visual overhauls and online matchmaking. And now it's available on Android. Although it's a substantial download from the Play Store, boy howdy is it worth it.

Card games could technically be classed as their own thing, but one could also make an argument that most of them involve a lot of strategy. Gwent is one such example, requiring you to pay attention to your cards, their abilities, their placement on the game mat, and your score. That's not to mention keeping in mind what your opponent is doing and what they've played. All told, Gwent has a lot going on and requires your utmost attention.

Here's how it works. You go against another player using your chosen deck, from which you draw cards at the beginning of a round. You have the option to redraw up to three cards. Each match consists of three rounds and the player who wins two of them is the victor. Success is determined by having the highest score, which comes from the point values assigned to each card in play. Some cards also have unique abilities that can help you or hinder your opponent. And sometimes, victory requires you to throw a round to be ready for the next one. There's a lot more to it than that, but the nuance is simply too much for this list.

This is one of those great free-to-play games that I highly recommend you try out. There are microtransactions, sure, but CD Projekt Red has built enough of a good reputation with the gaming community that I don't think many people mind. Overall, it's an excellent and very addicting game. The Android version also has cross-play with iOS and PC players, greatly expanding the pool of people against whom you can play.


Gwent
Gwent is a fun and addicting card game that recently landed on Android. Best two out of three wins, but it takes a lot of strategy to get there.

Hearthstone

Ah, Hearthstone. It's a massively popular card game, partly because it's free to get started and partly because it taps into Blizzard's beloved Warcraft universe. Hearthstone pits you against another player in 1v1 combat, where your goal is to knock down their health pool to 0 before they do the same to you. With all of the expansions, there's a lot of variety and deck build diversity to be had.

Casual online games, ranked matches, wacky weekly Tavern Brawls, and grueling Arena games appeal to varying levels of player commitment, as you build your deck and your best strategies.

Hearthstone is without a doubt the king of free card games on Android, going head-to-head with Legends of Runeterra and Gwent. It's been around long enough to have a ton of content for newer players to discover, although there's a lot of in-app purchases for unlocking new card expansions. Even so, it's a fun game for players of all skill levels and worth the time to play.


Hearthstone
Hearthstone is one of the biggest digital card games you can play on Android. Based on the Warcraft universe, it has a really high skill ceiling while being accessible for new players.

Legends of Runeterra

Legends of Runeterra is to League of Legends as Hearthstone is to Warcraft. It's another turn-based card game based on a wildly popular universe. Though I've never played League of Legends myself, I can understand and appreciate the excitement behind the launch of this game.

Like its Warcraft and Witcher counterparts, Legends of Runeterra centers around your deck. Defeating your opponent requires you to whittle down their main health pool while defending your own. It's quite simple and isn't a best-two-out-of-three situation like Gwent. Each player gets an attack turn while the opposing person gets a chance to defend themselves as best they can. Each card has its own attack and health stat, and many have special abilities. There are also spell cards that have varying levels of speed (some are instant, others take a turn or two). These can be healing spells, barrier spells, and so on.

Cards break down into offense, defense, and support. The latter buff nearby allies with barriers, boosts to health/attack, etc. You have a mana system that determines what cards you can play. It builds up with each turn and some cards take several mana units to play.

Even if you're not into League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra is a nice break from Hearthstone while still feeling familiar. The tutorial introduces the game well, so give it like half an hour and you'll be good to go.


Legends of Runeterra
Dive into Riot Games' answer to Hearthstone, set in the League of Legends universe. Outwit your opponent to claim victory.

Majesty

Half sim, half real-time strategy, Majesty is one of my favorite time-waster games. You're in charge of a small kingdom and it's up to you to keep it safe, explore for resources, manage an economy, and deal with all of the other weirdness. Majesty is an eclectic game, to be sure, but it's also quite fun.

Of course, you can't talk about Majesty and forget about The Nothern Expansion. It's a bit extra, but it adds a new location and new problems to contend with, including dragons. You have more heroes, more resources, and changeable weather, too. For an extra $3, it's a nice expansion, especially if you like Majesty.

They're no Starcraft, but Majesty and The Northern Expansion are both great for killing time on the metro/bus, while you wait at the doctor's office, or what have you. Enjoy its fun gameplay and watch the hours fly by.


Majesty
Take up the mantle of a small kingdom's ruler as you try to make the best decision for your people. Battle monsters, explore, and build.


Majesty: The Northern Expansion
Adding more Majesty to your life is worth the $3, in my opinion, and The Northern Expansion certainly delivers. It adds a new area, new enemies, and new challenges.

Mindustry

Tower defense games are a dime a dozen in the Play Store, but few offer the depth and strategy that is on display with Mindustry. It's a sandbox-style game that is straight-up intimidating when you first start out since it gives you all the tools you need for success but makes it entirely up to you to use them in the most efficient and strategic way.

Not only do you need to concern yourself with mining resources to build up your defenses, but you also need to maintain and protect your supply lines — conveyor belts that deliver your mined resources from the drill to your core base and defense turrets. It took me the entire tutorial to get a handle on the build controls and core game mechanics, and another hour of playing the game before I started unlocking new technologies on the tech tree. It wasn't long until I started developing some rudimentary strategies that worked for a while, but soon the AI enemies figured my tactics, managed to bypass my defenses, and absolutely wrecked my base.

The solo mode only scratches the surface of everything that Mindustry has to offer. You can set up a multiplayer game with custom servers or over local area network, create your own map with the included map editor, or create a custom game with the player given full control over pretty much every aspect of the game. Best of all, you get this in a free-to-play game with no ads.


Mindustry
Mindustry is an incredible open-ended sandbox tower defense game that will blow you away with the level of depth and customization available to the player. Better still, it's free-to-play with no ads or in-app purchases.

Mini Metro

Living in the Washington, D.C. area, I'm quite familiar with the metro system here — it's frankly one of the best ways to get in and out of the city in my experience (especially since you can avoid the parking nightmare). So when I discovered Mini Metro in the Play Store, I grabbed it and had a lot of fun with it.

The basic premise is to design a metro system for a growing city by creating lines and stations. The goal is to keep going as long as you can with your limited resources. It's quite fun and each playthrough is a new approach. You have to strategize on how you want your system to function. Can you improve a line you already created and make it more efficient?

This is another one of those time-waster strategy games that is quite fun, funnily enough, while riding the metro. It's only a buck, too.


Mini Metro
You're the metro engineer and it's your job to design a system for your growing city. Use your limited resources wisely and try to make things as efficient as they can be.

Reigns: Her Majesty

Reigns was one of the best games of 2016 and actually won the first ever Google Play Indie Games contest. So needless to say we were pumped to check out the sequel.

In Reigns, you play as the monarch of the land and make decisions that affect four aspects of the kingdom: the church, the people, the army, and the royal wealth. Your goal is to keep all four in balance — if any meter fills to the max or is entirely depleted your reign is over… and a new reign begins!

The sequel plays nearly identically to the first game, except this time you play as the Queen instead of the King, complete with new characters to interact with and multiple branching storylines to discover. The gameplay is as easy as swiping left or right on cards and if it's anything like the first game there's a ton of great easter eggs to find along the way!

I would hate to spoil anything for this new game, but if you played the first one and are afraid that it's going to be too similar, I can assure you there are plenty of new mechanics to make this still one of the best games on Google Play.


Reigns: Her Majesty
Step into the role of regal leader of your own and parlay with your advisors and send out royal decrees just by swiping left or right. Just be sure not to let things get out of hand or it's your head on the chopping block.

XCOM: Enemy Within

XCOM achieved legendary status with its in-depth gameplay, challenge, and interesting style. That same spirit arrived on Android some time back with Enemy Within, the sequel to Enemy Unknonw, which adds on the iconic forumla. There are new soldiers, maps, enemies, abilities, and more for you to try out.

Once again, you're defending earth from aliens and victory is not guaranteed. You have to build the right squad for the circumstances as you head into the turn-based combat. New threats will challenge your tactics and your skills, pushing you to work hard for success.


XCOM: Enemy Within
Take on the classic XCOM gameplay with new soldiers, abilities, maps, and enemies. Fans of the franchise should find a lot to like here, especially since the port is fairly well done.
