Kotaku Australia’s Best Games Of 2020

It’s safe to say 2020 hasn’t been a normal year. From raging bushfires to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, there’s been plenty of challenges to overcome. These changes have been met head on by the video games industry, which has continued to thrive in 2020. In a year with so much hardship game releases have continued, giving everyone a much needed break from reality.

Final Fantasy VII Remake made waves when it launched in March and Animal Crossing: New Horizons follow suit a few weeks later, bringing everyone the joy they were missing at the start of the year. We also had the incredible Ori and the Will of the Wisps in March, the gorgeous Ghost of Tsushima in July and the impressive rise of Fall Guys in August.

With so many incredible games already released this year, it’s difficult to narrow down our favourites — but read on to see which games made the final cut.

Kotaku Australia’s 2020 GOTY List
Yakuza: Like A Dragon

If you’ve ever wanted to play a game “just for fun”, then the Yakuza series is exactly what you want. Filled to the brim with ridiculous moments, Like A Dragon ups the ante with some surprisingly effective turn-based combat and a new protagonist that truly fits the franchise.

Plus, what other next-gen game will let you summon a hen that shoots out an egg at light speed just to heal your party? Only Yakuza will.

Demon’s Souls

An absolute triumph, and a crowning achievement for the continued excellence of Sony’s in-house masters of remasters, Bluepoint Games.

[The] Demon’s Souls remake stands out as an incredibly fun way to revisit the cursed land of Boletaria. It’s creepy. It’s gloomy. You’ll get invaded by laggy arseholes near the end of a long level and have to do the whole thing over again. It feels like coming home.

Spider-Man: Miles Morales

An excellent continuation of the Spider-Man saga, with an arguably more empathetic and engaging character. Miles’ journey to save Harlem and his city is an excellent opening for the PS5, and a great technical benchmark for future titles.

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2
Lead
It’s a damaged Polaroid photo scanned, digitised, and lovingly retouched. It’s gravel picked out of a scraped knee. It’s a good night’s rest, untouched by nightmares and insomnia. It is, as it always was, exactly what I need right now.

Among Us

Among Us first launched in 2018, but its discovery by international streamers helped launch the deceptive party game into one of 2020’s most enormous hits. “That helped us get popularity there, and then sometime in the middle of 2019, [a YouTuber] in Brazil played it, and their fanbase picked it up, and it’s just been kind of slowing growing from there,” one of the developers told Kotaku.

You can download Among Us for free on Android or iOS through your phone's app stores, or buy the game on PC through Steam. 

 

Hades

Rather, developer Supergiant’s Greek mythology-flavored action roguelike is, improbably, the game that best characterises the year 2020.
Supergiant know how to make video games, and it's not a stretch to say that Hades might be the pinnacle of the studio's already excellent track record. "It’s an excellent roguelite, with an amazing story and addictive gameplay. But there’s another big reason why Hades is seeing such a massively positive response: Everyone is so friggin’ hot," Ash wrote.

You can buy Hades through the Epic Games Store or Steam,where it has a 98 per cent user rating from almost 45,000 reviews. Not bad, Supergiant.

Paper Mario: The Origami King

What do Red Koopa Troopas think about as they’re shuffling back and forth all day on top of platforms? Where do Shy Guys go on their days off? Paper Mario is the only series brave enough to answer these burning questions about the inner lives of Mario characters, and it answers them with humour, style, and more truly human moments than you can find in most of Nintendo’s fantasy worlds.
Seriously, you won't find an RPG like Paper Mario anywhere else. You can buy the digital version through the eShop or the (cheaper) physical copy here.

Star Wars: Squadrons

As a Star Wars experience though it’s incredible, and that’s what’s more important here. I’ve had people over to my house just to sit down and play the game, which is something I can’t remember happening since I got a Switch at launch.
I'm still waiting for some crucial patches to fix up parts of the PC experience, but even if you skip the multiplayer and just enjoy the campaign alone, Star Wars Squadrons is one hell of a game. And, if we're being honest, the kind of Star Wars game everyone has been screaming at EA to make since they got the license.

You can buy Star Wars Squadrons HERE for consoles, and here on Steam.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Animal Crossing: New Horizons presents an ideal world, where chores are as fun as fishing and crafting. A world where your friends are just moments away, and everything in life is pure and wholesome. In contrast, our own world is rather frightening right now. Animal Crossing is the perfect escape for these strange times.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake

It’s a lot of the little things brought to life in slightly different ways. The moment you discover Aerith’s house for the first time and the world lighting kicks in a second late, revealing a wonderful forest shrine encapsulated by flowers, herbs, hills and scrap surrounded by a waterfall. The sound kicks in with the sound of Aerith’s words, and the whole scene has so much more heart than Square could have envisioned back in the ‘90s.

Fall Guys
fall guys best games 2020
Whether you win or lose, Fall Guys is simple, honest fun. Every bean is just adorable and the courses are all extremely colourful. It’s whimsical, bright and totally charming. There’s a sense of effortless fun here, making it easy to fall in love with the game. There’s also a heap of variety, meaning even after hours of playing the game it’s unlikely you’ll end up on the same course too often.

Crusader Kings 3

Crusader Kings III may begin in what we used to call the Dark Ages, but it’s a Renaissance for strategy gaming in 2020.
Paradox games are always incredible in scope -- but for maybe the first time, they've also backed up with some serious UI improvements. A huge recommended game to anyone who enjoys visual novels, Bioware games, system simulators, you name it -- you'll find something in Crusader Kings 3 to your taste.

Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time
crash bandicoot 4 n gin boss guide
[Crash Bandicoot 4] is the original Crash Bandicoot trilogy on acid. Where before there were linear pathways, easily understood challenges and boxes hiding just in the corner of your vision there’s now big open worlds, multiple pathways, boxes hiding in places you’d never look and extremely well-hidden paths you can run past multiple times without spotting.

Golf With Your Friends
best games 2020 golf with your friends
Blacklight Interactive’s Golf With Your Friends proved to be a very popular title back in May, reaching Steam's top steam releases when it launched. There's a good reason — Golf With Your Friends is wacky good fun, and great to play with friends. There's a range of wild courses to choose from and each one has its own unique secrets to discover. Whether you're good at the game or not doesn't matter. It's so fun you'll have a good time anyway.

It's always nice to see Aussie games succeed and Golf With Yout Friends certainly deserves its place among the best games of 2020.

Microsoft Flight Simulator

Flight simulators have been around for decades — Microsoft Flight Simulator itself goes back to the late ’80s — but they have always existed as niche, independent products lacking the support, scale or budget that a major platform holder could provide. What Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 has in spades is that support and scalability. It is that rare breed of live service game that makes perfect sense.

Command & Conquer Remastered Collection

Command & Conquer: The Remastered Collection has that all-too rare quality. Precisely everything EA and Petroglyph promised they’d do, the remaster delivers. It’s the original Command & Conquer, along with Red Alert and all the expansions for both games. You can play in the original blocky sprites, or switch to crisp high-def with a tap of the space bar.

Desperadoes 3

Turning Desperados 3 into an origin story is a genius move, because the last Desperados game is almost 15 years old. But if you’ve played any stealth tactics games, Desperados 3 will sink in immediately.

Valorant

For now, as an ancient CS player and the kind of target audience for a game like this, I’m having a blast. So is much of my friends list, and some older folks I haven’t played with in decades have even popped up again out of the woodwork. That’s always a good sign. Everyone, to some degree or another, is having fun. And for a video game, that’s all you can ask.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps
2020 video games
It’s rare that a game makes me stop and go, ‘ooh,’ but the opening moments of Ori and the Will of the Wisps did just that. It’s genuinely beautiful, and there’ve been so many moments that have left me in awe.

The Last of Us Part 2

It’s easy to hold up The Last of Us 2 as a showcase of blockbuster gaming. It is, on the surface, a shining example of what can be achieved with enormous talent, budget and an exceedingly unhealthy amount of time. It is full of beautiful moments, astonishing scenery and the kind of luxury that few games are capable of.

Ghost of Tsushima

Ghost of Tsushima is a stunning game that represents the pinnacle of the modern console generation. In an era where original properties are becoming rarer, it tells a breathtaking story worthy of of being called one of PlayStation’s best. Accompanied by fantastic combat, a gorgeous open world and great gameplay mechanics, Ghost of Tsushima is an extraordinary adventure that everyone should experience for themselves.

The 12 Best Games For The Nintendo Switch
Image: Kotaku
You just bought a Nintendo Switch, or maybe a Switch Lite. Now it’s time to figure out what games you want to play. We’ve got you covered.

This article was originally published December 2019 and has been updated since its original publication.

Since the Switch came out, Nintendo has managed to maintain a solid ratio of good games on the system. There’s always been a healthy selection of fantastic Switch games to play, and it just keeps getting better and better.

As with all of our Bests lists, we’ll continue updating this one as long as people keep putting out new Switch games. Each game we add will need to replace an existing entry. This list in particular got really good relatively quickly, so expect it to become even better as more and more games come out.

Here are the 12 best games you can get for the Nintendo Switch.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a monumental artistic achievement, a video game so creative and full of surprises that we’ll be talking about it for years to come. It’s also unlike any Zelda game before it. Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game to date, and it accomplishes that simply by saying yes.

A Good Match For: Anyone who likes games that let you explore and make your own fun; horse lovers.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone who preferred the strict structure of other recent Zelda games.

Stardew Valley is an already-great game made indispensable by the Switch. The 2016 farming/dating/life sim lets you forget your worries and embrace a soothingly banal life in the countryside. You water your crops in the morning, and think about how you’re going to improve your farm. You head in to town and stop by the general store to get seeds and chat up the cute boy you’ve had your eye on. And if you want, you explore the mysterious mine, gather magical materials, and uncover the deeper secrets of the valley. It’s a game with a seemingly endless amount to do, and it fits perfectly onto a handheld.

A Good Match For: Fans of games like Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, or Minecraft. Anyone looking for a relaxing but terrifyingly addictive game.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone looking for a straightforward game. Stardew Valley is calming and low-key, but it’s also extremely complex and doesn’t alway explain itself that well.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate perfects the long-beloved Super Smash Bros. formula for both the button-mashing seven-year-old and the single-minded competitive gamer. It’s the old platform fighter we’ve been obsessed with since 1999, but this time, with a leviathan roster of 76 fighters. Mastering one could eat up a year, but it’s more fun to sample them all. Smash Ultimate is a museum of Nintendo celebrities, a gaming fandom WrestleMania. Everything is customisable: the rulesets, fighter balancing, stage hazards. With all that stuff, and so many ways to manipulate it, Smash Ultimate is a crowd-pleaser that doesn’t discriminate between a middle school birthday party and a stadium of screaming pros.

A Good Match For: Anyone with a competitive bone in their body, people who have at any point loved Nintendo, anyone who hosts parties or fans of any of the previous Smash games.

Not A Good Match For: People who hate conflict or primarily enjoy gaming alone.

Hollow Knight is a tiny epic that jams an extraordinary amount of secrets, challenges, and rewards into its sprawling subterranean kingdom. It’s a little bit Castlevania and a little bit Metroid, with a roomy map and remote regions you can only access after unlocking one of many character upgrades. It’s a little bit Dark Souls, with its forsaken kingdom, tough bosses, shortcut-strewn maps, and threat of losing progress upon death. And it shares platforming DNA with games like Ori and the Blind Forest and Super Meat Boy, all wall-slides and air-dashes. It bakes up those ingredients before frosting on a layer of its own distinct vibe, and those who choose to brave the buried insect realm of Hallownest will be rewarded with one of gaming’s great spelunking expeditions. Surprising, challenging, rewarding, and unexpectedly funny, Hollow Knight is absolutely worth your time, and works particularly well on the Switch.

A Good Match For: Those who like a challenge, Metroidvania fans, anyone looking for a deep, rewarding game to really sink their teeth into.

Not A Good Match For: The easily frustrated. Hollow Knight can be a brutal, unforgiving game, and it throws players into the deep end early. It contains bosses and platforming challenges that may have you tearing your hair out.

Ah, the blue shell. There may be no better metaphor for the bleakness of life. One minute you’re cruising along, on top of the world, and then bam, you’re totally hosed. Just when you thought you had it in the bag, life throws a blue shell.

Mario Kart 8 isn’t really all that philosophical, of course. It’s the same Mario Kart formula re-tuned and polished to an absurd degree, easily one of the most fun party games you can play on the Switch or any other console. Best of all, the Deluxe version on Switch includes all the DLC maps and characters from the Wii U game and also completely overhauls that version’s woebegone battle mode. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the definitive version of an already great game.

A Good Match For: People who like moving really fast, people who like seeing Luigi look really mean.

Not a Good Match For: People who don’t like Mario Kart? Do those people exist?

In the far-flung future, the only thing standing between the world and pan-dimensional invasion is an elite squad of sexy anime cops and their leashed demon companions. There’s also a woman in a dog costume. It’s a tale as old as time, really. Platinum Games has a reputation for creating sharp, stylish, over-the-top action games, a rep that once earned its Bayonetta 2 a regular spot on this list. Astral Chain combines that same frantic, satisfying action with outstanding world-building, creating a deep post-apocalyptic adventure unlike anything else on Switch.

A Good Match For: Anime lovers, action game fans who like having their performance scored, people who enjoy exploration and hunting for hidden things.

Not A Good Match For: People averse to sexy anime demon police.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a tactical RPG by way of Dawson’s Creek, as much a challenging game of chess as a matchmaking service for a camp of teenaged anime screw-ups. As much as Three Houses plays close to Fire Emblem traditions and plays tropes of Japanese role playing games straight, it also takes necessary departures in its plot and mechanics. By the end of the game you’ll want to play it again immediately”not just to replay the puzzles, but to see the narrative and characters from a new perspective.

A Good Match For: Anyone who loves romance and brain-tingling logic puzzles.

Not A Good Match For: Anyone who hates anime, heartbreak, and playing a game three times.

Undertale might look like a retro-style JRPG, but it’s unusually forward-thinking. As a human stuck in a world of monsters, you decide whether you want to win encounters with wanton violence or clever context-based interactions (talking, joking, petting, etc). Undertale keeps track of everything you do; it’s paying very close attention, and will often express that attention in surprising ways. Every life you take ultimately has consequences. Despite those grim trappings, Undertale can be an incredibly warm, fuzzy, and funny game. Whether you slaughter or befriend everyone (or walk a middle path), the writing in this game is top-tier, the soundtrack is second-to-none, and the plot hides a treasure trove of secrets that players still haven’t fully uncovered.

A Good Match For: Lovers of smart video game stories, fans of games that subvert expectations, people who’ve ever felt even a single pang of loneliness.

Not A Good Match For: People who hate shoot-’em-ups and tough boss battles (Undertale‘s combat system has elements of both), those who aren’t fond of reading dialogue, haters of lo-fi pixel art.

You’ve never played anything like Baba Is You. You might never play anything like it again. It’s a simple block-pushing puzzle game, except the blocks you’re pushing are actually the rules of the game themselves. The puzzles quickly scale up in difficulty, and you have to wrap your brain around the concept that everything, including you, can be redefined on the fly. A triumphant puzzle masterpiece.

A Good Match For: People who, in the words of Mike Selinker and Thomas Snyder, solve puzzles because they like pain, and they like being released from pain, and they like most of all that they find within themselves the power to release themselves from their own pain.

Not A Good Match For: People who immediately run to GameFAQs every time Nathan Drake has to align three spinning wheels or whatever.

Celeste is a difficult game, but it’s just so gentle about it. As you help your character mantle and warp-jump her way to the top of the eponymous mountain, you’ll find that no matter how complex a room looks, the underlying solution is simple: jump. That purity of design combines with fine-tuned controls and a charming story to make Celeste into a winning, joyful experience. The music is fantastic, too.

There weren’t that many reasons to buy a Wii U, but Super Mario Maker was definitely one of the biggest ones. Whether you wanted to make your own Mario levels or just play an infinite number of fan-created ones, it was a delight. The Switch sequel is packed with quality-of-life upgrades for makers and players both, like the ability to make Super Mario 3D World-themed levels with unique gameplay. It also brought online multiplayer to Mario, and it’s a rollicking good time. From nearly-impossible kaizo levels to creative fun-for-all levels that twist around old Mario tropes, Super Mario Maker is only as limited as the imaginations of a few million people.

A Good Match For: Armchair game designers who want to try to out-Miyamoto Miyamoto, and Mario players who crave the most exquisite of challenges.

Not A Good Match For: Those who are looking for a lengthy, grand Mario experience on the order of Odyssey.

Super Mario Odyssey is all about freedom, and it is glorious. Unlike recent Mario games, the red-hatted plumber no longer must move forward in a straight line. The timer is gone, and each level is a toybox filled with platforming challenges, surprising secrets, and all kinds of goofy fun. It’s one of the best feeling, most charming, freshest games we’ve played in ages, and a cinch to recommend on the Switch.

A Good Match For: Platforming fans, Mario 64 and Sunshine fans, people who like hats.

Not A Good Match For: People who hate 3D platforming, people who hate hats.
