5.0
$3.99 at Apple.com
SEE IT

Blizzard may not make a ton of games, but the games it does make always have an impact. Starcraft turned real-time strategy into a televised sport. World of Warcraft created a massively multiplayer online world that's arguably better than the real world. Then, the Warcraft spin-off Hearthstone demonstrated that a virtual trading-card game can be arguably better than real-world card games. Even if you've never built a deck or played a single session of WoW, Hearthstone will draw you in with its complex but approachable card battling system and not-horrible use of in-app purchases.
