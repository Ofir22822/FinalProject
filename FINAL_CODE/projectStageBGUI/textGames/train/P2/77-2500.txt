19 Nintendo Switch Games for Every Kind of Player
From Hyrule to Hallownest, these are our absolute favorite videogame escapes for the Switch and Switch Lite.
THE SWITCH IS one of Nintendo's most successful and influential systems ever. There’s something unique about carrying a home-console-quality gaming device everywhere you go. Figuring out what to play, though—that's getting harder every year, as the roster of first-party and indie games grows deeper and deeper.

Thankfully, WIRED has plenty of opinionated Nintendo fans on staff, and we've put our heads together to compile a list of the best Switch games. We've listed the digital version for most of them here, so make sure you get a spacious MicroSD card to store all your game files. (We recommend this one.) Be sure to also read up on our Switch Tips and Secrets, Favorite Switch Accessories, and Bundle Deals.

Updated for June 2020: We added Jackbox to our roundup.

Super Mario Odyssey
If it weren't for Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey might have taken home even more game-of-the-year awards in 2017. The game plays like a 3D Mario game, à la Mario 64, but instead of collecting stars, you're hunting for nearly 1,000 moons that propel your airship. The worlds are quirky and densely packed with new gameplay, like Mario's new living hat that lets him inhabit classic Super Mario creatures like Goombas and Chomp Chains. We called it "a surrealist triumph" in our review. [For 1-2 players]

Nintendo Animal Crossing: New Horizons
The newest Animal Crossing installment plops you on a deserted island. Through the help of DIY recipes, crafting materials, your neighbors, and your favorite capitalist raccoon, you can transform the island into a bustling paradise. Robust social features let you live your island dreams alongside your real-life friends (though local co-op is a little lacking). AC:NH will be familiar to Animal Crossing fans, but there are enough new aspects to keep you intrigued if you've played other games in the series. This title is especially great if you could use a mental break. [For 1-8 players]

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Breath of the Wild is a stunning reimagining of The Legend of Zelda series. The linear story of previous Zelda games is gone entirely, replaced by a wide-open world with dungeons and hidden secrets you can tackle as you wish. Breath of the Wild is sometimes more difficult and holds your hand less, but it's so amazingly fun to explore Hyrule, and you'll enjoy making mistakes. Did we mention Link can climb any mountain you see in this picture? Read our full review. [For 1 player]

Fortnite
Fortnite on the Switch is a marriage of a great platform with a stellar game. The stirring, driven competition of 100 players set against one another scales down to the portable framework of the Switch shockingly well, making for snappy, thrilling play sessions. And Fortnite is a much better game than its critics make it out to be, with a winning aesthetic, sharp gunplay, and dense but satisfying building mechanics. Best yet, it's always changing, cycling through more ideas in a play season than some games do in their lifetime. Read our full review. [For 100 players online]

Nintendo Labo Cardboard Kits
There's no game like Labo on any platform. It comes in a kit with more than 20 sheets of cardboard. You'll spend hours folding and building the five Labo widgets in the Variety Kit, following fun, onscreen instructions. There's an RC car, fishing pole, piano, house, and motorcycle handlebars. Once you're done, you snap the Switch screen and Joy-Con controllers into their spots in each Labo Toy-Con and play games with them. The Vehicle Kit is our favorite. Read our full review.

Dead Cells
In Dead Cells, you are a little ball of goo who inhabits a new dead body every time you die. And you’ll die a lot. (That’s part of the fun. No, really!) Dead Cells is a roguelike game along the lines of a Castlevania, but it is more than the sum of its predecessors. With rich progression and a clever blend of randomized and static world elements, Dead Cells offers a uniquely approachable (and addictive) spin on a classic genre. [For 1 player]

Cuphead
Drawing inspiration from classic Disney animation, Cuphead is a gorgeous and hellishly difficult platformer from Studio MDHR. Why does it look so good, you ask? Well, it’s hand-drawn. Every frame of this quirky and offbeat platformer was drawn by hand and animated with traditional cel animation, and all that painstaking work shows. This is a tough game, but the rich details make it like nothing else you’ve ever played. [For 1-2 players]

Overcooked 2 (Switch)
Some co-op games provide an environment to inspire moments of beautiful collaboration between you and your closest friends. Then there’s Overcooked 2. This cooperative cooking sim inspires a different kind of emotion, usually something between rage and frustration and oh-my-god-will-someone-please-wash-the-dishes! At its core though, it’s a game about facing unexpected challenges as a team and working together to defeat undead bread zombies—the unbread. [For 1-4 players]

In this multiplayer shooter, you’ll use a number of unique paint weapons (like paint sniper rifles and giant rollers) to color the map and take out enemies. The winning team is the one that paints the largest portion of the map. Even if you’re not usually into shooters, this is like nothing you’ve ever played before. [For 1-8 players]

Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
Toad has been Princess Peach's loyal sidekick for decades in the Super Mario universe, but Nintendo has finally given him (and his friend Toadette) a starring role. Captain Toad was one of the best Wii U games, and we're elated it's now available on the Switch. Instead of hopping around like Mario, Captain Toad places you into dozens of compact puzzle worlds where you must avoid danger and explore to find treasure. The Switch version has some added Mario Odyssey–inspired levels, too. [For 1 player]

Depending on the pack you get, players may find themselves designing awful T-shirt slogans, drawing Pictionary-style, competing in trivia contests, or sleuthing out fibbers from the group. Instead of using Joy-Cons or other controllers, players use their phones or tablets and a web browser. With some effort, you can even play with friends long-distance. [For 1-8 players]

Snipperclips is one of the most innovative cooperative games out there. You can play it alone, but it's way more fun with friends. Each person controls a paper character (Snip and Clip), and you must work together to cut each other into the right shapes to solve a wide variety of physics-based puzzles. It's the kind of game that will test your patience—and your relationships. The Plus version adds extra levels and four-player modes. [For 1-4 players]

Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle
Mixing Super Mario and Ubisoft's Rabbids sounds bizarre, but it's so off-the-wall weird that it somehow works. You play as a mix-and-match team of Mario and Rabbids characters solving some simple puzzles in an overworld, but mostly battling against teams of enemy Rabbids. The gameplay is turn-based and tactical. You move Mario and other characters around a grid filled with obstacles and chain their attacks together to strategically take out opponents. It's good, clean, goofy fun. Read our full review. [For 1-2 players]

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is another one of Nintendo's enhanced Wii U ports, and it still holds up. Its spectacular tracks, colorful karts, and the myriad of dirty tricks make it a marquee multiplayer experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console. A new smart steering option opens the game up to younger kids, too, giving them a way to play along without getting completely trounced. Whether drifting, hovering, or gliding around the scenic courses, you’re almost guaranteed to grin while playing it. [For 1-8 players]

Untitled Goose Game
Untitled Goose Game lets you explore a single day in the consequence-free life of a criminal goose, and it's fantastic. You're given a series of increasingly difficult tasks, almost all of which involve acts of petty (and not so petty) larceny and vandalism, which you need to complete without being thwarted by the townsfolk of an idyllic English country village. It's a self-described slapstick-stealth-sandbox game, with a surprising degree of replay value. Seriously, once you finish your initial to-do list (yes this goose has a to-do list), the game restarts with an even more difficult version of that list, challenging you to be the very best goose you can be.

Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition
Kentucky Route Zero is an adventure game that weaves several individual tales into a rich tapestry as beautiful as it is haunting. Originally released in 2013 as a series of episodes and interludes that were sold individually, the Switch version compiles the entire catalog of Kentucky Route Zero stories into a single volume. It's a game Switch owners have been clamoring for, and now that it's finally here it doesn't disappoint. Even though it's a couple of years old, the stories, art, and music feel as fresh and vital as ever. If you're a fan of a slow-burn kind of story, this is one you shouldn't miss. [For 1 player]

Pokemon Sword & Shield is the first original Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch, and it's both a departure and a return to form for Game Freak. It's the first mainline Pokémon game on a home console, which is exciting new territory, but it's also a return to the classic Pokémon formula longtime fans will be familiar with. It's approachable for beginners and deep enough for seasoned trainers to enjoy spending hours in the forests and meadows of the Galar region trying to catch them all. [For 1 player]

The Best Xbox One Games
Relive classics, play co-op with friends, and enjoy the mayhem of a battle royale with our favorite Xbox titles.
THE XBOX ONE may not have the momentum of the Switch or the buzz surrounding the upcoming PlayStation 5, but that's just fine. It's been around the block a few times and has a massive catalog of amazing titles to play.

Between the powerful Xbox One X and its surprisingly robust Game Pass subscription that gives you access to 100-plus games (including a good number of titles on this list), Microsoft has managed to carve out its own path in the past half-decade. And it has bigger plans for the near future. But to get the most out of your home console now, here are some of the best Xbox One games we've played. There are plenty of fantastic titles not listed here, but these are the ones that stuck with us.

Be sure to also check out our guides to our favorite Online Co-op Games, Best PS4 Games, and Best Switch Games too.

Explosive Action
Sunset Overdrive
Wild, fast, and kind of stupid, Sunset Overdrive is Insomniac Games' love letter to pop punk nonsense and shallow teen rebellion. Which, OK, doesn't sound that great as a subject matter for a video game, but believe me: Sunset Overdrive rules. Its movement system and creative combat options, combined with its bright color palette, anoint it as an unlikely child of Jet Set Radio, while its engine and creative energy became the bedrock for Insomniac's later take on acrobatic open-world action in Spider-Man.

If you like open worlds, goofy aesthetics, and acrobatic movement, Sunset Overdrive is the cult classic you've been waiting for. It's included with Xbox Game Pass.

The Outer Worlds
If you’ve ever asked yourself “What if Fallout: New Vegas had spaceships?” then Outer Worlds is your game. It’s a sci-fi RPG set in colorful and creative open world(s), with memorable characters, tough choices, and adorable alien lizard-fish.

You play the role of a colonist left adrift by one of many greedy corporations that rule the outer reaches of space. You can band together with dissidents seeking a life outside corporate chains, stick with the companies seeking to tame and colonize the wilds of space, or forge your own path. It's included with Xbox Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate.

This game is as charming as it is gruesome. You take on the role of a gleeful, always-dancing Grim Reaper named Felix. Your job is to arrange circumstances to end the lives of poor mortals, and this plays out against a background of funky beats and thoughtful puzzles. While you dance around the environment, positioning everything just so, you have to avoid the sun and stay in the shadows.

Also, Patrick Stewart is in it? It’s hard to describe, but well worth buying—or you can get it with Xbox Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate.

Inside
After 2006's macabre platformer Limbo proved to be one of the most enjoyable indie titles available for the Xbox 360, people wondered—OK, we wondered—if Danish studio Playdead could meet its own bar for the current generation. We needn't have worried. Inside begins with the same gloomy monochrome that made Limbo so affecting, and adds a healthy dose of danger; it's not just the treacherous environment you have to worry about as you navigate the world, but people and things that are actively looking to kill you.

You will die, and you will die often. But when the game enters its final act, you'll be treated with that rarest of gaming moments: A sincere "what the f*ck?" spectacle; a jaw-dropping hybrid of body horror and slapstick that you'll feel, fittingly enough, inside.

A Way Out
If you've ever wondered what a Shawshank Redemption game might feel like, this is it. You must execute a meticulous plan to escape from prison, and you do it entirely with a partner. Just one of you needs to buy the game, and it's playable over Xbox Live or locally via split-screen. The focus on cooperative play leads to some tense and exciting scenarios, including (but not limited to) climbing a shaft together and hiding in a laundry hamper.

It's not a flawless game, but couch co-op is all too rare these days, and the camaraderie you'll build with a friend is worth the admission.

And if you think getting into fights with a bunch of cartoon pastiches will be easy, you are sorely mistaken. Cuphead will be a struggle, certainly, but it'll be a charming one.

War Trauma
Gears 5
The latest entry in the Gears series is, according to critics, one of the best. An adult take on war trauma, Gears 5 brings gravitas and refreshing perspective to the long-running third-person-shooter series.

Gears 5 is set against the backdrop of a never-ending war we've seen play out in the earlier four entries and follows in the footsteps of last year's God of War by taking a well-worn franchise and turning a critical eye toward the development of its own characters and world. On top of that, the third-person action gameplay is just as polished and satisfying as ever. It's included with Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

Puzzle Escape
The Witness
Puzzle games can't win. Either they're not as clever as they think they are, or they are as clever as they think they are, which is often somehow worse. Either they shoehorn otherwise compelling brainteasers into a threadbare story, or they're so bent on drawing you into their world that the puzzles suffer. These maddening intersections are exactly where The Witness stands.

The brainchild of Jonathan Blow, who managed to thread most of the genre's needles with 2008's Braid, it places you on an abandoned island, where you slowly, sloooooowly begin to make sense of things by solving a series of ever-escalating puzzles. (And even the early ones aren't easy.) It's at once entrancing and infuriating, in the best way possible. We think.

Fortnite has taken a lot of the mainstream attention, but PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds popularized the idea of a 100-player, last person standing battle royale first. It's less zany than Fortnite, but more serious players (or players who dislike building) may like it more. It's intense and a ton of fun. Updates since the game's launch have added snowy environments and a snowmobile to traverse them. It comes with Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

It may have an animated aesthetic with backdrops that look like a more serious version of recent Rayman games, but Ori and the Blind Forest is no easy walk-to-the-right sidescroller. It is a deep platforming action-adventure—kind of in the vein of Metroid or Castlevania games—and brutally difficult at times. Your goal is to return light to the forest and you slowly become a very capable little fighter as you progress. Read more about it here.

Sea of Thieves
I wish I could tell you that Sea of Thieves is flawless in every way. It's not. The core story and missions are not fleshed out, and the world can feel lifeless at times.

That's if you play alone. If you have 2-3 friends ready to sail the seas with you, the open-ended nature of the game can become a strength. Manning a tiny sloop ship or massive galleon takes a lot of teamwork and fighting off other players (or skeleton crews) while taking on the wind and sea is truly exhilarating. It's free if you have Xbox Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

Firewatch is sad, slow, and beautiful. As much a game as a short story you'll find in The New Yorker, it's the tale of a man in the wilderness trying to find a way to live with his past. As wildfires build on the horizon, you'll explore the Wyoming wilderness with care and earnestness that's rare to find in games.

Campo Santo created, in Firewatch, one of the most subtle, adult, and moving stories ever told in a videogame. It plays with the storytelling conventions of games, almost crafting a traditional narrative before revealing something quieter and more intimate.

Some games like to fashion themselves as sorts of vacations, taking the players to exotic locations and let them experience things they couldn't otherwise. The idea of driving cars around England isn't, maybe, the most ambitious vacation idea anyone has ever had. But Forza Horizon 4 makes it seem like one of the best. Like many games on this list, it comes included with Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
