VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME
 START AT #100
GET STARTED!
AS WE SAID WHEN WE PUSHED OUT 2018’S LIST, COMING UP WITH THE TOP 100 VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME IS A DAUNTING TASK. BUT THIS YEAR WE REVISED SOME OF OUR CRITERIA, MAKING IT A (SOMEWHAT) LESS DAUNTING TASK — EVEN IF IT MEANT MAKING SOME PAINFUL CUTS IN THE PROCESS.

AS WE LEAVE THE DECADE BEHIND AND LOOK FORWARD TO A NEW GENERATION OF CONSOLES, WE BELIEVE IT’S TIME TO TAKE STOCK OF THE GAMES THAT WE WOULD STILL RECOMMEND EVEN ONCE WE’VE GOT OUR PS5S AND OUR XBOX SCARLETTS; GAMES THAT ARE SO GOOD, THEY TRANSCEND DECADES. THE PRIMARY CRITERIA WE CONSIDERED WHEN CREATING THIS UPDATED LIST IS AS FOLLOWS:

HOW MUCH DID THIS GAME IMPACT US, AND CAN IT STILL BE CONSIDERED AN EXCELLENT GAME IN 2019?

THIS MEANT WE DE-EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF LONGER INFLUENCE ON THE INDUSTRY, EVEN IF MANY OF THE GAMES ON 2019’S LIST WERE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL (IF IT WERE ALL BASED ON INFLUENCE, 90% OF THE GAMES WOULD BE FROM BEFORE 2003). ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE GAMES ON THIS LIST MAY BE A LITTLE LONG IN THE TOOTH, WE STILL BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF THEM STANDS UP AS AN INCREDIBLE GAMING EXPERIENCE TO THIS DAY.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

WE DIDN’T WANT THIS LIST TO BE INUNDATED WITH ZELDAS AND MARIOS, SO WE CUT WHAT WE FELT WASN’T THE PEAK OF THOSE SERIES IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR DIFFERENT GAMES.
WE PLACED NO SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT EDITIONS OR VERSIONS OF A GAME, EVEN IF IT HAS APPEARED ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.
ALL ENTRIES MUST BE A SINGLE VIDEO GAME — BUNDLES OR COMPILATIONS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE (SORRY, SUPER MARIO ALL-STARS AND ORANGE BOX).
THIS LIST WAS FORMED FROM THE COLLECTIVE OPINIONS OF EVERYONE ON IGN’S CORE CONTENT TEAM.

POKÉMON GO
RELEASED
2016
100

JUSTIN VACHONPOKEMON GO IN 2019 IS A GAME I SHOULDN’T CARE ABOUT. WHEN IT LAUNCHED IN 2016 IT WAS IN A LOT OF WAYS A MEDIOCRE EXPERIENCE. OUTSIDE OF CATCHING THE ORIGINAL 151 POKEMON THE GAME ITSELF RELIED HEAVILY ON THE NOSTALGIA OF THE POKEMON FRANCHISE AND AUGMENTED REALITY GIMMICK OF HAVING THEM SHOW UP IN THE REAL WORLD. IF YOU DIDN’T CARE ABOUT THE IP, THE GAME ITSELF WAS VERY LACKING. IN 2019, THE GAME IS FLOODED WITH A MULTITUDE OF TASKS, ACTIVITIES, AND EVENTS THAT CAN INVOLVE ANYONE FROM YOURSELF TO A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE. THESE ADDITIONS CREATE AN EXPERIENCE THAT INCENTIVIZES USERS TO BE MORE DEDICATED TO DAILY PLAY WITHOUT FEELING LIKE A GRIND. FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AND ALLOWS USERS TO NOW EXCHANGE GIFTS, TRADE OR EVEN BATTLE EACH OTHER. QUESTS (RESEARCH TASKS AS THEY ARE REFERRED TO IN-GAME) HAVE BEEN ADDED THAT REWARD ITEMS AND EVEN SPECIAL POKEMON. EVENTS NOW FILL EACH MONTH’S CALENDAR WITH NEW (AND SOMETIMES SHINY) POKEMON, EXCLUSIVE REWARDS AND NEW WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME. THERE IS EVEN A BURGEONING COMPETITIVE PVP SCENE WHICH GAVE POKEMON GO ITS FIRST-EVER APPEARANCE AT THE POKEMON WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS YEAR.

THE LIST GOES ON OF ALL THE MECHANICS AND ELEMENTS THAT MAKE POKEMON GO A GAME THAT’S WORTH PLAYING EVERY DAY IN 2019. AS ANDREW GOLDFARB STATED LAST YEAR WHEN WE NAMED POKEMON GO OUR HUNDREDTH GAME, “IT IS AS RELEVANT FOR WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE GAME AS WHAT HAPPENS IN IT,” AND TO THIS DAY THAT COULD NOT BE MORE TRUE. FEW GAMES IN HISTORY HAVE DONE AS MUCH TO BRING TOGETHER COMMUNITIES OF THE MOST DISPARATE INTERESTS, LOCATIONS, CULTURES, ETC AS MUCH AS POKEMON GO HAS. THE EXPERIENCES I HAVE HAD, THE PLACES I HAVE GONE AND THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET BECAUSE OF POKEMON GO ARE ALL PART OF WHY IT IS STILL SO SPECIAL TO THIS DAY. WITH THE GAME HAVING ITS HIGHEST-GROSSING MONTH SINCE LAUNCH, IT'S SAFE TO SAY POKEMON GO ISN'T GOING...ANYWHERE, ESPECIALLY NOT OFF OF THIS LIST.

DID YOU KNOW?
THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIVE (OF EIGHT) GENERATIONS OF POKEMON IN THE GAME, WITH MORE BEING ADDED EACH YEAR.
TO CURB TRESPASSING, TEXAS A&M OPENED ITS FOOTBALL STADIUM TO PLAYERS AND ENDED UP ATTRACTING 1,600 PLAYERS IN TWO HOURS.
THE GAME HAS HELPED SEVERAL LOCAL BUSINESSES ATTRACT GROWTH JUST BY SETTING UP LURES AND WATCHING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS POUR IN.
BORDERLANDS 2
RELEASED
2012

SETH MACYBORDERLANDS 2 ELEVATED AN EXCELLENT GAME TO LEGENDARY STATUS. THE ORIGINAL BORDERLANDS CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF GAMERS, SEEMINGLY FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, AND ITS SEQUEL TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL GREAT AND EXPANDED ON IT. FROM ITS SEAMLESS CONTINUATION OF THE BORDERLANDS VAULT HUNTING LORE, TO ITS UNMATCHED WRITING, BORDERLANDS 2 REMAINS THE HIGH POINT IN THE BORDERLANDS FRANCHISE. BORDERLANDS 3 IS OVERFLOWING WITH IMPROVEMENTS OVER ITS PREDECESSOR THE PRE-SEQUEL, BUT BORDERLANDS 2 STILL CAN'T BE BEAT FOR ITS AWESOME LEVELS, EXCELLENT DLC, AND SERIES-BEST VILLAIN, HANDSOME JACK.

DID YOU KNOW?
DAMAGE COUNTERS IN THE BORDERLANDS SERIES WERE ORIGINALLY A DEBUG FEATURE FOR THE PROGRAMMERS AND PARTIALLY INSPIRED BY RPGS LIKE FINAL FANTASY. GAME TESTERS LIKED IT SO MUCH, IT BECAME A PART OF THE SERIES.
AN EASTER EGG IN THE CAUSTIC CAVERNS LEVEL UNLOCKS A MINECRAFT HEAD FOR PLAYERS WHO FIND ITS OFF-MAP LOCATION AND DEFEAT A GIANT CREEPER.
ALMOST EVERYONE ON THE CREATIVE TEAM FOR BORDERLANDS 2 HAS SINCE LEFT GEARBOX.
DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2
RELEASED
2017
98

CASEY DEFREITASWHEN I WAS FAMISHED FOR DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 FILLED THAT VOID FOR ME. IT GAVE ME THE FREEDOM TO CHEAT, STEAL, KILL, OR PERSUADE MY WAY WITH KINDNESS THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN WITH A FRIEND (OR THREE!) JUST LIKE IN D&D. CREATIVE PLAY IS NOT ONLY ALLOWED, BUT ENCOURAGED AND INTENTIONALLY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE DEVELOPERS. IT FELT LIBERATING PLAYING A HUGE RPG THAT REWARDS “CHEATING” THE SYSTEM, AND ENCOUNTERING NPCS AND OPPONENTS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE AND REACT TO IT. I’VE SINCE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL OF MY REAL-LIFE D&D PARTIES, AND THEY’VE ALL COME BACK WITH THE SAME OPINION: THIS IS THE BEST D&D EXPERIENCE YOU CAN GET FROM A VIDEO GAME. DOS2 EVEN HAS A GAME MASTER MODE, WHICH LETS YOU BUILD YOUR OWN CAMPAIGNS. BUT, THE BUILT-IN STORY IS DECIDEDLY PLENTY AND NEARLY INFINITELY REPLAYABLE. THE PREMADE CHARACTERS ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL STORYLINES, AND THE NUMEROUS WAY THINGS PAN OUT DEPEND ON PLAYER ACTIONS, BACKSTORY CHOICES, RACE, AND MORE. WHETHER PLAYING ON AN EASY OR HARD DIFFICULTY SETTING, AS AN ELF RANGER OR AN UNDEAD CONJURER, AS A HELPFUL ADVENTURER OR A MURDEROUS THIEF, DOS2 IS A FUN FANTASY WORLD TO GET LOST IN NO MATTER WHAT.

DID YOU KNOW?
THE "DEFINITIVE EDITION" DOESN'T JUST INCLUDE IMPROVED VISUALS - IT COMPLETELY REWORKS THE GAME'S THIRD ACT.
FUNDS FOR THE GAME WERE PROCURED THROUGH KICKSTARTER, THE CAMPAIGN FOR WHICH WAS FULLY FUNDED (AND THEN SOME) IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.
DEVELOPER LARIAN STUDIOS WON OVER WIZARDS OF THE COAST (AND THUS THE RIGHTS TO MAKE BALDUR'S GATE 3) WITH DIVINITY OS 2.
DISHONORED
RELEASED
2012
97

BRENDAN GRAEBERDISHONORED MANAGED TO BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO A FALTERING STEALTH GENRE BY INVIGORATING PLAYERS WITH A HOST OF MAGICAL ABILITIES AND WICKEDLY CLEVER TOOLS FOR EVERY OCCASION. BY ALLOWING YOU TO GET CREATIVE WITH STEALTH (OR A TOTAL LACK THEREOF), PLAYERS COULD SLIP THROUGH LEVELS LIKE A GHOSTLY WRAITH, OR SLICE UP UNSUSPECTING FOES AS A MURDEROUS SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. DISHONORED REVITALIZED THE STEALTH GENRE WITH ITS APPROACH TO REWARDING EACH PLAYSTYLE: WHETHER CHALLENGING YOURSELF TO REMAIN UNSEEN AND GETTING YOUR REVENGE WITHOUT EVER SPILLING BLOOD, OR SPRINGING DEADLY TRAPS AND DISPOSING OF TARGETS IN THE MOST GRUESOME WAY POSSIBLE. ITS LEVELS ARE IMPECCABLY DESIGNED TO REWARD CAREFUL EXPLORATION AND PLANNING, AND PROVIDE MULTIPLE WAYS TO COMPLETE OBJECTIVES WITH SECRETS CRAMMED IN EVERY CORNER.

DID YOU KNOW?
THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE IN DISHONORED, PROTAGONIST CORVO ATTANO WAS VOICED BY STEPHEN RUSSELL IN DISHONORED 2, WHO PLAYED ANOTHER ICONIC STEALTH PROTAGONIST: GARRETT FROM THE THIEF SERIES.
EACH OF THE MAIN TARGETS IN DISHONORED CAN BE ELIMINATED BY NONLETHAL MEANS - BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE SOMETIMES A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH.
ACCORDING TO THE OUTSIDER, ONLY EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES CORVO WERE GRANTED THE OUTSIDER'S MARK THAT ALLOWED FOR SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES.
FINAL FANTASY VII
RELEASED
1997
96

MATT PURSLOWFINAL FANTASY VII IS A LANDMARK JRPG FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT MANY OF ITS ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE NOW BEEN LOST TO THE WINDS OF TIME AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. YET, ITS AGE HAS DONE NOTHING TO CHANGE ITS STATUS AS THE SERIES' MOST POPULAR AND BELOVED ENTRY, WHICH HAS COME ABOUT THANKS TO ITS WIDE CAST OF DETAILED, EMOTIONALLY-DRIVEN CHARACTERS THAT JOURNEY THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE WORLDS TO EMERGE FROM JAPAN'S DEVELOPMENT SCENE. FUNDAMENTALLY A STORY ABOUT DEALING WITH LOSS AND GRIEF, FINAL FANTASY VII FEATURES TROUBLED HEROES FIGHTING AGAINST THE CORPORATE MIGHT OF THE SHINRA COMPANY, WHICH IS RAPIDLY CAUSING PLANETARY DEVASTATION IN THE NAME OF PROFIT. THE PACING OF THIS CONTINUALLY TIMELY TALE IS ITS MASTERSTROKE; SQUARE ALLOWS YOU TO SLOWLY FALL FOR ITS RAG-TAG BUNCH OF ECO-TERRORISTS BEFORE INTRODUCING ITS MAIN VILLAIN - THE FOREVER CHILLING SEPHIROTH - AND THEN FOCUSSING THE STORY ON MUCH MORE PERSONAL STAKES, DESPITE THE LOOMING APOCALYPSE. WHILE OVERALL THE STORY IS HEAVY AND SOMBRE, THE WORLD THRIVES ON ITS IDIOSYNCRASIES - A VARIETY OF BIZARRE INCIDENTAL ENEMIES, COMEDIC MINIGAMES, AND INCREASINGLY ABSURDLY SIZED SWORDS. IT'S THIS COMBINATION OF LIGHT AND DARK THAT MAKES FINAL FANTASY VII SUCH AN ENDURING JRPG CLASSIC.

DID YOU KNOW?
ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO LAUNCH ON THE SNES, THEN THE NINTENDO 64, BEFORE FINALLY LANDING ON THE ORIGINAL PLAYSTATION.FINAL FANTASY VII WAS ORIGINALLY SET TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THE SNES AS A TRADITIONAL 2D JRPG, FOLLOWING THE STORY OF A DETECTIVE INVESTIGATING THE DESTRUCTION OF MIDGAR.
RUBY AND EMERAL WEAPON - THE GAME'S TWO HARDEST OPTIONAL BOSSES - WERE NOT IN THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION OF FINAL FANTASY VII. THEY WERE ADDED FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN RELEASES.
AT THE TIME, FINAL FANTASY VII WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE VIDEO GAME EVER MADE, WITH A BUDGET OF AROUND $45 MILLION.
ASSASSIN'S CREED IV: BLACK FLAG
RELEASED
2013
95

JON RYANTHERE ARE PLENTY OF ENTRIES IN THE ASSASSINS CREED FRANCHISE THAT COULD FIND THEIR WAY ONTO A TOP 100 LIST, BUT FOR OUR MONEY DOUBLOONS, BLACK FLAG WAS AS MUCH FUN AS WE’VE HAD IN THE FRANCHISE. SURE, THERE HAVE BEEN GAMES THAT IMPROVED ON THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF THE AC SERIES, BUT AC4 IS AN EXCEPTIONAL BLEND OF BOTH THE MASSIVE OPEN-WORLD EXPLORATION THAT THE FRANCHISE REMAINS KNOWN FOR AND THE STEALTH-FOCUSED MISSION STRUCTURE THAT GAVE THE SERIES ITS ROOTS. ITS NAVAL COMBAT AND OCEANIC EXPLORATION OFFERED BOUNDLESS FUN ON THE HIGH SEAS, AND THERE STILL HASN'T BEEN A HISTORICAL GUEST STAR THAT RIVALED THE LIKES OF BLACKBEARD OR MARY READ.

DID YOU KNOW?
THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM PULLED MUCH OF THEIR INFORMATION FROM TWO BOOKS: 2007'S THE REPUBLIC OF PIRATES BY COLIN WOODWARD AND THE GENERAL HISTORY OF PYRATES, ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 1724
THE SUBTITLES FOR BLACK FLAG ADOPT A STYLE WHERE EVERY PROPER NOUN IS CAPITALIZED (AS IN "EVERY NOUN IN EACH SENTENCE IN THE BOOK"), WHICH IS THE STYLE IN WHICH THE GENERAL HISTORY OF PYRATES WAS WRITTEN.
BLACK FLAG'S MODERN-DAY SEGMENTS CONTAIN REFERENCES TO THE BLUME COMPANY, THE CORPORATE ANTAGONISTS IN THE WATCH DOGS UNIVERSE. THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST INSTANCES THAT UBISOFT LEANED INTO THE IDEA THAT THEIR WORLDS WERE CONNECTED.
MONKEY ISLAND 2: LECHUCK'S REVENGE
RELEASED
1991
94

RYAN MCCAFFREYWHEN MONKEY ISLAND 2 CAME OUT, WE KNEW WHO GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD WAS, SO WE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT. OR SO WE THOUGHT. SOMEHOW, CREATOR RON GILBERT THREW EVERYONE FOR A LOOP, ENDING MONKEY ISLAND 2 IN A CARNIVAL, LEAVING US TO WONDER IF EVERYTHING WE'D PLAYED IN THE FIRST TWO GAMES TOOK PLACE IN A BOY'S IMAGINATION, OR IF THE ENDING ITSELF WAS SIMPLY ANOTHER LECHUCK VOODOO SPELL. REGARDLESS, THE STORY, JOKES, AND PACING WERE ALL TIGHTENED UP FOR THE SECOND MONKEY ISLAND, MAKING IT ARGUABLY THE BEST OF THE INCREDIBLE RUN OF LUCASARTS ADVENTURE GAMES.

DID YOU KNOW?
CREATOR RON GILBERT HAS NEVER REVEALED TO ANYONE WHAT THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND ACTUALLY IS.
THE AMBIENCE WAS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN RIDE AT DISNEYLAND.
THE AMIGA COMMUNITY DUBBED IT DISK JUGGLING SIMULATOR THANKS TO THE 11 FLOPPY DISKS IT HAD TO BE PLAYED ACROSS.
BURNOUT 3: TAKEDOWN
RELEASED
2004
93

JON RYANWHILE IT MAY NOT BE AS OLD AS SUPER MARIO KART OR ROAD RASH, WHEN IT COMES TO ARCADE RACERS, BURNOUT 3: TAKEDOWN IS AN UNDENIABLE CLASSIC. I MUST HAVE LOGGED 60 HOURS IN THIS GAME, AND THAT WAS WELL BEFORE THE DAYS WHERE I GOT PAID TO DO THAT. I DEFY YOU TO BRING UP ARCADE RACERS AND NOT HAVE SOMEONE MENTION BURNOUT 3. ITS PREDECESSOR, POINT OF IMPACT, HAD FINE-TUNED THE BALANCE OF HIGH-SPEED RACING AND VEHICULAR DESTRUCTION, BUT TAKEDOWN PERFECTED IT.

THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE GAMES YOU COULD EASILY LOSE HOURS PLAYING, EITHER ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS. AMONG OUR NERDY CADRE, THERE WAS NO GREATER SOURCE OF JOY, SORROW, OR WHITE-HOT RAGE THAN BURNOUT 3. FEW THINGS COULD RUIN A FRIENDSHIP FASTER THAN WRECKING SOMEONE'S RIDE JUST BEFORE THE FINISH LINE – THOUGH THANKFULLY ALL WAS (USUALLY) FORGOTTEN DURING THE NEXT ROUND OF CRASH MODE.

DID YOU KNOW?
INTRODUCED THE "TAKEDOWN" MECHANIC, WHICH WENT ON TO BECOME A BURNOUT STAPLE.
THE ONLY BURNOUT GAME TO RECEIVE A "T" ESRB RATING, SINCE IT WAS DEEMED TOO VIOLENT FOR AN "E," AND THE "E-10+" RATING HADN'T BEEN CREATED.
THE CARS ON THE COVER ARE THE MUSCLE TYPE 2, MUSCLE TYPE 3, AND SUPER TYPE 2.
FALLOUT 2

DAN STAPLETONSTARTING THE JOURNEY OF FALLOUT 2 AS A TRIBESMAN WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A LOINCLOTH AND A SPEAR TO MY NAME AND GRADUALLY FIGHTING MY WAY UP TO A POWER-ARMORED, GAUSS-GUNNING KILLING MACHINE IS A FANTASTIC AND SURPRISINGLY NATURAL FEELING OF PROGRESSION – ONE THAT FEW GAMES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MATCH. EXPLORING A VAST AND OPEN POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD FULL OF DEADLY RAIDERS, SUPERMUTANTS, AND DEATHCLAWS IS DAUNTING BUT EXCITING, AND THANKS TO ATTENTION TO DETAIL, ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC, POWERFULLY WRITTEN MORALLY AMBIGUOUS QUESTS, AND VOICE-ACTED INTERACTIONS WITH KEY CHARACTERS, THE WORLD FEELS PERSONAL AND VIVID EVEN THOUGH WE VIEW IT FROM A DISTANT THIRD-PERSON CAMERA.

IN FACT, IT’S A GAME YOU HAVE TO REPLAY JUST TO APPRECIATE HOW FLEXIBLE AND OPEN IT REALLY IS. I’VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES, EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WAYS IN WHICH DIFFERENT CHARACTER BUILDS AND PERKS WOULD DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE WAY EVENTS UNFOLDED, FROM KILLING THE FINAL “BOSS” USING STEALTH TO PLAYING ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITH A CHARACTER SO DUMB THEY CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE THROUGH GRUNTS. PLUS, YOU NEVER KNEW WHEN YOU’D STUMBLE UPON RANDOM EVENTS THAT WOULD SOMETIMES DELIVER GAME-CHANGINGLY POWERFUL ITEMS. FALLOUT 2 WILL SURPRISE YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN.

DID YOU KNOW?
CASSIDY, ONE OF FALLOUT 2'S COMPANIONS, SAYS HE WAS NAMED AFTER HIS DAD'S FAVORITE COMIC CHARACTER – LIKELY PROINSIAS CASSIDY FROM PREACHER.
THE UNIVERSALLY-HATED TEMPLE OF TRIALS TUTORIAL DUNGEON WAS A LAST-MINUTE ADDITION PUBLISHER INTERPLAY FORCED THE DEVELOPERS TO INCLUDE.
THERE'S AN EASTER EGG – AS IN, A LITERAL EASTER EGG – HIDDEN BEHIND A PILE OF GARBAGE IN THE BASEMENT OF THE NEW RENO GUN SHOP.
UNDERTALE
RELEASED
2015
91

MIRANDA SANCHEZA SMALL CHILD FALLS INTO THE WORLD OF MONSTERS AND SUDDENLY FINDS THEMSELVES THE TARGET OF AN ANCIENT GRUDGE THAT CALLS FOR THEIR DEATH. UNDERTALE PUTS THE PLAYER IN A UNIQUE SITUATION; WHERE YOU'D USUALLY KILL EVERYTHING IN YOUR WAY, UNDERTALE GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO SPARE EVERY MONSTER YOU MEET, THOUGH IT NEVER REQUIRES IT. EVERY MONSTER KILLED OR SPARED ALTERS SOMETHING IN THE WORLD, WHETHER IT BE ANOTHER MONSTER WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR FRIEND, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HILARIOUS DATE, OR A SLIGHTLY EASIER TIME WITH A SPECIFIC MONSTER'S BULLET HELL BATTLE. UNDERTALE IS JAM-PACKED WITH EMOTION, CHARM, AND DETERMINATION TO SHOW THAT YOUR ACTIONS MAKE A DIFFERENCE, NO MATTER HOW SMALL YOU THINK THEY MAY BE. PAIR ALL THAT WITH AN INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK AND CHALLENGING BULLET HELL BATTLES AND YOU'VE GOT ONE INCREDIBLY MEMORABLE GAME.

DID YOU KNOW?
SANS AND PAPYRUS ARE NOT ONLY NAMED AFTER THE FONTS COMIC SANS AND PAPYRUS, THEIR DIALOGUE IS WRITTEN IN THEM TOO.
WHILE ITS SOUNDTRACK FEATURES 100 TRACKS, ONLY 13 ARE ORIGINAL. THE REST ARE REMIXES.
A HANDFUL OF CHARACTERS WERE DESIGNED BY KICKSTARTER BACKERS, INCLUDING MUFFET, GLYDE, AND SO SORRY.
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS

MIRANDA SANCHEZLEAGUE OF LEGENDS EXISTS IN A MAGICAL PLACE THAT LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN INTENSE COMPETITION AND FUN AND ENJOYABLE STRATEGY. THOUGH THERE’S A LOT TO MASTER WITH A ROSTER OF NEARLY 130 PLAYABLE CHAMPIONS, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS IS EQUIPPED WITH GREAT MODES THAT MAKE THE MOBA EASY TO LEARN, YET IS STILL INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AS PLAYERS SCALE THE COMPETITIVE LADDER. WHILE THE EXCELLENT SUMMONER’S RIFT STANDS AS THE PRIMARY BATTLEGROUND FOR COMPETITIVE PLAY, THE OTHER MODES LIKE ARAM, OR ALL RANDOM ALL MIDDLE, ALSO PROVIDE A GREAT MEANS FOR A FUN CHANCE TO PRACTICE WITH CHAMPIONS FOR WHEN THINGS GET TOO TENSE.

DEVELOPER RIOT’S INITIATIVE TO REBOOT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS’ LORE HAS ALSO MADE IT MORE CAPTIVATING ON THE NARRATIVE FRONT AS WELL. EACH NEW CHAMPION OR CHAMPION MAKEOVER IS PRESENTED WITH SUCH BEAUTIFUL PAGEANTRY THAT IT’S DIFFICULT NOT TO GET SUCKED INTO CATCHING UP ON ANY LORE YOU MAY HAVE MISSED. WITH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT UPDATES AND A CONSTANTLY CHANGING ROSTER, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS STANDS AS ONE OF THE BEST COMPETITIVE GAMES IN EXISTENCE.

DID YOU KNOW?
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS CURRENTLY HAS 140 CHAMPIONS AND COUNTING, AS OF MARCH 7, 2018.
IT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED LEAGUE OF LEGENDS: CLASH OF FATES.
THE PRIZE POOL FOR THE 2017 LEAGUE OF LEGENDS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP WAS $4.59 MILLION.
MEGA MAN 3
RELEASED
1990
89

ZACH RYANMEGA MAN 3 TOOK EVERY LESSON THAT CAPCOM LEARNED FROM MEGA MAN 2 AND EXPANDED, REFINED, AND REMIXED IT. THE THIRD GAME IN THE SEMINAL SERIES BROUGHT MEGA MAN INTO THE 90S IN TRUE BLUE BOMBER STYLE, RETAINING THE CHALLENGING PLATFORMING (THOUGH, NOT THE TOUGH AS NAILS VERSION SEEN IN THE ORIGINAL) AND INCREDIBLE BOSS BATTLES THE SERIES HAD BECOME KNOWN FOR. WHILE TAKING ON NEW ENEMIES LIKE SNAKE MAN AND MAGNET MAN, OUR PLUCKY ROBOT HERO MANAGED TO LEARN A FEW TRICKS THAT WOULD BECOME MAINSTAYS FOR FUTURE GAMES IN THIS, AND THE MEGA MAN X, SERIES. THE SLIDE ABILITY GAVE MEGA MAN A MUCH MOBILITY UPGRADE, AND HIS FRIENDLY ROBOT POOCH, RUSH, ALLOWED HIM TO EXPLORE GREATER HEIGHTS AND FIND MORE HIDDEN SECRETS THAN IN ANY OF HIS PREVIOUS OUTINGS. MEGA MAN 3 ALSO MARKED THE APPEARANCE OF PROTO MAN WHO’S SHORT ARC ESTABLISHED HIM NOT ONLY AS MEGA MAN’S OLDER BROTHER BUT ALSO A SERIES MAINSTAY AND OCCASIONAL FOIL. THERE’S A LONG RUNNING DEBATE AS TO WHETHER MEGA MAN 2 OR MEGA MAN 3 IS THE DEFINITIVE NES MEGA MAN GAME, BUT FOR OUR MONEY IT’S THE THIRD INSTALLMENT, HANDS DOWN.

DID YOU KNOW?
WHILE MANY FANS CONSIDER IT THE BEST GAME IN THE MEGA MAN FRANCHISE, MEGA MAN 3 IS KEIJI INAFUNE'S LEAST FAVORITE FROM THE CLASSIC SERIES.
MEGA MAN 3 DEBUTED TWO MAJOR CHARACTERS IN THE – RUSH AND PROTO MAN.
THIS WAS ALSO THE FIRST GAME WHERE MEGA MAN COULD SLIDE.
SOULCALIBUR

88

CHRISTIAN HOLT SOULCALIBUR IS THAT RARE SEQUEL THAT SUPPLANTS THE ORIGINAL. THE SUCCESSOR TO 1995’S SOUL EDGE, SOULCALIBUR PERFECTED THE FORMULA FOR 3D WEAPON-BASED FIGHTING GAMES. A SMASH-HIT IN ARCADES AND THE FIRST “MUST-HAVE” GAME FOR THE DREAMCAST SYSTEM, SOULCALIBUR IS REMEMBERED FOR ITS BALANCE, IMAGINATIVE CHARACTERS, AND SMOOTH COMBAT. IN THE FLOOD OF NEW FIGHTING GAME FRANCHISES THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THE MID-90S, SOULCALIBUR SEPARATED ITSELF FROM THE PACK BECAUSE THE CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS WERE SO STRONG. ANY FIGHTER – WHETHER A NINJA, PIRATE, KNIGHT, OR WARRIOR MONK – COULD CHALLENGE ANY OTHER AND THE OUTCOME WOULD DEPEND ON THE SKILL OF THE PLAYER. THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS FANTASTICAL TALE OF SWORDS AND SOULS HAS SPAWNED SO MANY SEQUELS.

DID YOU KNOW?
THE DREAMCAST VERSION OF SOULCALIBUR WAS AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF A HOME CONSOLE PORT'S GRAPHICS EXCEEDING THAT OF ITS ARCADE ORIGINAL.
IT IS THE SECOND-HIGHEST-RATED GAME ON METACRITIC ALONGSIDE TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER 2 AND GRAND THEFT AUTO IV.
YOU CAN PLAY THE DREAMCAST VERSION USING THE CONSOLE'S MOTION-SENSING FISHING ROD CONTROLLER.

BRENDAN GRAEBERTHIEF II TOOK EVERYTHING RIGHT ABOUT STEALTH GAMES, AND THEN ADDED A DASH OF STEAMPUNK-INFUSED MAGIC. DEVELOPER LOOKING GLASS STUDIO CRAFTED A BELIEVABLE WORLD WHERE TECHNOLOGY WAS ON THE RISE AND THE MAGIC OF THE OLD WORLD WAS ON THE RUN. ADDING TO THE MIX WAS THE PERFECT ANTI-HERO WHO WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVING THE WORLD UNLESS THE END OF THE WORLD MEANT NO MORE HOUSES TO STEAL FROM.

THIEF II GAVE THE PLAYER ALL THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE PERFECT HEIST, ALONG WITH INTERACTIVE MAPS FOR WRITING NOTES. IT REWARDED TAKING YOUR TIME, AND OF COURSE, LISTENING TO SOME OF THE BEST GUARD BANTER IN ANY GAME TO DATE. SILENTLY SPRINTING ALONG ROOFTOPS, DUCKING THROUGH SECRET MANSION PASSAGES – THE GAME DIDN'T JUST MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A THIEF, IT MADE YOU FEEL LIKE A MASTER OF THE CRAFT.

DID YOU KNOW?
THIEF FANS ARE KNOWN AS TAFFERS, BASED ON A FICTIONAL SWEAR WORD USED TO REFER TO THIEVES IN THE GAME UNIVERSE.
ITS STUDIO LOOKING GLASS STUDIOS ALMOST BANKRUPTED MID-DEVELOPMENT AND SLOW ROYALTIES POST-LAUNCH FORCED IT TO CLOSE JUST TWO MONTHS LATER.

SIMCITY 2000
RELEASED
1993
86

CHRISTIAN HOLTSIMCITY 2000 MAY NOT BE THE MOST COMPLEX OR ORIGINAL OF THE CITY-BUILDING SERIES, BUT IT’S DEFINITELY THE MOST ICONIC. THE SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL SIMCITY IS A BEAUTIFUL, FUNNY, DETAILED SANDBOX THAT GIVES PLAYERS CONTROL OF A HUGE, CUSTOMIZABLE MAP THAT THEY CAN MANAGE HOW THEY SEE FIT. YOU CAN BUILD THE PERFECT METROPOLIS – SEE LITTLE SAILBOATS IN YOUR MARINA AND CARS ON YOUR STREETS, GET A STATUE BUILT IN YOUR NAME, KEEP YOUR ADVISORS HAPPY BY BUILDING MASS TRANSIT AND HOSPITALS. OR YOU CAN BURN IT ALL TO THE GROUND WITH CATASTROPHES LIKE EARTHQUAKES AND ALIEN ATTACKS.

COMPARED TO THE OTHER ENTRIES IN THE SERIES, THE GAME HITS THAT PLAYER AGENCY SWEET SPOT SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’RE EMPOWERED TO SAVE YOUR CITY WITHOUT BEING OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR SIMS HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY AND WATER, BUT ALSO THAT THEY’RE SAFE, HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, AND THE ROADS ARE MAINTAINED. AS YOUR CITY GROWS, YOU’LL HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS LIKE MASS TRANSIT, ENTERTAINMENT, AND THE ECONOMY BUT THE DIFFICULTY CURVE NEVER FEELS TOO STEEP, AND SUCCESS ALWAYS SEEMS JUST A STADIUM AWAY. PLUS, THERE’S NEVER BEEN A MORE SATISFYING FEELING THAN ZONING A LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL AND FIRST SEEING PEOPLE MOVE IN.

DID YOU KNOW?
BEFORE "RETICULATING SPLINES" BECAME AN ICONIC PHRASE ON THE LOAD SCREENS IN THE SIMS, IT WAS COINED AS AN INSIDE JOKE FOR SIMCITY 2000.
ONE OF THE DISASTER SCENARIOS WAS DIRECTLY INSPIRED BY THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRESTORM OF 1991, WHICH DESTROYED DESIGNER WILL WRIGHT'S HOME.

JOE SKREBELSWITH THE MECHANICAL ABANDON OF A MARIO GAME AND THE WORLDVIEW OF WERNER HERZOG, INSIDE SPENDS ITS THREE BRILLIANT HOURS OF LIFE HOLDING THE PLAYER IN A LOOP OF INTRIGUE, DELIGHT, AND DISGUST.

PLAYDEAD'S BLEAK, GORGEOUS PUZZLE-PLATFORMER BUILDS ON ITS PREDECESSOR LIMBO IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES – HELLO, COLOUR PALETTES; GOODBYE, BORING GRAVITY PUZZLES. IT LEAVES US WITH A GAME THAT SLEEKLY, WORDLESSLY PIVOTS FROM BRAIN-TEASER TO BODY HORROR, UNTIL HITTING AN ENDING THAT RANKS AMONG GAMING’S BEST, A MASTERPIECE OF ANIMATION, DESIGN AND OUTRIGHT STRANGENESS.

INSIDE’S QUIET GENIUS LIES IN HOW THE PUZZLES CREEP BEYOND ITS EVER-CHANGING CHALLENGES, AND INTO ITS STORY. I’VE SPENT AS MUCH TIME OR MORE WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANS AS I DID PLAYING THROUGH. IF YOU’VE PLAYED, YOU UNDERSTAND. IF YOU HAVEN’T, YOU NEED TO.

DID YOU KNOW?
MUSIC FOR INSIDE WAS CREATED BY RUNNING SYNTHESIZED SOUNDS THROUGH A HUMAN SKULL. VIBRATIONS CAUSED MOST OF ITS TEETH TO FALL OUT.

JARED PETTYSAY IT WITH ME: “UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, START.” THE MOST ICONIC SECRET IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY BECAME A LITANY FOR THE MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO JOINED BILL AND LANCE ON THEIR QUEST TO DESTROY RED FALCON. WHILE A TRULY SKILLED PLAYER CAN CLEAR CONTRA ON A SINGLE CREDIT, THE POWER OF THE THIRTY LIVES CODE GAVE ALL OF US A FAIR CHANCE TO POWER OUR WAY THROUGH THE GAUNTLET OF ALIEN INVADERS, OR MORE LIKELY DIE TRYING.

CONTRA WAS ONE OF THE FEW COOPERATIVE VIDEO GAMES OF THE 8-BIT ERA WHERE PLAYER TWO DIDN’T FEEL LIKE A BURDEN DRAGGING YOU DOWN WITH EVERY STEP. WITH PLENTY OF WEAPON DROPS TO GO AROUND AND HORDES OF ENEMIES COMING FROM EVERY DIRECTION, A PARTNER’S FIREPOWER WAS A WELCOME ADDITION IN MOST SITUATIONS. AND IF A FRIEND COULDN’T KEEP UP THE PACE ON THE WATERFALL LEVEL, YOU COULD EASILY INCENTIVIZE THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS BY SCROLLING THE SCREEN UPWARD AND KILLING THEM, WHICH I DID WHENEVER MY LITTLE BROTHER LAGGED BEHIND.

DID YOU KNOW?
THE NES VERSION'S USE OF THE KONAMI CODE TO GRANT PLAYERS 30 LIVES ALSO POPULARIZED THE ICONIC CHEAT AMONG NORTH AMERICAN AUDIENCES.
ITS NORTH AMERICAN LOCALIZATION CHANGED THE SETTING FROM THE YEAR 2633 TO 1987, THE YEAR THE ARCADE VERSION DEBUTED.
THE UK VERSION CHANGED THE HUMAN CHARACTERS INTO ROBOTS.

BRENDAN GRAEBERWHEN TONY HAWK PRO SKATER CAME OUT, IT WAS LIKE NOTHING ANYONE HAD EVER PLAYED BEFORE. IT JUST FELT SO INSANELY INTUITIVE, IT HAD GREAT MUSIC, IT JUST FELT… COOL? GAMERS, SKATERS, HESHERS, POSERS, THERE WAS NOT ONE DEMO THAT WASN’T DRAWN INTO THE CULTURAL SINGULARITY OF GAMING AND SKATEBOARDING LIKE A RENT-A-COP TO A SKATE VIDEO SHOOT. WHEN TONY HAWK PRO SKATER 2 CAME OUT, AND IMPROVED UPON THE ORIGINAL IN VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE WAY IMAGINABLE (EVEN MORE FLEXIBLE CONTROLS, AN EXPANDED SOUNDTRACK, MORE UNLOCKABLE SECRETS, CUSTOM SKATERS, EVEN A PARK EDITOR!), THE POPULARITY OF THE GAME JUST EXPLODED IN A WAY THAT COULD ONLY HAVE ENDED IN STEADILY DIMINISHING ANNUAL RELEASES. BUT FOR ONE SHINING MOMENT, WE ALL COLLECTIVELY AGREED THAT THPS2 WAS, AND STILL IS, THE PERFECT SKATEBOARDING GAME.

DID YOU KNOW?
THPS2 WAS BUILT ON A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ENGINE NEVERSOFT USED TO CREATE THE VIDEO GAME TIE-IN FOR THE BRUCE WILLIS MOVIE, 'APOCALYPSE' — THE PITCH DEMO FOR THE ORIGNAL GAME FEATURED BRUCE WILLIS' CHARACTER MODEL ON A SKATEBOARD.
NEVERSOFT ALSO DEVELOPED THE 2000 SPIDER-MAN GAME ON PLAYSTATION, SO NATURALLY THE WEBSLINGER SHOWED UP IN THPS2 AS A FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SKATER COMPLETE WITH HIS OWN UNIQUE SPIDEY-MOVES!
THE ORIGINAL PS VERSION OF THPS2 FEATURED AN UNLOCKABLE CHARACTER, PRIVATE CARRERA, BASED ON THE ADULT FILM STAR ASIA CARERRA. IN THE DREAMCAST AND XBOX PORTS, THIS CHARACTER WAS REPLACED BY THE LESS SALACIOUS (AND PRESUMABLY MORE FAMILY-FRIENDLY) "TRIXIE".

WORLD HAS STREAMLINED THE CYCLE AND MADE THE INTRODUCTION INTO MONSTER HUNTING MORE PALATABLE FOR NEWCOMERS ALL WITHOUT WATERING DOWN THE DEEP ACTION-RPG MECHANICS LONGTIME FANS LOVED MOST.

WITH 14 UNIQUE WEAPONS THAT ALL CONTROL ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY, ENDLESS ARMOR CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS THAT CHANGE MORE THAN JUST FASHION, AND INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT (BUT FAIR) FIGHTS THAT REWARD PLAYERS WITH AN INCOMPARABLE SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD IS IN A WORLD OF ITS OWN WHEN IT COMES TO ENDLESS REPLAYABILITY AND CHALLENGE. ADD IN THE FACT YOU CAN HUNT WITH YOUR BEST FRIENDS, AND YOU HAVE A RECIPE WORTHY OF THE MEOWSCULAR CHEF HIMSELF.

LUCY O'BRIENRESIDENT EVIL 2 REMAKE REDEFINED WHAT A ‘REMAKE’ COULD BE. FOR PLAYERS NEW TO THE GAME, THIS WAS A METICULOUSLY CRAFTED SURVIVAL HORROR EXPERIENCE THAT FELT COMPLETELY IN STEP WITH THE GENRE IN 2019, WHILE VETERANS GOT TO ENJOY A LOVINGLY CRAFTED PIECE OF NOSTALGIA THAT VITALLY, FELT LIKE THE GAME THEY REMEMBERED FROM 1998. IT TROD A BRILLIANT TIGHTROPE, CAPTURING THE INHERENT WEIRDNESS OF THE ORIGINAL - THE BAROQUE ARCHITECTURE AND LABYRINTHIAN ENVIRONMENTS THAT FLIPPED THE BIRD TO LOGIC - WHILE UPDATING THE CONTROL SCHEME TO A FLUID OVER-THE-SHOULDER CAMERA FAR MORE SUITED TO THE WAY WE PLAY GAMES TODAY. THE RESULT WAS UNEASY BUT NEVER FRUSTRATING, SUBVERSIVE BUT FAMILIAR. ALL REMAKES SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS ONE.

DID YOU KNOW?
CAPCOM WANTED TO INITIALLY REMAKE RESIDENT EVIL 2 IN 2002, BUT SERIES CREATOR SHINJI MIKAMI WANTED TO KEEP EVERYONE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENT EVIL 4.
THERE WERE NO BATHROOMS IN THE ORIGINAL RESIDENT EVIL 2 POLICE STATION; THEY WERE ADDED IN THE REMAKE.
MODS HAD A LOT OF FUN TURNING THE RELENTLESS MR X INTO VARIOUS OTHER CHARACTERS, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO), THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE AND PENNYWISE THE DANCING CLOWN.
