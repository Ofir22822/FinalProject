It’s great
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is my favorite installment in the Call of Duty franchise. It portrays deep realism and also some of the harshest aspects of modern combat. Marines have said that this is the most realistic video game ever. This game has a very compelling campaign that has a lot of heroism that demonstrates the bravery of our veterans. I would say if you’re over 13, you can thoroughly enjoy this game. Although it’s much worse in real life, this game does have some rough language and of course some blood, as it is realistic to real life. I’d also rate it this high because it really plays with your heart, you have to make very tough choices in combat. You have to choose who’s life to spare and who’s to take. In one mission, you find a house we’re half are hostages and half are terrorists. The hostages and terrorists are very difficult to tell between. You must choose when to shoot and when to hold your fire. It does make you feel bad when you accidentally take out an innocent. Overall, this is a great game but you have to be wise in what you put in your mind at what age, I’m a Christian and this game didn’t hurt my relationship with God, I hope you enjoyed this review and that it helps you make your decision.

Really good game, for a specific age range.
I play this game often, and I think it is amazing. It depicts the world of what our modern-day soldiers have to go through. However, it has alot, and I mean, alot, of violence. It isn't suitable for kids under 12, due to the graphic nature of both the campaign and multiplayer.

It's a normal call of duty with a slightly darker campaign
Call of duty modern warfare is a very standard call of duty game with normal amounts of violence, very softcore gore and blood, and a decent amount of cussing.
Now the thing about this game is the campaign. In the campaign you deal with things such as proxy wars, terrorism, and chemical warfare.
There are a lot of mature levels in it such as one where a car bomb goes off in Piccadilly square, and one where you have to clear out a house containing innocent people.
It's a very well done campaign but just might be a bit to mature for younger children.
Other than that it's a pretty great game, the multiplayer itself is fine for most ages and its just really fun. As always it depends on the child and how mature he or she is.

anyone can play this game as long as they're mature enough. your kid will hear much much worse language in school. teens and tweens are generally extremely nasty and dirty minded. as for the violence part, who cares. if ur son is a retard who talks about killing people with machine guns and stuff like that in public then dont allow him to play. other than that this game is BS! the plot is so stupid. idk why theyre showing the russians as pure evil when the americans werent any better. stupid plot about evil russians with weapons of mass destruction. it messes up the image of captain john price.

Despite its flaws, I absolutely love this game
Modern Warfare is my favorite subseries in the Call of Duty Franchise. I like the more serious and (relatively) realistic approach to the gameplay. I was super excited when this was announced, and honestly. I am not disappointed with the result. In terms of presentation, the game is amazing. Gunplay is top-notch and feels excellent, the sound design is impactful, and the customization is vast. Graphics and animation are extremely detailed. The campaign is great, with a tighter story, grittier tone, and smaller scale action. But it's also why I think this game is recommended for 14+. The Multiplayer is standard content for a FPS (blood spurts, possibly toxic players, privacy concerns, etc), but the campaign has some very disturbing moments and explores mature themes not seen in most single-player shooters. There are a lot of things that bother me, maps aren't very good, weapons often don't load in at the gunsmith, the campaign is a bit too short, and it has microtransactions in a full-price game. Overall, this is one of the best shooters on current gen consoles (as of 2020).

Awesome story line ( campaign)
I’m going to focus this review on the campaign because I know that lots of people are going to do a multiplayer review.

It is a bit griddy and I definitely would NOT recommend it to any
one who is not mature or old enough to Handel it but is a awesome story line and there are lots of great role models.players track down stollen gas and there are lots of good plot twists,and I grew up on the first cod games so that’s saying lot.And what commen sense said about shooting civilians is sometimes true.but it’s almost never on purpose.if you play FPS a lot you have to have fast Game reflexes and your brain thinks it’s just another ai or player.
That’s going to end my review.
Remember I would Not I repeat Not let anyone who is not mature enough to play this

Please don't
Please don't let your kids play this game! This is too much violence. If they grow up playing this, it will affect their behavior! :(

Campaign review: Big upgrade in terms of narrative and cutscenes
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a reboot to the original Modern Warfare series. With new gameplay feel and look, this reboot aims towards a more cinematic feel. The story is pretty good and the characters are very much likeable. The narrative could've been a little better as well as the dialogue. Missions still feel like previous Call of Duty games, with typical shoot em up segments that happen so frequently, that it's the main and only gameplay pillar (besides a few stealth sections).

Violence is pretty intense. Cutscenes or key story moments as well as gameplay can contain some horrifically violent moments. Not gonna go too deep on it, but a few one scene shows a suicide bomber taking out blowing up a section of London.

Language is strong and frequent. Use of "arse" "f#!k", "f#!king", "$h!t" and "b#!ch" are heard in dialogue.

A pretty accurate review.
This game truly isn't too bad. You can disable gore and swearing, and only play the multiplayer. The campaign is where the violence really happens but most kids want this game to play with their friends in multiplayer. Please take this into consideration!

Very cool, VERY violent
If you have a child who can handle some gore, and violence, then maybe let them play it. You can always turn off gore if your on PC, and the campaign doesn't need to be played for anything. It also has a mature content warning for good reason.

It's fine if your kid knows about war and knows not to say curses.
Okay, so first off. This is a perfectly fine game, with a little excessive swearing and such. The violence is fairly low, the worst being people strapped in bomb vests (civilian). The game helps children understand war, and the role models are great. In most of the game, you are a member of task force 141 trying to save civilians from "Al-Qatala" , a terrorist militia. You'll see many heroic actions preformed which provides great role models. Okay, now for the worst part. The consumerism is high, with a single operator and a few guns you'll most likely never use bumping up to 20 dollars. The battle pass is fairly cheap, and I recommend it. Although if you want an Allegiance (Russian) skin, you'll have to pay up quite a bit. Surprise purchases are very easy without a parent's permission warning or anything.

Anyways, that's my opinion. Just make sure your kid understands war, and won't swear.

Review is garbage
Modern Warfare very accurately depicts what war is really like and I feel like children should know what the real world is like.

Review the age rating
This game is fine for most ages. multiplayer 6+ but the campaign is at least 11+ check the options you can turn off dismemberment and game chat. It is an amazing game definitely worth the price!

So underrated
I think that I may be gory but I do not think that it should be rated 18+ because there isn’t that much gore

Very disturbing imagery
Ok so I think most of the game is pretty disturbing like the mission where your a child and you see your dead mother in a cut scene or where your tortured it’s really disturbing to me anyway it was great story just I felt uncomfortable during most of it just because of how loud and I guess disturbing it all was you have to hide under a bed from soldiers and stab them that was super stressful for me and it made me super uncomfortable otherwise really great game I would check it out if you had the opportunity

Campaign good for 13+. 12+ really should stick to multiplayer.
The campaign does carry some heavy themes that could scare younger players. Some of these things are shootings in city streets, a torture scene, and hangings. 13+ could take this type of things but younger players can not. If you yave a 12 year old who wants to play the game try to steer them toward the online multiplayer.
