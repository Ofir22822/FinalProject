emotional puzzle game might traumatize you if you aren't used to death
It is an inspiring story of an astronaut launching into space to save earth from an energy crisis. There is no gore but I should note that there is some references to violence and in one of the rooms there is a hologram that shows one of the main characters being stabbed by a screwdriver. There is a body bag with a bloody handprint next to the part where she gets killed. But other than that it is a brilliant game that gives me chills just thinking about it. It is an emotional tale that if you a sensitive find a different game! (I recommend outer wilds). I loved it but it might not be suitable for children. I should mention there is a little language but nothing horrible.

Awful
Footballers hook up with prostitutes and when you’re a football manager you don’t have the option to reply to complaints from stupid bitches like me

Beautiful, Fun Adventure
Trine 4 is a gorgeous game, I felt like I was stepping into some fantasy world, or some Harry Potter movie. The Nightmare Prince character could be frightening for young children, but it has about the same level of scariness as a typical disney movie. No mature content and great positive ... continue reading

Original and beautiful!
Concrete genie is amazing. I am someone who prefers games with action so I thought that this might be a boring game. I was wrong; very wrong. I found myself painting everything, spending more time than I should in areas just for my satisfaction. This is a very good game and you should check it out!

Its Sooo Good!
Way better than the original, which despite its flaws i felt was kinda underrated. The step back to 2D really lets the devs tighten up thier platforming and level design; free of filler content and floaty impreciseness of the open areas/mechanics of the original. Thats all you need. The gameplay may be familiar but the level design is truly unique and absolutely brilliant. If youre gonna imitate, imitate the best; not the soulless AAA machine. No innappropriate content.

Scary, disturbing, but a good game
The game is a great mystery but there are parts that include jump scares and disturbing imagery. Fear of the dark is a big part of the scare factor.

Best Wii game ever!!!!
My daughter Emma, 9, loves this game. She loves the graphics and especially the destroying element. Don't be confused she's a complete girly girl but she loves destroying everything she sees in the game. It was highly fun for all and would absolutely recommend!!!! Especially if you're a Ghostbusters fan like we are!!!!

Great game if you're not too young.
This game is a must have for any Ghostbusters fan... however I will address the one concern I have for kids and tweens. I think you should be at least 13 to play this because there are some scenes in the game that are just down right scary. I mean... it's not F.E.A.R scary or Deadspace scary but it's scary. For example you go to the hotel Sedgwick and have to get this ghost of a "Spider Witch". She had been a serial killer from the '20s who murdered men she brought up to her room. That kinda freaked me out as I have a fear of spiders... lol. And there is some frightening (if sometimes humorous) dialogue and scenes in that part.

Overall... if you're kid is 13 and likes Ghostbusters (and can say "I ain't 'fraid of no ghost" and mean it... it's for him/her.

A great game for kids ages 8+! The violence in this game is not going to be a major influence noting that the weapons are sci-fi ghost guns!
