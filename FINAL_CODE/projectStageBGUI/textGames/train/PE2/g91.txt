Completely unobjectionable
The only reason I put 5+ is because I'm not sure if anyone younger could get down the controls (or if I'd let them handle my Switch).

Instant hit
My 6 year old son who has a mischievous streak was able to live out his greatest fantasy of playing pranks on people albeit as a goose. He laughed so hard and got really involved trying to sneak things past the groundskeeper. Though the puzzles were a little bit beyond him and he did get a little frustrated with the controls. At one stage he felt sorry for the groundskeeper so be of mind the goose is an absolute pest to people so theres no positive messages here. But for pure unadulterated fun and mischief this game is spectacular in its delivery.

Good fun
Really clever puzzles that work well for all ages. Kids love being sneaky goose. The goose behavior is certainly "bad" but in a very playful pretend way. A huge hit in our home

SO FUN!
its the best puzzle game ever no one talks in the game so no languge there is no sex or romance so cross that and no violence you cant interact or see other players ( I think) there is no consumerism (again I think) its not extactly easy to play the controls are hard to control the game is just about being a goose and cause a lot of trouble I recommend if your looking for a great puzzle game!

No violence stealth game!
Finally! A stealth game without any shooting or violence! Untitled Goose game may sound stupid but I think it's one of the best games to come out in 2019. This game hasn't got any role models or great message but it's a stealth puzzle game so it has got some educational value.

A Very Unique Hidden Gem of Third Party Producers
This is such a unique game on so many levels as no one has never made a game like this. As you are a goose who's a jerk to people, it's a really fun change of things in video games. My only problem would be that it's not as long as I had hoped, but that's okay because that should be expected from a smaller production company. I highly recommend especially if you're looking for something different and unique

Nothing they have not seen
This game is a masterpiece, a mix of horror and battle royale. It really challenges you because if you die you don't just lose some stats you lose that kit and hunter. This keeps the game interesting as you always have to be on high alert. This games only factor is violence/horror. In this game there is blood but no gore. All the things in this game you will see in most 12 rated films these days. Overall I highly recommend this to any young FPS player.

the only problem with it is that you need apple arcade to play, which costs money and is like a subscription

NHL 20 review
Don't bother giving EA another 85$for a roster update,they can't even get that right. The game is full of old bugs and glitches, an being the same game for the whole PS4 generation it's downright embarrassing.

Improved hockey game with some violence.
I have recently got the game and, to be honest I love it! There is something for everyone and it is unlike other EA games with the fact they don't try to make you buy everything. It is very positive and easy to play. It has a bit of fighting but nothing that will desensitise you. There are positive role models and it gives you a lot of satisfaction when you win a game. Parents, this game is fine.

Actually not bad
It does make you buy a lot of in game stuff to make your hut team good but if you don’t care about that and only care about beating other teams with your team and this game is perfect because you basically do whatever you want you make your own team become a pro become a GM all and all it’s not a bad game it is a little pricey though

NHL 20
I think that NHL 20 is just like a hockey simulation, so there is of course a little bit of violence. I think if you enjoy hockey you will love this game.

Great game easy to play. But since it's a game by EA you could spend thousands of dollars on in game purchases.
