This is because violence is animated and not super realistic. The language is also not terrible and the dialogs are fun and by the end of the game, you have a whole storyline!

Phenomenal game, extremely enjoyable
Let me first say that this website is a joke. The reviews made by common sense provide no help whatsoever, as no context is provided with any of their descriptions, which can make a lot of content seem much worse than it is.

Great Game
I have a son who just got this game and he is 12 years old. I have watched him play and it seems fine to me. I would recommend to kids in middle school and older. There is not that much sex even though it says it was high.

AWESOME
Borderlands 3 is really good. The violence in it that it’s so fast paced you don’t even care about the explosion of the enemy you just killed because you’re on to the next on. The swearing has only 2 f bombs. There is no nudity or sex, however there is a mission all about winning this ma ... continue reading

I have an 10 year old and a 13 year old, that both adore this game. It may seem bad but its nothing worse than anything your kids have seen in movies. I recommend this game for at least 10+.

Borderlands 3 good for kids?
Yes borderlands 3 is fine for 11+ you may think “oh this game a
Has too much swearing or blood and gore” the thing is that if you don’t have subtitles on and don’t have noise there’s no swearing and blood and gore you can turn off in the settings menu. If you think what about the sexual themes we’ll boys take off there shirts or stuff like that but nothing bad.Plus some characters are good role models because they stand up for themselves and show that it’s ok to be different or to make your own path. This game is like a pg-13 movie

This game is fantastic, and common sense media is completley wrong!
You can compare the violence to Team Fortress 2. Language isn't too bad, but your kids hear way worse everyday at school. A few sex jokes, but nothing that couldn't be in a PG-13 movie. Honestly, the "expert review" is wrong and kids 12-13 and up could easily play this. (It's much better than getting them games like Grand Theft Auto or Call Of Duty)!

I have 3 kids and sometimes play myself and from my review it has no bad sides, the violence is Cartoony and fun and I watch my kids play and its fine. I would highly recommend this for kids ages 12 plus as it is pretty much perfect in every way

Not for kids! But not 18+!
In my opinion, common sense has no common sense.
To parents,
I wouldn’t say it’s for kids, I would say it’s in the 15-17 age range. Body chunks are left behind and characters are killed gruesomely. There are several sexual references. And parents, this is gonna sound very crazy, but if your kid is highly mature and will get these funny references, it will actually make the game more friendly. Several F-bombs are dropped, but that’s really nothing to worry about. If your child is looking for a good game, this shouldn’t be there number 1 option. Thank you, again.

The Best.
On the outside, it looks super gritty with a tone inappropriate for kids, but if you think your teenager is mature and will be responsible, you are fine. It’s fun no matter how old you are, and after playing through twice, it would be fine for anyone 13 and up.

an explosively great time!
Borderlands is an FPS RPG where its all about the loot. You get that loot by killing enemies and bosses with some pretty imaginative weapons. Enemies will lose limbs, get their head shot off, get electrocuted, get corroded, etc. With that being said, the game is done in an art style called cell shading. This means that it looks similar to how a comic book would. Enemies explode into clouds of blood and gore. Language isn't horrible. Nothing explicit is said that wouldn't be allowed in a T rated game aside from the innuendos. Sex jokes are common but will more than likely go over a kids head. Overall, it is a super fun experience that is even better with friends to enjoy over and over again. I know that when I have kids that I will be having them play this series. Its one of my favorites.

Borderlands 3 is a great game. It is extremely fun with a memorable art style... but there is violence... in the game you shoot many enemies but most of them are creatures like demogorgan dogs and giant insects shooting them with funny weapons such as guns that shoot burgers, the true problem for the game is the games rating.

Violence and suggestive themes
The game is violent in a very cartoonish way. It has some suggestive content and the characters swear from time to time but the only major swearing is from a character named BALEX

There is a setting to turn off gore
The game is mainly for adult because of all the pop culture references, gore, innuendos, and language, but you can change all of this by TURNING of the gore setting, putting the volume all the way down for the language, and talking to your kid about the characters and how they can be used as role models(the hero's not the villains) The game tells you to go your own path and chose your own way. This game is good if you want to take a step to let your child more free.

Really?
The Common sense reviewer admits to the games extremely overt sexual banter, but then applauds it for not discriminating against it? That's like saying "Sure, he had his pants around his ankles, but he gave a friendly hello as we walked by." There is literally a murdering contest in the game to see who gets to 'sleep with' someone with countless descriptive sexual references that are shameless and unapologetic, and this goes on throughout an entire mission. Kids have NO business playing this game and there is no option to turn it off. Nuff said.

Aside from that, the majority of the time the game just desperately gets you to like it with nonstop jokes, some are funny and many of them get tired as it is a shallow, nonstop parade of pop references and bits that actually become tiresome at times. You feel some "guilt by association" along the way as you play the game and enjoy the gunfights but have to listen to the white noise of frequent juvenile nonsense. It's too bad you can't opt out of the dialogue, but there are so many cameos and celebrity voices in here that they are going to make you hear it. Like it or NO.

The GOOD though. Never has there been a 'looter shooter' with so many weapons, so much of which feel very exotic, most of which you obtain through playing the main game and campaign. There is ALOT of gore, but you can turn it off and it is NOT just bugs and aliens as another reviewer said, it IS mostly humans actually. The enemy types aren't endless, but there is adequate variety and some interesting boss fights, some of which are more powerful and others more minor and simplistic, but boss enemies are a big part of the experience.

The movement is fluid, traversing feels intuitive, you can pull yourself up from a half landed jump, shoot while sliding across the ground and drive several types of vehicles. so mobility is better than ever and the guns have weight and good sound to each one with alot of variety. the only downside to the gun collecting was that they are NOT upgradable and become obsolete as you level up, so you never stick to one loadout for long. So with 3 skill trees for each of the 4 characters, trinkets, and weapons perks, you will grind with meaning and noticable improvement making this one of those games you can get lost in for what you think is a few hours, then you realize you spent your day somehow. It's a genuinely fun game and I never really liked Borderlands before. It's too bad I can't wholeheartedly encourage the game with the "in your face" language and highly inappropriate, gross sex talk.

As a side note, multiplayer is hard to pull off as players on different levels are rubber banded to meet in the middle for difficulty, meaning if you are the lower level player, you're going to feel pretty spongey and weak trying to keep up. Also, this game DOES have split screen 2 player, but it doesn't run as well and can be a bit laggie.

Violent and Mature but AMAZING game
I (a 13 year old) beat the game once, and loved the game. But, there is a lot of violence, and I felt that the low tire mode didn't help too much, and even felt depressing because you see the bodies you murdered, instead of seeing a blood splat. Also there's Bakex, who constantly swears, ... continue reading

Really fun but a bit brutal and inappropriate
This game is really fun, but there is a lot of violence and swearing. In the one side quest kill killavolt your goal is to kill other girls so you win the prize of being able to have sex with killavolt. They worst swearing is the b word and s word I haven't completed the game yet so I haven’t heard anything worse. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone mature enough to play and understand the topics.

Turn off Gore
I watched the original borderland games on youtube and they were pretty good, i liked the atmosphere, violence (which the gore can be turned off) weaponry, light story and nice visuals. I dont know how ease of play is it but i think it looks kinda fun. Good for teens

Is Violent But Gore Can Be Removed
Borderlands 3 is a great game. It is extremely fun with a memorable art style... but there is violence... in the game you shoot many enemies but most of them are creatures like demogorgan dogs and giant insects shooting them with funny weapons such as guns that shoot burgers or other over the top, cartoony things. When you get around three hours into the game enemies like human bandits are swapped with robots. The gore can be pretty brutal but with a quick switch of a setting it is removed and the violence goes down to the level in Star Wars or destiny 2. As for the language, there is barely any. The worst words so far are hell and sh*t, but are not frequent. The story is light and a refreshing break from heavy games like the last of us, it included funny jokes such as references to defeating warlords with Vaughn’s abs (who only wears underwear and a crusty cape).
Overall this is great game for anybody who can play Star Wars or destiny BUT REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE GORE!!!

Great game, with mature themes.
The game is very gory but has options to turn off blood and guts. There is hardly any foul language in the game with few exceptions. The graphics are not realistic and are in more of a comic book style. I think that if your kids are mature enough and over 13 this game will be fine for them.

amazing game other than very strong language
The overall point of the game is to put a stop to a cult called COV. The leaders of this cult are after a vault, which will give them weapons, and loot, and more power. Your goal is to go planet to planet to stop them from getting to the vault keys (which open the vault) There is some violence but the cartoonish style makes it not as bad. There is also a gore sensor option. What really makes this game rated M is the language. Through out the game there is about a cuss word per 5 minutes. The part where it gets the worst is with a character named Balex who uses the words: F*ck, B*tch, and Sh*t almost constantly. There is also a lot of very raunchy sexual innuendos. Overall, if you are old enough then it is an AMAZING game, but if you are to young then it could leave an impression.

Fine for middle school kids
It is fine for middle school kids that already know about sex and cuss words. It’s a fun game and people should not allow their kids play it if the experience worse at their school.

Well... What can I say. It is Such a good game. I havent finished it yet, but it is so good. LOADS OF VIOLENCE THOUGH. A bit of swearing. Loads of dismemberment and blood and gore. Some humor. Some suggestive outfits.

Borderlands is back baby!!!
Borderlands 3 is the fourth installment of the Borderlands franchise. With a new set of heroes, and a massive, and I mean MASSIVE variety of guns that it's crazy. Violence is frequent. You can play the game with gore on or off. Gore on: Dismemberment and frequent blood stains around the environment. Main characters jump attacks on enemies can result in a big splash of blood and gore. Gore off: Mild blood is still seen, with small bloodstains, no dismemberment. Language is occasional throughout the game. Use of "@$$", "b!#ch" "$h!t", "p!$$" and maybe two uses of "f#!k" are heard in dialogue. Sexuality is present. Some perverted innuendo and one female character's cleavage is mildly exposed. Some female characters are presented in a sexual manner.

I WILL WRITE A PARAGRAPH SO BE AWARE
The age of borderlands is way too high. Why is borderlands recommending to have the age of all of their games at MA15+ whereas fortnite the most competitive and addictive games with loud and swearing teens. Over the course of 10 years borderlands have upped their game where you can change the game to the way you like it starting from brightness and sensitivity to censoring gore. Therefore these games should be a lower rating.

Very good game.
Borderlands 3 is a fun, high octane shooter. It is violent, but if you have kids that want to play this, then no problem. You simply turn off gore by going to options, scroll down to gore, and press censored. After that, it has a little bit of blood left, but it’s the amount of blood in Overwatch. Very fun. Boss fights can be difficult though. A little bit of swearing to, but nothing like Deadpool bad.

Gory but fun
Hello, first off this game can be mature at some points, Moxxi in particular. She wears clothing that shows most of her breasts and can say seductive things but it doesn’t go anywhere. Secondly, this game is gory, but not as bad as they make it out to be. Yes there are times when characters blows up in pools of blood and organs, but it doesn’t always happen and they use the same organ model for literally everything you kill. This game is okay for teens 13+

Great game but for this age
My relative told me about this game and told me that it’s like a game I play called destiny 2 and it was called borderlands. I played the first 2 games and then said this game seems really fun. It’s a bit on the violent side but if your kids are mature enough then let them try it out if not then don’t let them until the requirement. Some of the cursing is blocked in some parts. Gore splatters sometimes on the screen. If you parents are fine with your kids playing this game then go ahead.
