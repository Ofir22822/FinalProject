Same as other call of duty games.
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and rate games on common sense media.org. I noticed that commonsense media consists of many fake parent reviews and I want to start a movement for change. Please check my reviews on popular games, for trustworthy and informative reviews. This game is just like any other call of duty game. Same game every year. There is frequent profanity throughout including f**k, s**t, hell, damn, b*tch, and bastard. language is 8/10. Violence is constant, gore can be turned off. All shots result in some blood and RARELY dismemberment. Blood can barely be seen from far.(sometimes it can't) This game as always will get a 13+.

Call of duty Modern Warfare.. why its not that bad
I personally have taken time with my 11 y/o and my 14 y/o to play this game. We have one day a week that we play against each other, and have endless amounts of fun! Now about the gameplay and the violence... when you eliminate someone, its not like blood comes GUSHING OUT. There is a tiny bit of blood that drips onto the ground. The game has little swearing, and if swearing is a big deal to you and your family, I suggest turning the volume off so that you don't hear it at all. As far as roll models go, it has many. You are mainly a British Armed Forces soldier fighting off terrorist attacks in the campaign mode. I don't see the harm in that. It is teaching people what is right and wrong, and teaching kids about our world. An educational aspect of the game is, it teaches you a lot about guns. I myself just from playing with my children, have learned numerous guns, the country and military that uses them, and many many things about forgein militaries. There is no sexual content what so ever. I hope as a fellow parent, this helps you out.

Needs a powerful machine but is still a great experience.
M rated I don't think so. There is legit no gore and the blood is barely noticeable. Also, there is a setting called the turn of blood and gore which I told my kids to put, and they where like ok it doesn't matter there is no disadvantage. Yes, this is a shooter but shooters aren't unhealthy. Finally, the price I know this is a full-priced game costing 80 dollars Canadian and the game never goes on sale but for what you get its worth it. You get a full stories mode that will last at least a couple of weeks if you are very good at the game and at least 20 different game modes that change every week witch creates more of a diversity of things to do. to completely master the game it will take more than a year so 80 bucks of a year of gaming is yes for me and should be the same for you.

Not as bad as you think
At first my 14 year old son asked me for this game and I said no as it was rated 18+ and I thought it was violent. However after he told me that he could handle it I realised that I should take a look at it and put my self in his shoes to see if it would effect him. It’s not as bad as you think and although yes it does have blood in it I think some parents forget that (especially if they are a teen like mine) they aren’t a little kid anymore and as long as they have a loving family and home, will be fine.

Please read this.
In the campaign, it is violent, lots of curse words(f and s mostly), and bloody. It has a good story though. The multiplayer is not nearly as violent, and so much fun. You can customize weapons and have cool camps on them. There is a couple of calling cards that are bad. There’s 1 where it has a girl saying da f***, but that’s the only bad one, and is simi rare to see. Warzone is just like multiplayer in bad stuff but it is a battle royal game mode. Over all the game is one of my favorites and could be handeled by mature 11 year olds, but the Campaign should be played at 13+. Note that you can now disable the campaign. Just watch a video on it.

Gore can be turned off, gamechat can be turned off.
Some other adults are saying that gamechat and gore etc isnt good for your child, you can easily turn it off in settings, i would much recommend maybe 12 to 13. story mode 14 plus as it is gory swears often and is a bit old for children, if your child wants this game they probably want it to play with friends, it is a blast with friends and if you were to say no to them then theyd probably be missing out on fun with friends, after all lockdown can get boring

Amazing gameplay. Gives role models that most games can’t replicate.
I think most parents know that CSM overacts on games. Have you found one MA rated game on this app rated anything but 18. No you haven’t. So how about listen to a parent of three kids instead of them. I went to Oxford University if you are one of those parents that says “Oh he’s just some rando.” Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has positive role models, the campaign is about a anti-terrism organization working against a terrorist. Violence- this can be switched off easily in settings. Without it switched off there are some very gory instances. Language- Can also be switched off. Without it switched off there are a few occasional f-bombs and s-words and a other cus words. Suicide bombing part never killed anyone, you kill the bomber and defuse the bomb jacket. Some smoking and drinking, but I think a twelve year old has seen people drink and smoke. Sex- none of that. I have two sons and a daughter. I bought this for my son because he said you could switch off the bad stuff. Turns out you can. I’m normally against single shooters because I saw a bunch of studies on how they affect children, but the shooting is against terrorists and you are saving people. You are told to not kill unless they are a threat. I bought this game because I love my children, if you love your you should buy it for them as well.

Too scary for my 8 year old, 10 year old was fine
This game is very fun, but it is scary. There are many situations where you have to decide between your life or someone else's. There are terrorists killing civilians, and suicide bombings. Overall, its fine for anyone who can take it.

Great Game
I do think this game has role models, Farah Karim is a strong female protagonist. Playing at the age of 22 I found her storyline shocking and a bit disturbing, but I can appreciate the reality of situations like hers. The entire campaign storyline was extremely violent and graphic, not something I'd want my kids to play until at least age 16.

Definitely suitable for 13* kids.
I used to be big into shooters when I was younger. The call of duty franchise was always one I enjoyed, and one that I believe mature teens or possibly younger should be able to enjoy. I've seen several parents talk about the graphic nature of the campaign/story mode saying it's over the top and extreme, which I disagree with. The campaign portrays the British and American and some Middle Eastern forces fighting against terrorist group Al-Qatala. It can be graphic at times, such as showing a terrorist attack in London. Though it may sound bad, a young person should be able to deal with this and understand the situation. It does in no way glorify war and conflict. There are several Male and Female role models in the story who play big parts in the game. The multiplayer is a classic fps, with little amounts of blood simple, though challenging combat. It is a very enjoyable game, and one you should give a chance, as the media can sometimes over-exaggerate on these titles.

Great game
I bought this game for my 13 year old thinking its going to be a bad choice but i was looking at the settings and you can turn off blood and gore and its just a shooter like uncharted and its a great to socialize because theres teamwork involved and its great for the situation we are in right now.

AMAZING MY KID LOVES THIS GAME!!!
Hello Parents.

You have probably come to this website because your youth will not stop bugging to let them play this game. Whether it be that all their classmates have it or not, I would like to shed a little light on this game.
It's obvious that Call of Duty games might be a little more on the violent side, but as a fellow parent, I can assure you that it's nothing too bad. Yes, there is blood. Yes, there is gore. But one day your kid is going to witness it all in the world wide civil war. Trust me. It will happen.
All jokes aside, people often tend to pull Call of Duty in the category of games such as GTA or some other game. There is no need for this over exaggeration. Surely you don't want a kid that passes at the sight of blood. This will tough em up. :)

La'Quchiaua Loves You! &lt;3

THE MEDIA IS WRONG
This is a good game for anyone above the age of9 with the content filters on. These content filters get rid of all bad language and gore bar the cut scenes that you should tell your child to skip. LOTS OF LOVE KAREN SMITH. The media is wrong about this game and I trusted them. In short do not trust the media about any video games. Or video game consoles. Video games enrich your child's life experience especially this one. KAREN SMITH APPROVES
