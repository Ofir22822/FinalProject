Awesome game, 9+
This game is great and fun to play with friends. It's not very scary, even though it's rated as "horror". The scariest part would be the neighbor, who you have to avoid in order to beat the game. You also have to find a set of keys. The game is very cartoony and not graphic. When the neighbor catches the kids, they fade away into a pile of missing posters, but as I said it's cartoony and not going to scar your kid for life. Think of it as when Thanos snaps the avengers into dust, to put it that way. Online chat is there, but you can mute people.

Scary-ish Mystery
It’s a who done it murder mystery and in this wacky hello neighbor spin off you use teamwork and trust to survive the neighbor’s wrath!

OMG stop giving this scary ratings
THE ADULT IS WRONG(the one who posted the 13+) the neighbour is not creepy whatsoever otherwise it would be a pegi 12. But it is not it is a PEGI 7. This is a fun game to play. I said 7 and up for people who don't mind scary things but even if you get creeped out by a lot of things this would be a solid 9 or 10 yr. Most people ignore when kids give ratings BUT THIS IS TRUE.



Thank you.

This game isn’t as much of a horror game as it seems
I’ve been watching my son play this game for the past few months. Usually he plays with friends and seems to enjoy the game; as parent I decided to see what the game was about. I was curious on what the game actually was; so I asked my son, about the game. I soon realized that the game was horror game. As a parent I soon got distressed on the fact my son was playing a horror game. I soon did a bit of research (and by actually playing the game) learned about the “horror” this game supposedly had. The game revolves around 6 kids. These kids have to find 6 keys (depending on how many) around the map too unlock a hidden door. The “horror” of the game is the neighbor who tries to capture all the kids before finding all the keys. When you’re caught the neighbor picks up the kid (in a very cartoonish way) evaporating the kid into nothing. The only scary thing is when the you finally in counter the neighbor. Nothing a kid couldn’t handle. The actual game is very cartoony and is a blast to play. Most kids around the age of 9 can easily handle this game.

Fun depending on how you play
Looking on the other reviews of this game, it has come to my attention that some believe this game is "too scary, and full of horror." The truth is, a kid can handle it. No kids would ever get nightmares or have bad thoughts by the intention of this game. All this game is about is kids working together trying to solve puzzles while someone is trying to capture them. No blood, no gore, no language, and being captured by the villainous neighbor isn't brutal in any way. Online chat can be used but can easily be turned off.

very fun game, recommended for young tweens and older.
this game is really fun, but a little confusing on xbox one because there is a cursor on the screen. otherwise a fun spin off game for fans. although, the game is scarier then hello neighbor, and hello neighbor hide and seek. But hello guest is extremely scary( which hello guest is theroyized to be hello neighbor 2). and this game can have players talking into the microphone so you can hear them. although you can mute them, it takes time so a bad word or two might be heard. and the controls are really different from the first two hello neighbor games, otherwise not nearly as glitchy as the first two games either, which is great. also, one last thing to note is that you can spend real life money in the game for items you want so consumerism report! anyways This game is scary but very, very, fun to play.

A good Game
I think this is a great game. It is really fun to play and has creative and funny characters and names. I do not think there is anything inappropriate but if there is anything I missed very few kids would see it or understand it.

Too much sex
Too many sexual references for small children, my 16 boys were all shocked by the graphic content in this game.
