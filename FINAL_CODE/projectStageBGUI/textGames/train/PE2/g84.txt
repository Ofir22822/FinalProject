Overwatch!!
This game is sooooooo fun! For it's genre, it is not THAT violent. The only problem is that some of the characters (or heros) are very dark themed. Overall, this is a games rating speeks for itself.

Great game, but violence is basically all about it.
There is consistent violence and the going into the war genre, but I believe this is a step up from ten year old shooters, and a step down from call of duty. There is no swearing, but the whole game is based around violence, but I believe a mature eleven year old, or someone twelve or older should be allowed this game.

Overwatch IS great
I'm not saying that kids should start playing video games at an early age, I'm just saying that if your 5 year old wants to play it, let him/her play it.

This should be a PEGI 7.
Nowadays games are rated too high. This is one example!

Amazing game!!! I highly recomend it to your tweenage kids!
This game is rated teen probably because it's a first person shooter. But don't let that make you think it's a horrible game. There's barely any blood and there's no cursing. One character is constantly smoking a cigar, but other than that it's perfectly fine for tweens and up.

MMO is content short, but in total a blast
Overwatch is an MMO with no campaign and dozens of heroes to choose from. There is some violence when you shoot another hero, but the graphics are cartoony and there is only blood for a millisecond when you shoot someone. Some profanity spoken by the heroes, but it is usually no worse than hell or damn. There is an option where you can talk to other people on chat. Some of the female heroes have skimpy outfits. Also some heroes have more moral principles than others, but they all kill to get their war. In total this game is content short, but fun and addicting

Great Game. PG Rated. With Consumerism
Great Game. Appropriate for many ages. If your kid can watch PG movies then you're kid can play this game. If you're under 7 then it's probably not a good idea.

Concerns for young kids: Lootboxes can cost money if you want extra.
The chat and voice chat is open.

Great game for all those who have a PlayStation 4, XBOX One, or PC
I think that Overwatch might be the best, friendly shooting game out there! The characters are fun and colorful and it's easy to pick up and play. The only problem is that kids can listen to what others over the internet have to say and sometimes thats not a good thing. There's definitely a few kids who will give out personal info which isn't ok. As long as your child is smart enough to not give or personal info this game is ok for them.

Strangers, Kids play with adults.
It is a great game, diverse characters, teaches you to strategize and improvise, and more! There is a bit of gore, and some characters can be revealing (tight clothes, v-necks) but it's pretty minor. Make sure your child doesn't play it too much, explain to them that its not real life, and how violence isn't good, etc... if you're concerned, its rare for your child to be like that, but it does happen. Monitor the play time and you should be fine. One other thing, be careful as this is a multiplayer game, people can chat, and they swear, a lot. If you use voice chat, you will find most players are adults. Other than that, I love the game, Haven't had any problems, and most people are really friendly! Though I very much think that no child under 10 should play this, I know from experience, it can be a toxic place sometimes. PLEASE be careful talking to strangers.
The community is nice, but searching up images will get you very inappropriate things, lots of sexual drawings and more. I'm not concerned about the violence, but the people you play with.

Mild violence and slight behavior change, but great overall
The main point of the game, Overwatch, is to be able to work as a team to defeat the enemy team in a certain objective. After months of playing this nonstop for a few months, because this game is addicting (Consumerism), I have become very competitive on this game. This has changed my behavior with the game - angrier and more judicious of how others do things, because people don't know how to play the game, even in competitive mode - and has caused me to *attempt* to swear at my team. Yes, attempt to. In the Xbox and PS4 version of the game, players are usually not connected to the voice channels, thus making communication between players nonexistant. (Be careful if you're on the PC version, because it's much easier to voice chat here) Next topic Marker..... Though, Blizzard has made a decent solution to this; a wheel of communication, where players can say "Group of with me!" or greet them, etc. So, I can still somewhat communicate with my team, despite me not being able to use voice chat. Next topic Marker..... Overwatch is very mild on the violence compared to other titles similar to it; While you are still killing each other on the battlefield, no blood is ever shown, unlike games like Battlefield. Next topic Marker..... If you were to play in the game, you would know that there's this system of "Loot Boxes," where you can open these up to get 4 random items. In a way, this is gambling. I have heard many stories of people buying 50+ loot boxes at once and spending a ton of money, so be careful if your child has your credit card information. They might buy some without you noticing. Next topic Marker..... In the lore of Overwatch, (youtube.com/users/playoverwatch), many characters are looking towards justice (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwFu8kEsUW4) and others look to disrupt them. The good people, as we shall call them, are very positive role models because they are basically your fairy tale "Heroes," they're the teacher to the student, they're the Romeo to the Juliet, etc. Children can always look up to the "Good Guys" of this game. Despite the choice of character design.

Game that keeps on being fun!
Overwatch is a team based online exclusive game that continues to be fun.
Most parents are most likely turned away by the first Pearson perspective and guns but in all honesty the animation resembles Disney and there is no blood.
I have only played Overwatch on my XboxOne so I was a bit annoyed that I had to purchase XboxLive but in the end I wasn't dissapointed.
If you have a decent computer then that is probably your best option but playing on the Xbox or PlayStation is still incredible and is by far one of my favourite FPS games, up with Halo which I would suggest as an alternate to Overwatch if you want something different.
Hope you found this useful have fun!

No age restriction needed.
I don´t think that there´s a problem with this game when it comes to violence. There is no such thing as blood or gore in this game. it´s probably one of the most tamest shooters i´ve played. If you have a kid who knows how to hold a controller and likes cartoons this is the game to get. The gunplay is very very cartoonish and less vionent than most of the cartoons on Saturday morning TV. this game doesn´t deserve an age restriction and 13+ is just silly... the only problem i had with the game is that it didn´t hold my attention for a long time due to the lack of a campain. but as this sight is meant to age suggestions that´s kinda of topic

Awesome
The Overwatch is an internatonal group of heroes fighting to save the world. The game introduces this story but does not follow it in the gameplay. In the game you play online with two teams. You can choose a hero and fight for your team. There are different groups of heroes that help out the team in different ways, such as support heroes who dont do much damage but can heal players on theyre team. There is an online voice chat, and I have run into some people who swear or say other questionable things but you can turn off the chat if your worried for your kid. The game itself isint that violent. There is a little bit of blood but its pretty rare and its a small amount. The blood is hard to notice in the fadt gameplay. The characters are awesome, and make you feel as awesome as them when you play. The game does not have level advantages so its all skill based witch might make the game harder for younger kids. There is a little language but VERY light and sometimes in different languages. The heroes are from all around the world so its cool when they have an accent or even speak another language! Its a great message for kids and a great game!

Fine for kids ages 11 and up
Overwatch is a first person shooter game where you play with other people online to complete objectives such as holding an area or moving a payload. The violence in the game is very cartoony and non-realistic. Most of the guns do not even shoot real bullets. There is a bit of blood, but it is very fake looking. If your kid is age 11 or older then Overwatch should be fine for them.

Not that violent but voice chat is main problem.
This is easily one of the best FPS games out now. I play on PS4 but still a lot of people play. Some of the female characters are over sexualized. The game has positive messages said by characters and has a good lore behind it. But voice chat should be the main problem. I've been told to shut the f!ck up and people say sh!t and d!mn a lot. I don't care what people say personally. You also have the option to mute players before the match. Also you must have Playstation Plus or Xbox Live to play! There is no single player. Its a good game though and 10 year olds could play it but 12 year olds for voice chat.

High quality amazing game for beginners and people who have friends in the FPS community
I love this game and think it's awesome and a lot of fun. If you have a problem with chat just mute your TV and don't let your kids go on the chat. I would recommend playing this with friends as that really elevates the experience. The game isn't that violent but it can get frustrating.  ... continue reading

It's alright
I think the game is very cartoon styled but is heavily borrowed off.of a game called TeamFortress2 but gameplay wise is nothing lIke TeamFortress2. The character selection is all broken down into groups offensive, defensive, tank, support. The characters are also known as (HEROES) characters have their special ability known as your (ULTIMATE) ability giving characters special advantages or assistance for your team. Heroes in the game by its self have difficulty rating certain characters take a lot of time to master and some are just plain easy to master and are what you should probably start with when first acquiring this game. Me I played this game.for a bit but I got bored of it and went back to Destiny I'm waiting for more content to start coming out. There are cosmetics and voice Lincecum and gestures that take much time to earn from lootboxes. LOOTBOXES can be purchased with real world currency but just lootboxes everything else has to be earned from playing.

Never gets repetitive!
This is a great game. I have played for hours on end, and it never gets boring. Many different gamemodes, a competitive ranked system, only downside is that other players often curse, but there is a chat filter.
