Fifa is Football
How could you not let someone play football? Fifa is a great game, every year EA do a great job. I know, yes, it costs a fair amount of money, but i feel the game is enjoyable, i play against my son on the PS4 and i ensure we have a good time while regulating play. When he gets good grades i occasionally get him a bit of FIFA points as well. There is NO bad language, with no chat function, and in no way violent, sexual, or related to drugs and alcohol. It's easy to play and quite fun, even if you're an adult!

Really recommend for soccer fans!
This game is very good for me. First time I ever played FIFA was the 2008 game which came out in 2007. At first the controls are kinda complicated, but you will get used to it! You can also change the controls settings which is very helpful. Career mode is really cool you get to create your own player or choose a real one. It gives the perspective of a soccer player career. There are several modes that are also as fun to play! This game deserves its five stars!

Angry and Frustrated son
I bought FIFA 20 as the previous versions of the game have been great, career mode is good for kids to play football and learn about the game and understand different strategies.

This verion comes with the FUT champs game, which i understand was in other versions but my son never played. He has been playing FUT champs in the last few months and the only way to progress and compete appears to be via paying a lot of $$$ to get good cards/players. He also gets angry and frustrated when playing, you can be ahead for 90% of the game and suddenly lose in the last few minutes.

Having read forums this appears to be a common problem with the game.

One of the best games in Playstation History
I say 3+ cause a 2 yr old wouldn't know how to play!!! Other than that, it is very good!!!! Positive messages and role models and I love Ángel Di María on FIFA 20!!!!!! No violence or anyhting, just pure and lovely football with fantastic graphics

Could be better.
Well... It is not the best Fifa I've played. The speed thing in Fifa 19 was fixed but that's kind of all they fixed. The scoreboard constantly crashes and the score disappears. Career mode is so unrealistic. If you have a team of the best players ever, they could be beaten by Ajax. The character creator is cool. There is so many more options like running style, etc. But even if everything is maxed out at 99 on a custom character, he/she won't have 5 star skills. Being a person that loves creating players, this is so disappointing. The only way to get him/her 5 star skills is mods, and I'm not doing that. Volta is Ok, too. So overall, not the best Fifa, but it's ok.

Horrible
The amount of 18+ content in this game is unbelievable worse than some of the Call of Duty's. My kids have been scared for life and are still in therapy.

Fun but can be pay to win sometimes
I think it is a good game for children who are into sports and football and the game is really easy to become very good at against the A.I. but be warned I've had a fair share of online predators and swear bombs on the online section

Excellent fun! Recommend to all ages!
Great fun! Exactly like a proper match just on a TV Screen. Controls take some getting used to which is why maybe kids younger than 8 would struggle but otherwise it's an excellent game.

The game itself seems to know tons about the sport and more. You can create your own ultimate team, your own player or players, and there's an online chat which you can use as well.

All in all a brilliant game for anybody who's used a controller before. PlayStation, Xbox and Windows. 10/10 for me.

Waste of time
Absolutely horrible game. They’ve recycled the same game for 5 years now and at this point there’s no use buying the newest game. Very strong theme of gambling too. You can buy fifa points to open packs in hopes of getting good players. However, it is usually a scam and you end up getting bad ones. The point of it is to keep buying packs using real life money until you get a good player. I wouldn’t recommend at all

Fantastic family game
Great for everyone yet it takes time to learn the controls, perfectly safe unless you use the online mode which includes voice chat which could be harmful towards smaller kids.

GREAT FOR SOCCER FANS!
There is nothing mature about this game. Any age could play it. The soundtrack also never fails to disappoint. Relatively simple to play. A bit too similar to the last one. But anyone who LOVES soccer is bound to enjoy playing this incredibly realistic game.

Fantastic game, that's a little more accessible than other Zelda games
Great game, and highly recommend it.

In terms of content and age appropriateness, all Zelda's have a darker 'big bad' behind them, than say the Mario games. So there's a little bit to consider there. Also the game ultimately involves slashing a lot of things with a sword, although no gore. Zelda also involves often loosely guided puzzle solving, that is more complicated than a Mario game. So for children who do not deal well with getting stuck for either a) boredom or b) frustration induced tantrums, I'd maybe leave it until they're older, and more able to figure out the puzzles (and therefore enjoy it more).

Overall, this is the most accessible Zelda game though.
- It's less dark - the bad guy is a bad spirit inside an egg. The menace is very minimal. I can't see this scaring the majority of children, whatever age.
- It's less violent - with more cartoony battles than normal. But I think it would inspire role-playing with pretend swords etc.
- It's easy to play - effectively 2D making control simpler to master, and the world is relatively small and self-contained. The puzzles are a similar standard to others though.

Personally, even with a budding gamer girl (age 6) I don't think I'll be reaching for Zelda until she's at least 7, probably 8. Mainly because I think she'd just find it too frustrating. It requires patience and persistence to enjoy. The violence/darkness is less of an issue with this one. The plot/setting is a bit cryptic as well, and I'm not sure she'd get it yet.

Great for Team Play
My son (5 1/2) recurved this game for Christmas. He had been playing Luigi Mansion 3 and loved it. So we thought he enjoy this too. Since he doesn’t read my husband and I knew we were going to need to help him. We helped him and he took off with it. He could do a majority of the game by himself. And when he got stuck we’d look up how to fix it or what he missed. There’s very little violence. No blood or gore. It was very fun for my son to play and replay!

A perfect remake
This game is absolutely amazing. The combat is simple yet sometimes challenging, the puzzles range from obvious to obscure, the story is completely amazing, this is a perfect remake. My only complaint is that Nintendo always nags you to buy Amiibo.

Bright, colorful remake of an original Zelda game.
The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening is a cartoonish remake of an old game for the Gameboy. Link is shipwrecked on Koholint Island, where he must gather eight instruments in order to wake the Wind Fish. Link does fight monsters on his journey, but the combat is very cartoonish. The only reason I say this game is 8+ is because some of the puzzles can be very challenging. Other than that I think this game is okay is 5-year-olds.

Great Game!
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was a challenging but fun game. Although the world was very small, there was always lots to do. The great story mixed with the very hard dungeons makes an amazing game. Although this game is probably very challenging for younger kids because of all the obscure but important details, and the impossible dungeons, this game is a treat. The Zelda series never disappoints! Overall, this is a wonderful game

It's a brilliant game with lots of puzzles to solve and adventuring. Some parts can be a bit hard to figure out though, but I don't think thats a bad thing!
