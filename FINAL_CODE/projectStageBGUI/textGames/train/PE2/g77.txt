It’s really not bad
TURN OF CHAT OPTIONS FOR TEN AND UNDER NOT SUITABLE INTHAY CASE but other than that it’s pretty good for people.

My Thoughts on Overwatch
The game is based off of a task force named "Overwatch" (hence the name) which is based upon protecting humanity from robots known as Omnics. Although the game contains a character with a cigar, nonetheless, it should have the Content Descriptor of "Tobacco Reference", rather than "Use of Tobacco". The game contains mild blood and gore, which is very unnoticeable. The game is, however, very toxic, so beware.

Edit: I forgot to mention that there are multiple uses of the word s**t,
but both are within reason after something negative happens to them.

Really fun game appropriate for all ages
I highly recommend this game if your kid wants to get into Shooters but does not have the experience for a game such as a Rainbow Six Siege the mechanics are great and really easy to play I love this game and I plant a lot and well there's close to zero mature content I am inclined to mention that there is a bit of violence but all of the weapons that character is used are some form of energy blaster and they're not guns and even if you're really against guns players still have the option to use other items however if you are a hardcore FPS fan I would not recommend this game for you because it will get boring for you fast I highly recommend this game for younger kids

overwatch
Overwatch is a online first person player game from Blizzard Entertainment where you chose a hero to eliminate enemies using gun aim and various skill. Each character has i own skill and special which is very useful will eliminating the opposition. This is a very fun game with lots of modes but it has some problem-- hack users.this user uses hack like aim hack, which makes them overpowered and it makes the game not very fun. I think this game will be even better if Blizzard blocks this kinds of hack. However I think Overwatch is a game that is worth its price if you have a great aim and great decision making skill. This game has great graphics, lots of mods, custom matches,and also ranked matches.I do not recommend this game if you do not have good aim or you do not like cartoon graphics. First this game can be very stressful if you can’t kill anyone because of your aim and secondly people have different types of game they like and if you are expecting something realistic this is not the game for you. If you like games like Fortnite then this is a game for you-- it has a cartoon graphics like Fortnite and it also requires aim like Fortnite.

Blizzard whirls up a banger!
Now, I’m a die-hard nintendo fanboy, but Overwatch has reeled me into the shooter genre with its in-depth roster and each characters unique moveset. It’s character system is like smash. Everyone essentially can do the same thing, but they do it in different ways. Only down side is the fanbase, NEVER, under ANY circumstances go there. Other than that, 9/10.

Super addicting
Great game, I've been playing it non stop.
Overwatch is a first person shooter containing different characters you can play as, each with unique abilities. For example, there are characters who deal mostly damage, there are tanks, and there are healers.
Parents should know there is open voice chat, but you can leave it if you want. The game is kind of strategic and some characters are unbalanced, which Is why i recommend this game to kids 11+, depending on their skills. But it's your decision. I think it's super family friendly. Only thing is tight skinned or a little bit of revealing outfits on some female characters, but nothing too inappropriate. You also don't really need to worry about your kid spending too much money on it, you get loot boxes containing at least 4-5 items every to you level up, and leveling up is super easy.

Nice game
The game is basically an online PvP shooting game with an anime/Disney-like art style,there is a good variety of charaters with different gameplay,there is no gore despite being a shooting game,a few female characters have revelating outfits,is not mentioned on the game,but Soldier 76 is gay and Tracer is lesbian,there are comics and animated shorts who explain the story of the game

One of my favorite games!
I'll start off by mentioning my background. I'm 17, got this game on my 16th birthday. My parents are VERY conservative and are absolutely appalled by gore and gun violence. Even as someone who is on the brink of early adulthood, and someone who spends their time gaming alone, they refuse to allow high-violence FPS (first person shooter games), or really most FPS at all. Same goes for something that is high in sexual content, be it with risque clothing or with sexual acts. But my parents actually approved of Overwatch, after researching it. There IS blood, but it is so small and difficult to see in the high, cartoony-action, that it isn't bothersome. Not all heroes use guns, and I find the game so enjoyable, pretty, and diverse that it's hard to put down. I will note that heroes will say "damn" in certain interactions, and if i'm not mistaking "hell" is also used. But that's it for language. Females wear tight clothing, but it isn't overly graphic. Only one hero currently reveals any cleavage, and it's pretty mild. The same character, "Widowmaker," is known for her voluptuous bottom, but it's nothing to be overly concerned with, in my opinion. All in all, I highly recommend this game. There is also interaction with other people which is always unpredictable unless you refuse to allow mic access, but the game is difficult without team communication. It is possible to find a team who does not use profanity. Children are often less good at the game, so I discourage younger ones to play competitive, but nothing stops them. Get this game for your child if you disapprove of violent or overly sexual games! You likely won't be disappointed.

One of the greatest online games ever.
This is one of the best games I've ever played. Overwatch is one of the greatest games ever and also one of the most fun games. It is a superb multiplayer game. It has beautiful graphics, exciting combat, and a great lore. This game is centered around combat, but it's not graphic, a small flash of blood at the worst, but it is constant. Some characters of both genders wear revealing outfits. No actual in-game cursing, but there is unmoderated open chat. This game has some DLCs and merchandise including comics, books, online character shorts, and they're even making LEGO sets. This game should be fine for tweens.

Light Violence, but fun to play
The game is based on two teams of 6 battling over a common objective, however there are many special gamemodes to choose from that change the gameplay. The player chooses from a roster of 25+ characters, each with unique abilities. The variety makes the game difficult to master, but players are usually good with only 2 or 3 characters. The weapons of the characters can range from a hammer to a machine gun, and when a character is shot they can bleed red blood. The violence is not very realistic though, and I think kids 11+ can handle it. Many characters also are fighting for good and the game encourages teamwork. Fun with friends.

Interaction with Other Players
Overwatch is very fun and colorful, with very mild cursing and no sexual content. I think the only concern to consider when purchasing this game for your child is the fact that it is multiplayer. There is an in-game censor that obscures foul language, but that is only in the text chat. If your child connects to the voice chat, there is no filter and some of their teammates are likely to curse.

Other than that, I highly recommend this game. It's been a great source of fun for me for years now!

Great game for teens and up.
There's nothing bad or inappropriate in this game. The violence is mild, there is no use of drugs, (except one character smokes a cigarette). However, the game has a voice/text chat that is required to use if playing Competitive Play. Competitive Play is, in my opinion, hard to understand to a 11 year old. So I think the game's rating is pretty spot on. Quick Play and Arcade gamemodes are much suitable for smaller kids. You can also come across some inappropriate custom games in the Game Browser but that's not really a problem.

An all time favorite
Overwatch is a friendly first person shooter game with epic characters. There is not that much blood in Overwatch. But sometimes when Soilder 76 gets hit he mutters damn it under his breath but that's really it in terms of swearing. There is no drinking or drugs in the game either. And some positive messages and good role modes.

Great game, but some things to know
This is a pretty fun game. There’s a lot of diversity in play, and actually no blood. The only curse words are a few “damn”s thrown around, but otherwise it’s clean. It does promote team play, which is great, but there is a problem in that it’s also an internet troll’s paradise. Players have access to both text and voice chat, so you can directly talk to other players. There is a profanity filter option available for text chat, but not for voice chat. You can mute and block players, however, so that’s nice. Players can also grief or throw games by not doing their part, interfering with allied players, and similar practices. Basically, you can say or do anything and it’s likely you won’t have any punishment besides a mute for a few days. That is most people’s problem with the game, at least when it comes to social features. But most of the time, you will find players who want to have a good time, just like you or your kid. Now, about the characters. There is one character, McCree, who smokes a cigar, and McCree and a few other characters reference alcoholic drinks, but none is actually shown in game. There is some fan service in Widowmaker (possible Mercy and Tracer, depending on who you ask), so just know that. There is so actual sex or nudity in the game. The game can also be VERY rage inducing. There are times that you may not be doing well, or your team isn’t communicating, and you just get mad. At those times, it’s better to log off and take a break. It’s also pretty addictive sometimes, so I would advise parents to set time limits. It’s for their own good. One last thing: there is a lot of consumerism. When a player levels up, they gain a loot box. Look boxes give you, well, in-game loot, like skins and sprays. But they are purchasable, and they cost a surprising amount, about a dollar a box. Since you can’t directly buy loot you want with money, you will need to either rack up currency, which takes a long time, or buy boxes, which give you totally random loot. This leads to many players buying a lot of boxes in hopes to get something they want.
Overall, Overwatch is very fun, but no game is without flaw. The seemingly uncontrollable social mechanics are a problem, as well as the consumerism, but otherwise I would say it’s fairly kid friendly. For these reasons, I’m giving this an age rating of 13+
