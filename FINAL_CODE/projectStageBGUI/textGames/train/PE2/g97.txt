Good game for teens
This game is good for teens. You start as an ape, the goal of this game is to evolve and become a modern human. The game starts in the jungles of Africa 10 million years ago. You have a clan and you can lead them, also you have to gather materials, resources, and food to survive. There are predators and animals that you have to watch out for in the jungles.

It’s not that violent
I’ve been playing the game for a year and there is almost no violence
And no swearing or drugs or sexual content so I think it is appropriate for 12 year old or over

Great Game.
The game is so fun. I think its for 12+. You see bodies fly sometimes but its like dummies. If you don't like crashing don't play because it's a demo derby game. Best demo derby game I've played. It gets 5 stars.

very good game, a bit violent
wreckfest is AWESOME! its so fun to smash, crash and bash crs! multiplayer is especially awesome, now this is coming from an 11 year old, there is a small bit of violence, on vehicles like motorcycles or lawn mowers, if you hit them a dummy will fly off. theres no blood/gore but they still fling like dummies. thats really all though, otherwise it's awesome!

Brilliant Smash'em-up
This metal grinding, car smashing extravaganza named wreckfest is an absolute blast to play and even watch from youtubers or just plain old chill'in on the couch kind of watching. The over the top wrecks and wounds from cars t-boning them is spectacular to see and gives out a satisfying feel to it. In my opinion, every gamer who loves to be destructive in games should 100% at least try this game in all its over the top, exciting glory.

Severe difficulty spikes may discourage casual players.
As you progress through the beginning of the first world the balance and challenge seem fair and rewards skill. However, very soon you are dropped into tight corridors and can be quickly overrun with hordes of enemies. The "dodge roll" is your only real evasive maneuver that you literally HAVE TO master for each enemy. There is a slowness and weight to your character that you cannot simply outrun enemies for long and you will be required to "Get Good" at this one go-to move. The game rubber bands difficulty (to a degree) so that new players can play with higher levels, but you will still be very squishy and weak in comparison much of the time.

So, if you are big into the Dark Souls level of difficult and lumbering gameplay, you will feel right at home with this title. But more casual player should NOT mistake this for another shooter like Gears or Division as you will most likely die several times over before defeating many of the areas and especially multiple times on the majority of the boss fights. Also, if you are totally new to this difficulty "genre" of other such titles, you may be frustrated and tempted to quit very early on. I played with higher level friends for the first week, but after a fresh attempt on solo. I quickly realized how much I was dependant on better players, but as a solo player or with Randies (random players) this game can be brutally difficult. Not sure if I would have bought it and invested the time had I known some of this sooner.

NOW, the good is that most of the bosses are interesting and there are a couple dozen different enemies as this game does not skimp on enemy types which keeps it fresh. The weapons are well done and feel good with fair hits and some interesting powerful weapons. You can also gain armor sets, each with unique and stackable perks and mods for your weapons (AKA Turret or minion summons, healing rifts and hive swarms). Much of the aquiring of these may have you looking up you tube videos as several of the puzzles for attaining the best gear are not obvious. It's a well done game with some memorable boss fights, but it can truly kick your butt throughout, and seemingly designed to do so..

The process of loading into a game took while but once you loaed in you would go around looking for contracts, what the contracts are is purple rockes that you have to pick up. The movement in this game was just amazing and the pvp was kinda anouying because everyone would fly up. The ... continue reading

the cycle
It is a really fun game for kids and teens. Some monsters may be scary for young kids but otherwise it is really fun. There are different guns and knives. There is no blood. but lots of violence. it has simple controls and great graphics.

Sophisticated and great-looking turn-based strategy game
If you're looking for a simple game, or an action game, this one is not for you.
This is one of the most sophisticated turn-based strategy games. It has a strategic level map and then a drop into tactical battle map.
The graphics are great.
There is much to learn. Mastering this game exercises your cognitive skills! I believe no one could say this game was 'mindless entertainment' that was a waste of time. If you believe games can be great learning and skill development exercises, this one is for you.

Just another generic walking+jump scare (TM) game
You walk around a drab house for 2 hours with mediocre/easy "puzzles", predictable jump scares, and occassionally run and hide from scripted monster attacks all while a dull story with poor voice acting plays out.

No inappropriate content save for a (child's?) severed head covered with maggots in one scene.
