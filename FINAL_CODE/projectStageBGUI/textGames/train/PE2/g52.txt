Dynamax Ruins The Game For Everyone
Note: I do not own a Nintendo Switch, and I do not intend to purchase one.

Parents need to know that SWSH does not feature Mega Evolution or Z-moves, gimmicks from the previous generations' metagames. Furthermore, transfer from Gen VII is currently not possible. Dynamax ruins the balance of Pokémon, and the new Galarian forms outshine other Pokémon. One good note about SWSH is at least Gyms had returned instead of Island Challenges. I give this game a 2 out of 5.

Long time fan and parent
Ive been playing Pokemon since 1997 and over those 22 years ive seen some big and small changes to one of the main game fraancises i love. I started out with the anime in 1997 and got yellow for my birthday the next year and have never looked back.

What I love about this francise is how kid friendly it is and some of the values it teaches of friendship and careing the anime values as well as every time anew game comes out with new pokemon it challenges the player even more to think stratagy and how this would work with this move and so forth. In other words get kids heads thinking and helping to learn how to stratagise.

A usefull skill to have in this everyday world. Now ive heard of the bugs and the glitches but im still looking foraward to really playing the copy my wife got me for christ,mas. and this thing about not all the pokemon being in it? Didnt red and blue just start out with 150? Besides pokemon home is comeing out next year and i dont think itll be forever that we will not asee the missing pokemon in game. After all dont they patch up games all the time and update them on the switch?

What im trying to say is if anyparent asks me the number one kid safe game to play my first answer is always pokemon. To me its the number 1 computer game for all ages for everyone to enjoy

An epic new adventure!
I'm just gonna start off by saying that while I thought $60 was a bit overkill, this game was definitely worth the wait. This game may not have had anywhere near a complete pokedex, but it had plenty of new pokemon of unique designs and movesets and two new legendaries to catch. The character designs and humor in the game was also very well done. The dynamax battles were very fun and engaging and the graphics were very beautiful and polished and definitely not glitchy. After beating this game, I have to say, it was a very enjoyable experience.

Still not worth the money but has been improved...
I'm a long time Pokemon fan but these games, which are the first main series games on a actual home console rather than portable are NOT worth $60 at launch. Having less than half of all Pokemon to catch is just a minor issue compared to the bad graphics and glitchiness of the games. And also do NOT get the download version because it can cause you to lose your SD card data because the game is very very glitchy. The games do not look much better than the older 3DS games and the online support is basically a pay wall. You have to pay money to play the games with other people online. There are Pokemon characters who are NOT coded into the game at all. You can't bring old legendary Pokemon from other games because their data doesn't exist in the games. So if you have a shiny Latias that you caught in Pokemon Go for example, you can't bring it to the new games. The starter Pokemon are shiny locked so if you are a shiny hunter you can't reset to get them shiny. You also cannot get about 400 or so other Pokemon because they are not coded into these games. In the 3DS games you could get 807 or something like that as of Ultra Sun and Moon. In these Switch games it's just over 400. These games cost $20 more than the 3DS games yet you don't get as much content. I regret buying Sword. I listened to good reviews from the game sites like IGN and gave the games a chance. And I totally regret it. I already have the game beat even though it is supposed to be a 40 hour game I had it beat in 14 1/2 hours. The game is just bad.
Edit: there are free updates and paid expansions that add more Pokémon both new and old. The games are getting slightly better but a companion app called Pokémon Home is needed to do transfers and adds some missing features back like GTS but it costs a chunk of change ($16 yearly subscription) to actually get any use out of it (it’s freemium with only enough free storage for 30 Mons). It’s been improved but it’s still not quite worth it. I will say it went from a 1 star to 2 and a half stars.

Overall, a solid game! Give it a try if you're starting out on RPG's or a Pokémon Fan in general.
As a veteran player, this game was on the easy side of the difficulty scale but is suitable for younger audiences. The game characters themselves tell the player character to expect the battling to get tough throughout their Gym Challenge, which is a nice touch.

Most, if not all, characters are lively and are friendly towards the player character. The rivals of the player character never have any ill will towards them for besting them in Pokémon Battles, and all strive to better themselves in a positive manner, which isn't at all uncommon to see in the Pokémon series.

If you/ you and your child care about the fact that over half of the Pokémon that exist aren't obtainable in the base game, fear no more, as the expansion DLC that is releasing in two parts, later this year (2020). The DLC is going to add in brand-new content, as well include AT LEAST 200 more obtainable Pokémon, some of which will contain returning Pokémon, a Pokémon with a new Regional Form, and completely new Pokémon. The DLC expansion pass is constantly advertised in a banner in the in-game menu, SOMEWHAT pressuring players to buy it, but the small banner could be temporarily (shows back up each time the game is booted back up, which could be annoying to some, not to me, really) turned off by clicking the Right Stick.

Now to denounce other people's reviews!

The review addressing the lack of gimmicks from previous games is kind of bunk, as it's simply "out with the old, in with the new".

The review speaking about characters "scantily clad with two-piece swimsuits" is also nonsense, as the "some characters" (the Water-type Gym Leader Nessa, the females of the Swimmer trainer class) only wear swimsuits that one would typically see females wearing at a pool and/or the beach. Nothing to be alarmed about, honestly.

Yes, the graphics could be better by today's standards, the story is simple to a fault, and there has been glitches and bugs reported, but nothing game-breaking. The smartphone app Pokémon HOME (releasing Feburary 2020) will help with the transfer of Pokémon from older games into this one.

good for kids, good for pokemon beginners, bad game.
there's no gore, no violence, sexual content ETC ETC
It's just not a good game. if you're a younger kid who just wants to collect pokemon and be the champion and all, this game is perfect, but for anyone who wants anything more, try another game like black and white or ORAS. they ruined "shiny pokemon" (rare special versions of pokemon that required often hours of work to acquire) by making it as simple as one person spending an hour or two, then upwards of 30 shiny pokemon being generated, and they refused to patch the glitch that caused this. the story is abysmal, the one in the previous games (sun and moon) was great! but they didn't try this time. It's also way too easy. I played through the entire game and only lost once, which would be ok if it was still a long game, but it's not. if I lost every fight it would still take me about 10 hours to beat the game, it's just way too easy. if you're looking for an easy, simple game try this one, but for a good, enjoyable game maybe go for the fan favorites, (black and white, diamond and pearl, heart gold and soul silver) or my personal favorites (omega ruby and alpha sapphire (ORAS)

No gore and super kid friendly. The Pokémon battles can be challenging, but I was able to beat them all on my first try. As long as you like Pokémon and know how to use a switch controller, you will love this game.

This is literally the BEST video game I've ever played.
Totally worth the money.
It also has a great DLC!
And the best part is that it has a whole continuation of the story Post-Credit.

It's a fun game, but is harder to control for younger kids. There isn't too much to do after you complete the game, unless you buy extra stuff.

First of all, I've played almost every Pokémon game since Red + Blue
The game is enjoyable, but compared to old entries to the series, I found it quite dissapointing. Most of all, I disliked the pacing of the 'story', because it all happens in the last 10 minutes of the game.
If you want to play Pokémon, you should probably just get Sun + Moon instead, they're better in my opinion

It’s Super Effective on the Pokémon Fans!
I have Pokémon Shield myself, and I think it’s pretty good! The animations for Pokémon moves aren’t really scary or violent at all, and the gameplay and story is fun, but yeah, the idea of training animal-like creatures for combat is a little extreme, but parents shouldn’t not get this game just because of that. But on the other hand, if you don’t know your types or aren’t used to Pokémon and battling other players online, it can be a little frustrating, but overall, if your kids are Pokémon fans, it’s a good game to get as a present, and is easy to learn how to play.

Wonderful!
I really love playing this game, the graphics are great, the camping and cooking minigame things are cool, the story is pretty good but almost the same as other games as far as I can tell. These games help younger folks learn about the value of teamwork and such. Also the Dynamax mechanic is cool

PS Im sorry I have no grammar skils whatsoever

Great Game
This is my favorite Pokémon game, I do miss mega evolution and some other things from previous generations, I don’t see why this game has lots of hate, but besides that, this game is for kids but with some very mild problems that just depends on your Conscience, this is a short swim suit outfit that you can get from beating the 2nd Gym (Nessa) which is revealing, there is also no filter to names, so you will definitely find some inappropriate user names while in Internet connection mode but honestly that’s it, this is a great Pokémon game for people new to Pokémon, tho I don’t agree with the price (59.99 USD$) I still love the Pokémon franchise

This game also has inspiring messages and a great story, and you can learn good lessons form this game

Yet another great Pokémon game!
I wouldn't consider myself a super fan of the Pokémon series, but I have taken a liking to the games. I've played many of them, but I have never seen a game as beautiful and smooth-running as this.

The game follows the story of your character and his/her rival, Hop, questing to become the newest Champion of the league.

I haven't finished the game as of when I post this, but so far, it is the best Pokémon game I have ever played. It has an amazing storyline and positive messages about never giving up and trying your best.

The only thing I would say is that only kids 8+ should play this because firstly, the controls are a little bit complicated, and secondly, there are some mildly scary scenes that I think anybody 6 or under might be scared by.

But aside from that, this is the best Pokémon game I, personally, have ever played. The developers really did a great job.

Yet another Masterpiece!
The game Pokemon Sword/Shield is a adventure/role-playing game where you explore, challenge gyms, and most importantly: catch Pokemon! If you are not entirely sure what Pokemon is, Pokemon is a game that was made in the 1990's that is practically the same as this game other then the fact that there were way less Pokemon then there are now. Honestly, this game is really good, the animation and graphics have received a very much needed update from its previous titles. (There are many different titles in the Pokemon franchise) The story is pretty good compared to some of the previous games, but not the best. The pokedex has a even number of 400, which is awesome! Something that they added to the game that I love is the wild zone! The wild zone is an area that you are free to explore whenever you feel like it, so kind of like a open world area. One thing that has not really changed over the years is the Pokemon battling, it is very cartoon-like and not very graphic using a rock-paper-scissors style of battle. Overall I must say this is a fitting game for the Pokemon franchise, If you are a hardcore fan or new... then join the fun. And welcome to the world of Pokemon!

A fun game that lives up to the Pokémon expectation
This game grabbed your attention and doesn’t let go! The kid friendly, fun nature of the game that has come to be expected from the Pokémon brand, with kids of any age looking forward to play the game. Fans of all ages can play Pokémon sword/shield, and different levels of completion can be achieved depending on how you like to play the game.

Ignore the hate, Pokemon Sw/Sh is great
As someone who is a fan of Pokemon, it lived up. Graphics are sure, not impressive but very vibrant and colorful, could use some polish, New Pokemon are unique and the new stuff added will depend if you like it.

Ignore the hate from the fans, it is great.
