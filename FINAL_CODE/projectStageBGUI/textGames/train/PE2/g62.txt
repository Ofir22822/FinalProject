Multiplayer and warzone are amazing for teens
Im 13 and I play with so may of my friends and i can say nothing but praise for this game. the story mode has some things that you might not want you kids to see but if they are mature I think they can handle it.

Good
It’s not bad you can turn off blood and language there’s one scene where you can interrogate a women and a kid but you can skip it. It also has great role models for kids who wanna be in the military to see the great men and women serving our country.

Great Game for tweens and teens if you stay away from the Campaign
This game is an extremely rewarding and enjoyable online experience. The multiplayer is always fun thanks to a variety of operators, weapons and challenges to work towards. The multiplayer aspects of this game are not overly graphic at all. When shot blood spurts and stains surfaces but is not very noticeable. The multiplayer is all action with very few slow moments depending on your play style. However the Campaign is a completely different story. Infinity Wards objective is to make a realistic and brutal story. The missions though they have the same gunplay are much more graphic and realistic with various gore effects. Various missions throughout such as "Clean House" and Farahs flashback missions are graphic and upsetting. All in all the multiplayer I would rate 13+ but the campaign 15+

Multiplayer is 12+ but campaign is 16+
This game's campaign features very gory and disturbing imagery, from shooting screaming, helpless people in agony, to torturing your enemies for information. The campaign for that reason receives a 16+ from me. HOWEVER the multiplayer is fit for anyone aged 12 and up in my opinion. There is swearing ("f*ck", "sh*t") but that can be turned off by turning dialogue off and there can be dismemberment with some weapons, but that can be turned too, meaning players can only see a small cloud of blood. Multiplayer is only 12+ with these off. Hope this helped :)

MY FAVOURITE GAME!!!
This game is incredible but there are also lots of bloody moments like finishing moves. there is swearing but mostly in the campaign. Sometimes there are toxic players you know how it is but honestly it should not be 18+. I started when I was 12 but I never got addicted. It's fun but you need to play multiple game modes to get the best experience

Don’t listen to the Karen’s!
First the reviews on this game are Karen’s that don’t care what real reviewers say in the campaign yes pretty violent But the multiplayer is fine you can barley see the blood and it won’t “Make your kids terroists!” They are exatterateing so if your kid really wants the game just give it.

And if someone swears you can all ways mute them plus most parents writing the reviews haven’t played The game.

From an honest person that want the best for your kids
Well, common sense lied in some parts. The video all happens but you can turn off anything that can actually scar your kid or make them act violent. I’ve played it so I should know.

It’s a good game
I think it should be 11 plus there is blood, guns and a little bit torture and healing injections and it’s basically based on what army personnel go throughout and my dad lets me play it.
You can go into the setting and turn off blood

Great game!
Ok, I know that it says there is sex and really, I've seen no kissing, no in the bed stuff and none of that. It would be fine but pretty violent. That was for campaign, the story part. I recommend doing that so your child doesn't have to spend money on extra characters. It gives you some free. The story has a lot of swearing, but no racial slurs of any kind. Next, the multiplayer mode. You can talk with random people, but you can mute yourself and mute everyone else. If you are in a PS4 or Xbox party, it will usually.only let you talk to party members or friends in the party. Also, forgot 1 thing. In story mode, there is one character that smokes cigars and his name is Captain Price. On to Warzone, the battle royale map in Verdansk, russia . This I'snt as bad as the other modes, as you can do a setting where you don't put random people in your team. You cannot talk with anyone but your team. That's about it

Fine just a little to mature for kids...
This is a fun game with a fun online! However this game has a campaign with Profanity, Gore (Can be filterd), and mature topics... This game has lots of filters you can turn off characters dialogue leaving only subtitles, Mute online players, and turn off the gore. I say for teens mainly due to its heavy theme of the campaign but most things can be filtered.

Great but the campaign was to short
I would’ve given this game a 5 star review if it weren’t for the fact it has and extremely short campaign as I finished it after about 5 hours.
This game main problems are the violence and swearing. The swearing is pretty frequent. Like all call of duty games The violence is pretty bloody and frequent.

Great for a shooter
Being a big fan of story based games I have to say it was pretty good. Violence: almost all of the violence in the game is shooting. Personally I can handle this even with the blood and gore. You can turn off blood in settings but keep in mind it can be turned back on anytime. There is also melee combat but it isn’t very exaggerated or violent with only a simple animation and a tiny bit of blood. Swears: there is frequent swearing throughout the campaign but I don’t recall any in online multiplayer. These include mostly f-bombs and some s##ts. It’s nothing worse than what I hear at school. Campaign: the campaign/story was the selling point for me, I did play some multiplayer but found the story much more intriguing. It was insanely well done for a shooter and there were some good messages of teamwork and doing the right thing. In conclusion, anyone 13 or older should be able to play this game without any problems and I would rate multiplayer a 4/5 and the campaign a solid 5/5.

The review that Common sense media gives it is based of the story made which is much darker so my review is split 18+ for the campaign and 13+ for the pvp aspect
