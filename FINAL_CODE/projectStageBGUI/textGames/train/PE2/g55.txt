Fun solving puzzles and even provided a couple challenges for Daughter and Daddy
I bought this "for me" as a late Christmas gift. I play Mario Kart and Mario Party with my daughter (we'll call her Princess Peach), and Dad needs something fresh. I had seen the gameplay for Luigi's Mansion 3 and noticed you could play it with two players on story mode. I've been playing games my whole life and naturally wanted to get Peach into them. So knowing Peach's level of critical thinking, I thought she might do well to challenge herself and learn a game that didn't drive for her (i.e. mario kart drive assist). Peach will be 5 in July 2020.

Peach has got a pretty good grip on most the controls. You'll be using both thumbs, the left to move Luigi around and the right to aim the Poltergust (vaccuum) or flashlight. She moves around just fine, can open doors and interact with objects. There was a learning curve that I had to walk her through, but it didn't take her long to pick up on it at all. She sometimes struggles with aiming the Poltergust and getting the ghosts (which can get tougher the further up the mansion you go). Still, we were able to beat the entire game, but there were times I had to take on Luigi so we didn't die. I tried to have her use Gooigi who can die and come back to life as many times as you want. One note on Co-Op: You will be unable to play the story on co-op until you get through a "tutorial" portion at the beginning of the game - once you get the poltergust and defeat the bellhop ghost in the garage, you'll have to get a briefcase which gives you access to Gooigi and finally a &lt;5 minute tutorial on how to use him. Then you can turn on Co-Op through the pause menu.

We needed a little help from youtube on some of the bosses/puzzles where I was just missing something to solve. Some of the later bosses were actually kind of tough. But we were able to talk to one another, explore together and solve puzzles together. You're able ot buy gold bones which revive you if Luigi dies, and we were never really at any point where we were in danger of getting the game over screen once they were available for purchase (got to beat few levels first). Mom or Dad don't have to be gaming professionals, but you will be doing most of the ghost encounters on your own until the little one picks up on it (early on, I had to take out 100% of ghosts, but even now, it's 90%/10% at best) and you will have to do most of the directing and prompting to get your 4-6 year old to solve puzzles. You'll also want to consider taking over Luigi on boss fights if your little one is unconcerned for Luigi's well being. But the game starts out easy and gets progressively harder, so you have time to get acquainted with the controls if you are generally new to gaming. But it was great fun and I'm so glad I bought this game. So much so, that Peach has asked that we play through the whole game a second time.

I give this a 5 star because it is the perfect fit for what I was looking for - a game that challenges my daughter to think about how to solve the puzzle at hand, introduce her to the next step in coordinating both thumbs to move and aim concurrently, and it's super fun, silly and cute. It's not going to be that challenging for the experienced gamer, but Dad is happy sincec Peach is always asking me to play it with her and spending time with her is why I Luigi's Mansion 3 in the first place.

Charm Oozes Out of Nintendo's "Horror" series
To get an idea of how charmed I was during my delightful play through all you have to look at is one moment. There is a moment where a ghost nearly drowns Luigi and Luigi is saved by Polterpup. Luigi takes a moment to pet him and tell him how much of a good puppy he is.

Incredible! I love it!
It may be scary, but on my opinion it's not. I think some of it's cheery actually. Luigi is very brave fighting all those ghosts.I love how it can be 2 player when you unlock Gooigi. The hotel owner is a bit scary and I find her voice frightening , but apart from that , it's not scary! I watch YouTube Videos about this to get by levels , but I do most of it on my own. It's hard, but it's easy to play so I'd say it's 6 plus.It's so good , but some of the ghosts are impossible to destroy. It took me months to Destroy the Mozart ghost. Hard , but easy to play.

Fun, but hard!
This game is really fun. Great story, and lots of challenging puzzles. Unfortunately, younger kids who get the game are going to have a hard time. The puzzles are quite challenging, and some of the bosses are near impossible. Also, if you have old controllers, it is hard to change into Gooigi. Even at my age, the final bosses are still near impossible. Even though it is hard, this game is still a treasure. The ghosts are not scary, but certain scenes, and the mansion itself has a spooky atmosphere. Have fun playing!

Very good puzzle game that keeps you going
This game has hardly any scariness you can do puzzles that are challenging,hard bosses,and it can take up to 20 hours to beat maybe more if your child isn’t very good at puzzles.Very creative game better than the Luigi’s mansion game cube!

Luigi's Mansion 3 is a fun, clever, and family friendly game.
In this game, you must save your friends from a haunted hotel. It's really fun, and only has cartoon violence. It has nothing inappropriate in it, and is fun for the whole family.

Spooky fun
Luigi's mansion is a light hearted &amp; funny "horror game". While the game is a direct follow up to the previous entries there not really important besides for some character's and such. There are some occasional jump scares from cartoony green ghosts and the game can be a bit complicated at times but it's still fun. This game adds two player so you can play along side your kid as 'Goo-igi', a luigi made of goo.

A waste of money
I say it’s 18 plus because it’s near impossible to play. Unless you are a wizard. The graphics are gorgeous it’s why I bought the game. But it’s controls are laggy, there are so many enemies and you take almost half a bar with every hit. On top of that you can’t heal. Not easily at least. I’ve played it for 2 hours and made it maybe 3 minutes in the game because it’s impossible not to die.

Surprising bite.
It may seem slow and miserable after its surprisingly fast paced intro which leads you to think this is some sort of hack and slash; but if you give it a chance and stick with it, you will find a game with strong atmosphere, innovative and intuitive role playing/progression mechanics and a story with (mostly) better writing than Life is Strange. Combat isnt super deep or challenging but is one of the more fluid takes on the Souls formula. Theres also a large amount of blood and gore in combat (gushing blood, impaling and exploding foes) and throughout the world with mountains of gross rotting and scorched corpses. Especially in Skal lairs with disemboweled and impaled nude bodies. Moreso if you choose to lead areas into chaos with your choices. Fair amount of F words.

Its a good game
A game about Vampires, there's obviously gonna be blood, but in this game you can sort of pick a side between, coming a good or bad vampire (whether you drink from civilians or not).
Some scenes can be frightening for young kids that's why I wouldn't recommend under 13's to play this game,
