Please don’t get your kids this game.
I’m going to be honest, fishing games have alway bored me. The fun of fishing is the payoff of desperately trying to reel in a catch after tons of waiting. I fish, and I enjoy it. Fishing games rush the process, meaning that the payoff is almost non existent. The game is technically fine for kids, but if your kids want this game I beg that you give them a much more fun alternative. Like staring at a blank wall.

Good looking, but ultimately dull
For a game with such a high asking price, the game is very short on mechanics. The flight controls are complicated and will upset smaller kids, who will quickly get frustrated, and the lack of things to do will bore older kids. The game environment is beautiful, but the animal and character models do very little, and don't react in any way to what you do.

Ultimately this game consists entirely of trying to fly into circles that contain pollen, which can be challenging given the poor controls.

It could be a decent teaching tool, which is why this game is probably good for schools, libraries or maybe your church, but I'd pass on spending money to add this to your personal library.

Annoying controls but great game!
This game is amazing, I really enjoyed it controllers drift off (Your hands in the game.) so it can get frustrating at points. As for violence there is none (you do get in a Dalek and shoot other Daleks but no blood) But for frightening stuff there is tons this game is creepy the first level has green blobs with orange eyes called Hydrocs and they are in washing machines when you get close they will smash the screen. The second level has a dark forest with troll like creatures following you. Level 3 is extremely scary and has 3 jumpscares, creepy voices and big angel statues called the Weeping Angels which you can't look away at and one major jumpscare the rest of the levels are fine after that. They also say Hell and Jesus quite a bit. This game is great and would recommend to any doctor who fan that has a VR kit.

One of the best VR games I’ve ever played!
I’ve just finished playing through the game on PS4 VR, and being a huge Doctor Who fan, it was amazing! You don’t need to have prior knowledge of Doctor Who to play this game which is great for newcomers. It is fun, has a gripping story line and is truly unsettling at some points. I found myself getting scared out of my skin by the weeping angles and scratching my head for ages at the puzzles. Very satisfied overall, but a little short for its price and has nothing truly groundbreaking

Phenomenal game, I recommend this for your child if they want this game
This game is really good! I don’t understand why it is rated M, it should at least be rated T, because mainly in the game you are just walking around delivering packages to multiple destinations in the world. While there are some moments of combat but that rarely happens. This game advises you to not engage in violence. It encourages you to be peaceful. The story in this game is so beautiful, the environment is peaceful, and kids could learn some good messages in this game as well.

Its exists
Mostly peaceful. The only violent and disturbing imagery is in the beginning and end. The gunplay is so bad you wont use it.
Indulgently "artsy" and the story sucks. But the gameplay grew on me after a revisit. It can be fun if you take it easy, plan everything out and manipulate the jank physics to your advantage.

Rated 15 (strong language, threat, violence).
SEX/NUDITY - Some mild verbal sexual references, and moments of natural nudity (mainly buttocks). VIOLENCE/GORE - Moments of moderate violence occur throughout, where the main character must knock out enemies to progress, or where enemies attack the main character, although violence is not the primary focus of the game. There are also scenes of fantasy violence where fantastical creatures attack humans by dragging them under a tar-like liquid or consuming them (these scenes are more scary/intense than violent). PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck") and other milder terms used throughout the game, though not excessively. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Occasional drug references, where the main character is asked to deliver packages which contain "drugs". Although the "drugs" aren't exactly specified for what their uses are, there is brief mention that they make people "happy". There are also occassional scenes of alcohol consumption. THREAT/HORROR - Sequences of strong sustained threat and moderate horror throughout. These involve intense and suspenseful moments where characters are menaced by almost-invisible supernatural beings. There are other moments while traversing through the environment where the main character will encounter strange and disturbing creatures resembling humans emerging from pools of a black tar-like liquid, and they try to drag you down below the surface. These enemies are a primary focus of the game's narrative, and cannot be avoided.

15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.

Incredibly Dissapointing
So the game's main premise is walking, walking walking walking. There are parts where the game is incredibly tedious and can bore the player. The game's visuals and the story is incredible. The visuals make you feel isolated on monster-infested Earth. The story also carries out these amazing visuals with the cutscenes being incredibly intriguing and fun to watch. Overall the game is incredibly boring but the story sometimes makes up for it. I still give it a 2 star because the gameplay makes the game not so great. It would be a little bit better if there were more frequent attacks from the enemies, but even when they do attack the controls feel extremely clunky and janky (same goes with the vehicles).

Really good action game mixes great role models and messages with suspense and stealth.
I personally really like this game. It's about reconnecting people together in a broken country by walking across the terrain, making deliveries to people whilst expanding a network that connects everyone together, called the "chiral network." Let's start off with the fact that the map is huge. Over 10 miles of land you can traverse through, and most of it is either flat terrain or rocky mountains. The game also features snowy mountains. The player, or Sam Porter Bridges (who you play as), also has a BB unit (Bridge Baby), which has a connection to the "other side", so it can spot invisible entities/enemies called BTs (short for Beached Things), enemies that you cannot see but they're still frightening. The game also features other enemies, such as MULEs, other humans that have an obsession with cargo (unfortunate for Sam; that's what he's carrying). These enemies have guns and rifles, however they are often non-lethal and electric. Some missions features sneaking into MULE camps and retrieving cargo from their postboxes. The game features partial nudity, which includes male buttocks. It also contains some gory cutscenes, including characters committing suicide and other gruesome acts. The story is pretty difficult to follow, and is told mostly via cutscenes. The intro to the story might feel very long, since it's just cutscenes and shorter deliveries. There is also the swearing: multiple f-bombs, s-words and other curse words are dropped. However, the role models and messages are great and shows friendship, connection, and if people are playing online, their structures or their avatar might even get likes from other players. In my personal opinion, this game is one of the best ever, and I highly recommend it to anyone 15+.

Great
It’s a great game the soundtrack has a few words in it but no f word only the b word and people do say s and others but that’s it. The cops are intense but other then that it’s fun and if you are new the nfs I played the mobile version of most wanted but new to console so if your new to the console or pc versions of the game it’s a little hard but on the easy mode it’s not to bad. And in the title screen it says to obey the law and where your seatbelt. And lastly the main characters are nice but Not to spoil it but there is protesting in it

Best NFS game in years!!!
Yes, finally it's about time. NFS is back and better than ever!! EA has now returned back to roots with this latest installment in the franchise. The developer Ghost Games did a phenomenal job creating it. They listened to their fans!! Shows that they cared to give us what we wanted and exceeded our expectations. So far so good I'm enjoying it!! Definitely has those nostalgia type of vibes like the Underground era, Most Wanted 2005, Carbon and Pro Street. What a great combination to give us those memories of what we been growing up with all those years!! The customization is on a different level of body kits, paint, rims, etc,. And for once, no more microtransactions!!! Stunning graphics and textures it's so appealing to look at especially if you have a Ultra HD 4K tv. I love the idea you can change the time cycle to Day and Night. Makes it even better and challenging. I love a good challenge,
and it's unique. Awesome soundtrack too!! Along with intense racing and police pursuits!! There is some quite of language but by now, I'm sure all kids grew up with games that having cursing and so it's nothing new to them. Anyone can play it, totally fine with that. Besides it's a racing game, so you can have a blast with this one without worrying what your kids are playing. A little violent but it's sometimes has to deal with hot pursuits and illegal racing. Just as long as your kids don't portray that out in the real world and know it's just a game then go ahead let them play it. Overall, very refreshing and fun game!!! 9.5/10.

Fun, realistic, and they forgot that there is police brutality in one of the last levels where Mercer beats up Luca and holds you and ana at gunpoint to tell him info. Don't do glitches or cheats to get money just get high levels at night and grind during the day and earn easy 200,000 in 30 minutes at RP lvl40,

A really great game with 2 most bad language word and mild violence
This game is really best at awesome for people who loves cars but there’s some violence like crashing into cars and police chases and there’s 2 words in this game that those are bad in real life like S word and D word so l still call it fine for all kinds of teens whatever now.

There are the odd bad words but not very often. The storyline is very interesting and tells a lot about corruption and why it’s not great. You play as a street racer and are getting hunted by the corrupt police force.

The best nfs game I've played in a while
Nfs heat is a great game. The gameplay is awesome and it's very easy to play. The only thing I think that is very odd is that you have to pay 5$ for one car. Other than that the gameplay is great and the swearing shouldn't be a concern as it's just "s-" and "a-".

Need for Speed Heat Review and Age Rating
The NFS franchise really made a comeback with this game! The cops sometimes can be a little clueless, but over all it's a really good game, especially removing the speed cards from Payback. And visual customization is unreal. There are some positive messages after a race. The only violence would be crashing your car, but I don't think it's much violence. Now to the actual Age Rating. The reason why this game is rated teen is because of the language. Language is most present in cut scenes and story missions. Sometimes, the characters talk when you haven't done a race, which can include some language. But really, it's up to the parent, you just have to rely on your kid that he/she knows that swearing is wrong.

Best Need for Speed comeback in years!!!
The NFS games have been falling off lately. But this game is a good return to having a good game in the series. Vehicular violence is moderate. Cops are aggressive and can wreck your car seriously. In dialogue, use of strong language is present. Use of "$h!t" and mild language is heard. Language is infrequent.

Just Dance Your Heart Out
I was so excited, for this was my first sleepover! That was the first time I played Just Dance (Version 4). Once you start, you can’t stop. Not only is the game Just Dance 2020 worth your time, it also has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is a little high, this game is worth every second of your time. Even though the person dancing on the screen is fake, it looks real. The dancing is smooth and clear, and it doesn’t look like it was animated. The background art is exquisite, and it doesn’t glitch or look pixelated. If you like music and dancing, Just Dance 2020’s song and dances are perfect for you. The song selection is huge, over 400 songs! Although the price of Just Dance 2020’s accessibility is high, once you pay for it, you’ll find that it is worth it. If you come home from a sad day at work or at school, Just Dance 2020 will definitely cheer you up. To spend some time playing Just Dance is worth every second of your time, for it has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is high, the game Just Dance is definitely worth your time.

My Just Dance Review
I really like Just Dance! Some of the songs might have "mature lyrics" but it bleeps it out! Also, there is a solution called "Kids Mode" that can help you with that! I love that I can play video games but still be active at the same time! Epic game overall, I highly recommend it!

Parents are overreacting!
Okay, I'd like to point out that the parents are overreacting. I saw some of their reviews, and I think it is partially their fault for not setting boundaries for the songs. Sure, some songs have inappropriate content, sure, it has some moves that parents might not enjoy seeing, but it's their fault for not setting boundaries. And if the kids are 6 or under, they can enjoy kids mode, with totally appropriate content! The curse words are bleeped out, and overall it's a fun experience of exercise and fun all bundled into one! I love this game!

He loves it! We play it as a family a lot and in the UK its rated PEGI 3 so honestly, its not inappropriate. All bad parts are blanked out and these songs are heard on the radio on a daily basis. The naughty parts go over my bros head. If you are mega protective, just play on Kids mode (it has no inappropriate content whatsoever).

Just got the game for Christmas and it's the best Just Dance there is! Great songs, so modern and really easy! They have great new features too. So good! Rude lyrics are bleeped out. No "suggestive" dance moves either if you're fussy.
