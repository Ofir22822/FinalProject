If you've never played 8 before, buy it.
But if you already have an older version, the improvements aren't really worth buying it again. The older Steam version can be modded to an even better state than this somewhat lazy cash grab.

Retro style dungeon crawler has smooth execution and pace. 2 player couch co-op.
Multiple retro "pixel art" games that throw back to the 16 bit era graphically are many times an ugly eye sore, not very compelling, too simple and repative or all of the above. Seemingly an excuse to make a cheap game with a low budget with the glaring problems. NOT SO HERE.
If anyone remembers the Prince of Persia on PC, it was pixelated, but with realistic motion and engaging gameplay. Mix that with a classic Dungeons And Dragons theme with a literal storybook narrative and you have this.
At first the learning curve seems a bit steep, but the mechanics of the gameplay show you the ropes little by little and you catch on a a bit more with each try. So you never hit a wall you can't level up past or accomplish so you don't beat your head against the wall. There CAN be a grind to get your character leveled, but each stab at any particular dungeon is randomly generated, and not in a cheap way, so that each run feels different with new challenges and puzzles to uncover. I never realized this until the third time and it makes each try more compelling instead of repetative and annoying. Within a few hours I unlocked several new abilities and became familiar enough that I was plowing through enemies "like a boss" where I had once felt intimidated.
You can unlock new missions and characters by yourself or with local co-op, meaning you are not limited to 'online only' players and can just sit with a friend on the same console with an extra controller (very rare any more). No lie though, the buttons and what they do for trinkets, abilities and so forth take some time to get aquainted, but the game runs so smooth and the combat is deep enough that you'll WANT to take a few moments to get to know your layout, which is also customizable to change the buttons and what they do if you so desire.
I have NEVER recommended a pixel art game before and have not recommended a true local co-op game of this ilk since Castle Crashers. Honestly, the game is downright beautiful at times and superbly animated. But if any of the above sounds compelling, look into this one for sure because I think it's a rare find, and to get my wife to drop her slow paced puzzle phone game to play an action RPG is almost impossible. Seriously.... I just may have to grind out her character a bit, but I'm fine with that. This is truly an 'easy to pick up' game that has depth if you want it.
This game reminds me of the best Fantasy movie elements of the 80s and 90s movies, LOTR, Prince of Persia, Gauntlet and much of the best things of each rolled into one place. I'm loving it in so many ways. Only reason it's not a 5 star review is that this game does NOT have a difficulty setting and may be too frustrating for kids making this a take it or leave it scenario for entry and the boss fights can be often ABRUPT difficulty spikes making you have to retread dungeons again, even if they are different with each run through.

This is a really good game! I do think its a bit over priced at 60 bucks, but the content is mostly clean. The closest you get to anything sexual is a girl who has short shorts. There are a few occurences where a curse word is said, but not much of it. It's a difficult game, so if you're looking for something that'll be a breeze, this isn't a game for you. The only violence is animated fights where guns, blades, and more can be used.

A police action-adventure game, but contains some emotional material
This game is actually pretty good! I haven't seen any other action games where you take control of a police officer and stop crimes and other materials. Apparently you mostly fight these aliens called the Chimeras and sometimes criminals. Here's a tip for the stealth sections, you can control your Legion to bind enemies so you don't have to walk up to them from behind. Here's one intense part; the most intense part for some parents is when one of the main characters (Max Howard, the dad of the main character) dies early on in the game and where all of the weapons nicknamed the Legion turn on them. In fact, you don't get Max's Legion until File 08. There's a reference to drugs of mass destruction and some profanity, but someone who's like me, I can handle drugs and profanity because it isn't gross-inducing to me, but not realistic gore. Bayonetta and most M-rated action games have blood/gore but at least its unrealistic looking. There are puzzles which require a lot of brainpower, other puzzles have a "look before you leap" type situation, and then there are situations which are easy to mess up on, especially the parts where you need the Beast Legion to cross falling platforms.

Amazing game with a deep story
This game does touch on subjects that could make some people think twice, but I assure you that this game does not go to deep into anything bad and treats all of the subjects it covers seriously. I played this game when I was thirteen and had no problems with anything. This game has no blood and has a variety of difficulties for younger audiences. A mature 9 or 10 year old could definitely enjoy this game, but an average 11 year old would love it.

Man of Medan: FUN!
I played this with my younger son Jimson,

We had a blast! We passed the controller along and played together flawlessly, The language can be avoided easily and is quite light-hearted often making us laugh while the joke goes over the kids head, The blood is limited and scares are limited to creepy faces which turn out to be fake, This is a ghostly story that anyone mature can handle, If your son can handle the Arkham and spiderman games, They can handle this. I would recommend this to non- tech-savvy adults as well as children, I was worried about violence and swearing, but l ended up having my first gaming experience with my child, I would recommend this to everybody. The characters are funny, good role models and always give you the option to apologize and the game always puts the emphasis on saving your friends, Making it a must to be altruistic to your family members.

Good Graphics,Bad Game
Until Dawn wasn’t the greatest game but it did have good characters,good actors and a some what good story to it. This game has none of that! It’s characters are dry and boring just like the story. The story doesn’t make any sense and is just plane random from the start. Don’t waste your money,just watch a YouTuber play it.

Great as long as your kid is mature
This game, man of medan, is great. Even though there is some blood, there is not much gore. There is some language, but it's no worse than fallout or call of duty. If your child is mature, than it shouldn't be a problem.

Spooky fun for movie night with friends.
Entertaining, but loses appeal Solo (2 stars if so) due to less individual choice and consequence. The deaths (max 9 per playthru; not including NPCs) are not nearly as gory as Until Dawn but can get a bit bloody. Such as rats eating a body (though the rats haven't dug too deep yet), an offscreen throat cut with blood splatter, and a man slamming his head resulting in a large bloody pool. Others are bloodless like drowning and neck snapping. There are technically 69 total death scenes. But most are duplicates in slightly different contexts. Speaking of which, many depend less on choice and more on QTEs which is a bit disappointing. Fairly frequent language.

It’s not as bad as you think it’s got a tiny bit of violence and language and that’s about it
Yes it has a tiny bit of violent but coming from someone who isn’t a horror expert I find it not scary whatsoever . There is no reason your kid shouldn’t play this game . To be clearly honest it has a tiny bit of language but it isn’t extreme. In addition to that at middle school everyone is swearing so it’s no different to when they are at school.

Disappointing
I do to want to spoil anything, but the story leaves much to be desired, and answered. It has a depressing storyline, that doesn't make sense, and leaves you with a bad feeling. I am OK with depressing stories, but it has to make sense, and having a reason for being the way it is

Deeply Intense, Scary
BLAIR WITCH is an easy gameplay with plenty of foul language. Parents should be cautious about the tension and scariness.
