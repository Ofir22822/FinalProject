Great Game!
I know it's rated T for Teen, but really, it's not that bad. There's barely any blood and you can only see it if you are really close. No gore. Sometimes there is some language, but it's not strong (it's the D-A word if you were wondering), as long as your kid is mature, I think you should get it for them. Oh, and I forgot to tell you that one character smokes, and another character you can see the side of their breasts.

Amazing, but don't play competitively if you're young :/
I've been playing Overwatch since it first released. I got the origins edition, and the full game on pc to show my support. Many things are great about this game, for example, once you pay for the game, you don't have to pay for anything else after unless you want to. Every review I've seen so far just addresses the wonderland full of battles and characters, but one thing I love about the game is the strategy. It forces you to play to your team's strengths and weaknesses, and it forces you to do what you have to do if you want to win. There are many team roles in this game, and many seem to ignore it, but it's a huge part of this game. It teaches many that if you don't have a good person filling that niche, it can easily fall apart without coordination. You don't even need aim to play this game at all, in fact, you can play several other heroes that can help you as a crutch and STILL be useful. There's high skill ceilings and floors for many heroes, and it will take awhile to master many of them. The major part of this is that in order to really experience the game at the height of what it is, is to play as much as you can. The game constantly puts out new events and releases fresh content that anyone would love. On the topic of the characters, they're great in design and backstory. Every character has something that many can identify with, and will have a great time playing as in the world of Overwatch. I'm a teen, and I play a lot of competitive Overwatch. I wouldn't recommend slapping your 8 year old child into a game who thinks he runs the town by playing a shoddy sniper. It ruins the experience for everyone. Do the community a favor and mature before you play the game.

Overwatch is more kid friendlier than the rest of the First person shooter games.
Just because there are no explicit swearing heard usually,and the characters are drawn in a Pixar art style and have awesome futuristic weapons which are designed to not be too violent for a standard first person shooter game.And also there is no blood or visible gore in this game just like they have no sex or sexual themes.There are positive role models,but the most clear as crystal moments are for Tracer,Winston,Mei and some heroes you may refer to as role models such as Mercy.
And also if there is the chat mode turned on...the game will be far from kid friendly because of vulgar and insulting comments that sound like the ones you heard from cyberbullying.

No drugs or sex at all!
There was no sex nor sexual references at all throughout the game with no drugs whatsoever unless you include one character who smokes. Otherwise it is a great game which anyone can enjoy, kids and parents alike. However, some of the language people use on the chats can be rude and sometimes mean, I usually only play with friends or AI.

Non-Realistic Violence, and No Inappropriate Scenes.
I have played this game for a while, and you learn that teamwork is the best strategy for winning. The deaths are nothing like games such as Call of Duty, the graphic violence isn't visible, just a health bar dropping. Role models are positive, because it teaches you to stand up against bullies. The storyline mainly has to do with a robot war, and you are there to keep peace with robots. Anyone would easily be fine with it. McCree, the cowboy sort of character, smokes, but not many people use him. I recommend this for 8+ if your child is mature. Trust me it is completely fine.

No
The fact that they gave it a 2 in sex is offensive. There is nothing like that at all. The worse that there are girls in skin tight pants but that's it. There is basically no drugs at all except someone who is smoking and that is not very apparent.

Just like lego games.
Overwatch is like any lego game. You eliminate the enemy team in order to complete the objective. The only difference with overwatch is there are more guns and more details to the guns.

Great
Very good. Violence is quite limited, but cartoonish. Comp scene is very good, but queuing leaves some to be desired. Tons of bad team comps, but w/ friends it's fine. Very physically and ethnically diverse with characters from: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany,Russia,Sweden,US,UK,Brazil,UAE,Egypt,Mexico,and more to come. Also has a gay character.

Great game, not bad.
Great game. there isn't ANY nudity or drugs. The only thing with drugs is a guy in the game that smokes a cigaret. Also the game is multiplayer, and there is a chat. If you don't want your kid hearing anything bad, simply turn off the Voice chat in settings. It is a hard game, and can sometimes be frustrating. The violence is very cartoony, so you shouldn't be worried about it. As long as your kid doesn't rage at other games and things like that, he/she should be fine with the game.

Overwatch is amazing!!!
Overwatch's age rating is too high. There is mild blood but not much else. The blood id barely noticeable and I didn't realize there was blood at all until I was playing for about 5 MONTHS. Great game over all though.

Great game, not too gory.
I have seen many people play Overwatch, and from what I've seen, there is almost no gore and is very fun. The only thing that I could see that's wrong with it is the social interaction element. Players can chat, in a message or talk, and can play with strangers. Other then that, if your kids can play responsibly, I think it should be fine for anyone 10 or over.

Not bad
lets see the good of the game before we see the bad...It helps children co-operate with teammates.Next bad stuff in this game Is hard to find.There is blood but you don't notice,There is a Hero that smokes a cigar a lot of the time.Some heros have reaveling costumes but That dosn't matter
the first thing is online chat.But this can be avoided by not joining
parties.
I play this on my youtube channel and it's child friendly enough.

Very hard, but not much violence
Just because there is guns doesn't mean that it is violent and bloody. No blood and it more like lasers that you shoot. Young kids might not like it because of how hard it is.

Common Sense Rant.
Ok, so... this game is actually more 10 and up. 1st, McCree is smoking a cigar, not a joint. a tip in the chat problem, if you are playing ps4 or xbox one, hop into a party. at least i think. on ps4, prioritise party chat audio. on xbox, idk I'm a ps4 gamer.

Best game ever, great for kids
This game is definitely good for kids!!! My dad is very cautious about the video games that I play, but still decided to purchase the game for me. I got it when I was 12 years old, and I'm now 13. He has watched me play before and thinks it's great. I will admit it VERY OCCASIONALLY uses the word damnit when a character is upset, but it doesn't matter because a lot of parents don't understand that kids here worst stuff at school all of the time. It has a great message that the world could always use more heroes and you should show your kids some animated short which bring a great message. The character Mccree smokes a cigar but that is just because he is a classic western cowboy. Violence is fine for kids if all ages. In fact, my cousins, (4 and 6) have played the game before. It is a colorful kid friendly game and is the only game I've played in months!!! FAVORITE GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be aware some female characters may show some boob and butt.

It gets a 10+ by me.
It is not a bad game there is blood BUT as hard as I try to see it, it's still really hard to notice.
I would say this game is one of the best games ever and it is VERY beginner friendly so if you are thinking of getting a first person shooter I would highly recommend this.
The consumerism is up for this one because there is a lot of clothes and such you can get but everything there is worth buying 100 times because it is such high quality.
The worst thing probably in this game is one character (McCree) has a cigarette but it is VERY hard to notice during gamepley and you only really notice it during close ups which happen for at max 5 seconds at a time but if you are going to stop your daughter/son over this statement think again because so many people in the world smoke so your daughter/son will probably just see it in-game then not care because they know smoking is bad.

Really fun
Overwatch is a 6v6 first person shooter(FPS.) As most FPSs are they can be violent. But overwatch isn't. The game has 23 characters. There is one character that is smoking. Mcree, but as a cowboy that is usuall. Some of the female characters are kind of "revealing" by there out fits.

Fine for kids
I've played Overwatch for about a month and it's a very fun game. This game is fine for kids because there is such little blood that you have to have a magnifying glass to see it. This game has a wide variety of characters to choose from and it only take minutes to learn how to use them. I will admit that some of the female characters do have slightly revealing outfits, but you could just as likely find a random woman walking down the street with a similar outfit. I'm just going to recap Blood:No, Gore:No, Violence:Characters falling to the ground, Sex:Slightly revealing outfits, Swearing:Minimal, Drug/Drinking:A cigar

Best game I've ever played
This game is amazing and I'm basically addicted. But honestly, Mccree smoking a cigar is not considered drugs. Yeah, some female characters may be a little underdressed (I mean like very little) but that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is teamwork to push a cart (Payload) to an objective or to take control of a point (Hardpoint if you've played Call of Duty).

Overall, this game was actually made for kids and so many other people love it. When CSM says that there is blood when I have never seen blood yet.

Overwatch
Overwatch is a colourful futuristic first person shooter. There are twenty-one heros to choose from and customise. They are all unique individuals, and whilst there are different character roles every character feels different. Widowmaker's outfit does not cover up the whole of her upper body, but nothing over sexual is shown. I only occasionally encountered blood (usually when shooting at very close range) and there wasn't much of it. I'd say that this game is fine for age eight and up, but that would only be for watching an older sibling play it.

Highly overrated shooter.
Way too highly overrated. Sure, the graphics are ok, but gameplay, not so much. No story, all multiplayer, which sucks. The gameplay is way to frenetic, makes no sense, and makes you think, what the heck is going on! In the end, it feels like your playing something out of the Disney Infinity. Go play Destiny if you want a rated T shooter.

Overwatch is an FPS for kids.
Listen, there are lots of gory first person shooters out there, but Overwatch is basically the opposite. It's an amazing game, and it's good for kids. There are general messages of doing the right thing. In fact, one of the character's signature messages is "The world is worth fighting for!" The review here gave a couple of minor bumps, such as McCree who smokes a cigar (https://goo.gl/images/eTlS88) which I honestly think is really not that big a deal. I mean, he's basically a cowboy. What do you expect? Also, they commented about the design of the character Widowmaker (https://goo.gl/images/r3nfK7) and how it could be seen as "sexual" but, basically, it only is if you want it to be. So, if you don't (as you probably don't); whatever. It's fine. They also mentioned voicechat and the simple text chat and how you could be exposed to profanity, etc. But, if you simply go into the settings for these things while in a game by pressing P, you can configure it so you don't hear voicechat and, in extreme measures, not see text chat. Of course, text chat is basically necessary when people pick more than one of the same character, because, for example, some characters (well, 2) can make turrets, so if you're defending a control point, you can ask them to make turrets around it, so that it's more difficult for enemies to attack.

Overall, Overwatch is an amazing game, and is child friendly, which is a pretty rare mix. Normally it's either meant for teens and adults, and it's good, or it's good for kids, but it's bad. But, Overwatch is a wonderful mix of the two that I play whenever I have spare time.

This is great...
Great game and awesome multiplayer.But,this does have things that you might be concerned about.Well,to start,the only cusses they say are d*mn and h*ll.Second,if you look on the back of the cover,you'll see Use of tobacco.The only tobacco is a character called McCree smoking a cigar.And the blood is only cartoon.The last thing ESRP didn't rate,probably because most people don't notice it,is McCree's belt,which says BAMF.Now,you probably don't know what that stands for but it's bad.Bad A*s Mother Fu**er.It's hard to see and most children don't understand it.If they do I suggest saying that it's BAMF as in if someone gets punched in a Batman comic book.Other than that it's great fun.Hope this helped!!!!

Amazing game, but don't bother if you have an older computer
I LOVE Overwatch. I researched the lore when it first became available, I watched gameplay, I was so excited. When it came out, I was disappointed that my computer wouldn't run it(I have a several-year-old laptop that honestly isn't the best) but expected it. Fast forward to November and the free weekend. I played it and it, honestly, was pretty great. My favorite hero was Lucio because he seems like a character out of Jet Set Radio, one of my favorite games. This game does have unmoderated voice and text chat, but I only had one toxic experience in the probably 20-30 games I played. The characters are pretty good role models(They always protect the innocent, work towards peace, etc) and have diverse backgrounds, such as Lucio coming from Mexico, Pharah coming from Egypt, Reinhardt coming from Germany, and Genji and Hanzo coming from Japan. Heck, you can even play as a robotic monk! It's an amazing game. My only hope is that I get an Xbox One/PS4/can build a better computer so I can actually play this like it was meant to be played.

Very fun and diverse game.
The game is very fun, barely any swearing (occasionally someone says damn.), all the characters are very diverse, many different races, and one character is gay. All the characters are from many different backgrounds. Chinese, Indian, white, black, and some are even robots!

Great Game!
Okay so this game is great, It's probably without a doubt my favorite game. Something I see in the reviews is "revealing clothing on characters" Do you realize that you would see even less clothes on a real person, not a fake character, if you took your child to the beach. Honestly, have you ever heard of a bikini? The only curse word in the game is d*mn, and honestly I don't even class that as a curse word. The only smoking in this game comes from the cowboy character, and honestly what cowboy movie or game doesn't have a cigar? The game is very easy to play. It has a lot of positive role models and not every character is a straight white male. The character on the front of the game is a lesbian for goodness sakes and we have several characters of different religions and cultures. I also see the need to mention that it does not attempt to impose any religion on the player. As for consumerism, the only things you can buy are cosmetics, not a single thing that actually changes the gameplay can be purchased.

great role models for teens struggling with their identity.
the main character/hero is called tracer, tracer is a lesbian. she is on the front cover. how amazing is that? this game is multicultural, cheap in price, constantly updated and monitored and all profanities are blurred out. great game 10/10.
PS. it won game of the year.
