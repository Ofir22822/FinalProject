Ages 14+
This game gives a realistic overview of the horrors of war with a touching story. The campaign itself is the main reason I am giving it a 14+ due to the storyline of terrorist attacks and youngsters not being able to understand the reality of what is actually going on. Otherwise the multiplayer is 13+ and is just like any other first person shooter with the option to turn of gore.

Good game
I think people are crazy when they say the game is for people 18+ the campaign can be a bit brutal but other then that all of the other game modes are fine and you can turn off blood and the language so it is the right maturity of any regular 11+ person

Only Reliable Review Probably
I want to put a reliable review out here from a kid to any parents that wants to get this game for their child. This game is designed to portray modern warfare, hence the title. The campaign is extremely violent, and portrays terrorist attacks and unarmed civilians getting gunned down and blown up. There’s also a scene with a house where you can shoot unarmed people and a infant in a crib if you chose too. I’d say 14 AT LEAST for the campaign. All the kids are on here saying 10 and up are just trying to convince their parents by writing fake reviews. I would’ve done the same. But now that I’m more grown up I understand and respect my parents decisions. It’s extremely dark and violent and deserves the 18 rating. Multiplayer isn’t as bad and only has moderate bloodshed and gore. But there it’s still there. Chances are if you get your kid this game though, they’re going to want to play the campaign, and telling them to not play it’s just going to make them want to play it more. Honestly just hold off and don’t let your kid get it until they’re 14+ if I were you. But I’m not and this might not stop you, but at least you’ll have a reliable review.

common sense needs a bit more common sense
I thinks that this is a spectacular game with obvious swearing (its CoD) However if common sense media is going to say that there are NO positive models in this game then I dont know of any game that has positive models in it.

I have played multiplayer & campaign. And this game is NOT 17+
Although the campaign is on “sensitive subjects” it’s no worse than the gruesome history of our historical life if not our history is a lot worse! The campaign I would rate for 14+ But multi-player 12+. If you are in middle school this is a liable game, and could even be educational.

Mutiplayer is 13+ but Campaign is 15+
Let me start the review off by saying, half of the reviews are wrong, this game is not sutibale for children under 10. At all. The mutiplayer is your standard "gun's blazing" frantic action, its bloody, punch and brutal but if your child is mature and understands the reality of war, do what you think is best.
The campaign on the other hand is a grim portrayal of the true horrors of war. One mission has you playing as a young girl trying to escape after a bombing/gas attack of her home, you are forced to kill a soldier and leave your house as troops murder dying people, children under the age of 15 that are not mature will be desensitised to the level of brutality in war.. Some characters are role models in situations that feel real and are concerned about the consequences of their actions (or lack of). Great campaign though.

Great Game
This game is great. I think the Multiplayer and Special Ops game modes are good for 11+ and the Campaign for 15+.

Very well done game!
This game has a really good campaign, the only issue is that its a short campaign. Multiplayer is fun until you get matched with Campers or Sweats. Warzone is fun and much better than any other Battle Royale games on the Market at the moment. Spec Ops ain't any good, every enemy is on the hardest difficulty possible and there ain't any way to change the difficulty. This game does have Micro Transactions in it though, but you don't have to pay to get anything in the game, it's only Weapon Skins, Character Skins, Battle Passes (One time purchase until the season ends.), and that's pretty much it.

Very fun game
The game gives you lots to do in the multiplayer such as grinding for attachments and new guns. The campaign is not for kids and at times can be very bad for kids, there's one part where you are able to see people hanging and a hostage with a bomb attached. Warzone is fine for kids but there is proximity chat, you can turn that off though (I think)
How old you should be to play the campaign: 13 - 14 years old
Multiplayer: 11 - 13
Warzone: 10 - 12
(that's my opinion and the multiplayer isn't very violent, there is some blood but you can turn that off and it's nothing like the campaign, warzone is just your normal battle royale with some swearing. Blood and swearing can be turned off I believe so that isn't a big deal, campaign is a big no no for kids though and also sorry if I have bad grammar, I am not very good at english)

Overall a Solid Game
Modern Warfare(2019) is a great addition to the Call of Duty Franchise. The Game is not gory compared to other games in the series. The game however includes images of people being gassed, and has some depressing backstory images(hanging, etc). The one scene that is the worst is where you have to interrogate a terrorist and use his family as leverage/hostages. Besides this it is a game certainly worth playing.

A brilliant place to start for casual, or new gamers.
note: I played the campaign all the through just last night, so this is still fresh in my mind. the campaign was gritty, and death was commonplace. this doesn't mean much, as death is common in even games like minecraft. it all depends on how it's delivered. there is blood, which you can turn off. there is dismemberment, which you can turn off. this game paints a picture of a secret war, and is sure to show it's evils. there are hostage situations mid-level in some parts of the game, and depending on how quick the player acts, you can save them. as far as I can tell, there are only about 7 civilian deaths in the entire game, all without blood. this game has mature themes, don't give it to your 8-year-old, but this is a good game to ease people in from either more "Kiddie" games (again, like minecraft) or more peaceful, relaxed games, like animal crossing. in summary, this is a good game, made great by the fact that you can turn down the mature parts of it, to make it a little less heavy-handed. I'd say 13-year-olds could absolutely handle this. hell, I did!

Blood knives and guns!
This game has many different modes so you have to know what you're getting in to!. Let's start off with the campaign mode which in a nutshell is pretty much just a playable story (for anyone who doesn't know what a campaign is). Ya, it's gory and violent and should be left for 17+. I'm not going to get into the contents of the campaign but let's Just say it's mature. BUT co-op and multiplayer should be just fine If your kid knows to write and wrong. However, thair is dismemberment but it can be turned off in the settings. As for language as well. When you kill someone they scream and realistically fall to the ground. You do have the option to turn this off by putting the dialogue volume to zero. Overall I don't think that it should be a problem for a 12-year-old to play multiplayer.

Great mechanics and gameplay but the most disturbing stuff isn't the gore.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a solid CoD, the best in many years. Typically CoD is gory, disturbing and brutally portrays war in an unforgiving way. This CoD is the most disturbing and makes No Russian from mw2 look like child's play compared to this. People burn alive, people are tortured and hung. You can kill civilians in front of their kids and there's a scene where you torture a guy and use his family as leverage. There are several scenes of dead children and executions via hanging or shooting. In terms of gore it's like every other recent CoD. Guns cause blood to realistically splatter on walls and floors, explosives and snipers can dismember people and even decapitate them. You can perform Mortal Kombat esque finishing moves where you slit enemies throats, snap necks and other ways of killing enemies. These clearly glamorise violence but they're optional, as is the gore. Dismemberment can be disabled. The game doesn't glamorise violence much however. It makes you feel bad for killing people in the campaign and portrays war as realistic as possible. It's a gritty, immersive game and is very fun overall. The multiplayer is a good mp. Lots of new innovative ideas and returing ones like vehicles are present and makes the game more realistic and gives these battles scale. Graphically it's gorgeous and is the best looking CoD yet. The guns feel and sound very authentic and realistic as does everything else. The killstreaks are the best yet. You can fly around in a helicopter, control a missile in first person and man a heavy turret and that's only a few. The customisation options are plentiful and it's easy to spend hours tuning your classes. Some maps feel a bit lacking but most are good. Spec ops is ok, not amazing but ok. Warzone is a great ideas and plays amazingly. It's free as well so if you're not sure about this game then try that first and decide for yourself. The campaign is amazing but isn't very long. Overall Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a good entry and has revitalised the franchise. This game is suitable for all 14+ or people with the maturity of a 14 year old.
