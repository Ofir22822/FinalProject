Okkkkkkkk?
This is Ok I guess,
Supper star KO: This is pretty fun a little bare and gets old but a lot of room for improvement overall and pretty new,fun,and cool mode.
Face of Franchise: This is just horrible in so many ways there is no real choices or story and no mater what you pick you get the same story, once you get to the NFL it just turns into regular franchise mode and you only get to play 1-2 games in college and they are way too easy.
Franchise Mode: This is Ok but really is not, there is no motivation or new things that happen so just not motivating
Ultimate Team: This is very fun and never really gets old, the only problem is that EA is really just wants your money so baddly.
The graphics are ok.

Terrible game but its appropriate for most kids
This is a very bad game. Madden for the last few years has been an absolutely horrible game. The game is fine for all ages though. Unless your a sensitive Karen who hates football and thinks its too violent. The only thing you need to make sure is that your credit card is not saved in their Xbox or PS4. Madden has this thing called Ultimate Team where you build up your team with virtual cards that you get from packs which you open with MUT coins. you get MUT coins either by earning them or buying them. If your card is saved they could spend hundreds of dollars. It's a terrible game but it would probably be fun for younger kids. Its just really not for people who want a REAL football experience

This game is age appropriate for the majority of children including younger ones. This does not, however, change the fact that this game is the worst madden ever to come out. The game is buggy, graphically disappointing, and all around worse than any game your child has every played. If they want the game there is nothing wrong with it, per say, but I will warn you that once they have it chances are they won’t want it for much longer.

Come On, it's Madden
I don't understand why some people are saying it's too bad for younger kids. It's just a fun video game. It's not a shooting game, there's not much violence, and most of the modes are easy and fun. There are a few factors that require some understanding of football and the game itself, but it's not that hard. The story mode is very creative and unique, too, and you would think that would really be the only part of the game that is getting these bad reviews, right? Well, yes, but no. This is the main reason people are saying it's not for younger kids, but it's not bad at all! It's actually a very heartwarming story. However, there are some modes that require online play, and once you play someone else and they know your username, they can message you if you're on the same console, and I've gotten some weird stuff from people that I've played online because Madden displays your username when you play online head to head games. And for one of the online modes, Ultimate Team, there are sales, prices, and more sales everywhere! This mode constantly reminds you to spend money on the game, and this is the fastest way to get the best players on your team in this mode. So, your kids may be tempted to buy things on this mode. Also, lots of the songs on the Madden 20 soundtrack include language, but it's pretty discreet. But, it's an overall fun and safe game. So, yeah. Check out Madden 20. It's great!!

Pretty difficult football game with mild language
The thing that would hold me back the most on buying it is the difficulty. I’m 11 and actually a good video gamer. It’s often difficult for me to play because of the skill level it requires to actually get things done on your account. About language, it’s very mild. Background songs mildly include he*l and da*n. But it will blow over. There is an option to take out the music by pushing R3 and going over to the music icon. There’s a option called QB1 where you start as a college QB and work your way to the nfl and it’s cool. Would recommend.

I gave it an 8 and up because really it all depends on your skill set. Although, if they are really young, turn off chat mixer online because if you're that young and playing online you must have some skills so some people may be cussing you out or just words that little kids don't need to hear.

Madden 20
This game is really fun for NFL fans. It lets you play as your favorite team and simulate real football games. There is even a mode called QB1 where you are a college quarterback being drafted into the NFL. The game poses a challenge depending on what skill level you are playing. There is some mild language in the music but it is otherwise a great and very fun game!

Fun
This is one of my favorite games of all time when I started playing madden 5 years ago and I got sucked in. It is addicted but includes no violence that kids haven’t seen or know about. Although it promotes many teams in companies I don’t consider that to be bad.

Engaging football game with lots of opportunities for family fun
This newest release of Madden is fantastic in so many ways. If you have been a fan of the previous Madden games, this one will not disappoint. The controls and gameplay are very similar - new players have the opportunity to learn basic skills in a practice mode, and an optional run-through of the Pro Bowl when you first start up the game helps introduce players to the mechanics. You can play as your favorite team and run through a typical football season, having the opportunity to take your teams to the playoffs and even the Super Bowl. This is also a multiplayer game, so this game is great for family game nights or parties. There is also an option to create a player and edit the team's uniform, so you can customize your own jerseys or even add yourself into the game. The violence in the game is realistic to football; hits and realistic injuries such as sprains or breaks. Many advertisements to buy players for the Ultimate Team franchise. Overall, a fantastic game for both the young and the old.

This was boring as hell
Pretty shovelware. Playing a Mech-dog doesnt come close to fully armed boots on ground action. Every level is the same boring euro city block or boring interior. Enemy and weapon variety is hardly existant and there are almost no gory kills. Not even the primary flamethrower causes any burn damage. The hacker interludes are boring palete cleansers for an already bland main course. Stick to Doom VFR which has way more of everything.

What a waste.
Awful progression with unnecessary RPG elements that severely dampen the gunplay, bad and boring level design, poor netcode, Bethesda's signature buggyness, and top it off with the most obnoxious and unlikable characters in a video game since Duke Nukem Forever. The only good thing is the introduction of a multiverse which gives hope of another reboot that could fix the catastrophe this series has become. Super gory as usual.

Not As Bad
Idk why they said 18 plus personally I think it should be 10 plus if you’re mature enough and don’t repeat what’s in the game
