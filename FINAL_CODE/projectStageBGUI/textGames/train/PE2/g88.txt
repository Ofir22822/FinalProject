Low Effort Money Grubbing Trash.
Its shocking that after all the goodwill Ubi built with Seige, Wildlands, and Division 2 they excrete this! Embarassing AI, non existant immersion, bugs out the wazoo, empty world with the dumbest copy paste content imaginable, a non stop parade of dumb gimmicks including "survival mechanics" that do not fit the action oriented game design copy pasted from Wildlands (you need to wait and refill stamina to CLIMB 2 FEET). I liked Wildlands but even that was no master class; but this trash makes that game look like Witcher 3. Top it off with idiotic psuedo RPG mechanics that serve no purpose but to monetize the hell out of the game and further break the "tAcTiCaL" illusion with bullet sponge drones that add nothing to level design.

Good game for mature teens
As a father of a 11 and 14 year old children at first I was uncertain to buy them their first MA-15+ game. My wife and I had a chat about it and we decided I should play it first. I instantly got drawn into the enjoyable multiplayer. I do believe that it is appropriate for my children. Now your child would be exposed to gun violence, but no consumption of illegal products, in other games like call of duty. Similarly it has little too no swearing and only one character swears. It promotes There is blood but your child has most likely seen it in a movie or TV show. There some people on voice chat can be harsh and rude but that feature can be turned off. As long as you child know the rights and wrongs they should be fine.

They say “God-d*mn” in the first couple of minutes
I really love the gameplay and multiplayer open world action of Ubisoft games, but it seems like the feel the need to use God’s name in vein in every game nowadays - why? Would the game be less appealing if they did’t say “GD” so much? I just got FarCry 5 and they said it in the first couple of minutes and then throughout the game - same thing with Ghost Recon Breakpoint, they said it immediately in the first few minutes and then throughout the game. Also with Ghost Recon Wildlands (which to me was the best game of all time) by why does it make the game any better to say GD all the time - makes me cringe every time and for anyone who has had their lives changed and saved by God, I would think they would feel the same way. I seriously think I have to stop supporting Ubisoft for this reason, their games are good, but my God is great!!

Not as bad as people make it out to be
This game is okay for 10+ because the only real reason it should be higher is the bad language, but you can turn that off in the settings. The only other thing is the violence which certainly isn't as bad as other games where blood and organs explode from a person when they die. The only real point where the violence can be a bit extreme is where players have an option to stab an enemy multiple times in the back - even after they have clearly died - or snapping their neck. I have watched my 11 year old son play this and it's honestly not as bad as alot of the reviews say, most games are okay for kids once they have reached 11 or 12.

This is a good game in my opinion from graphics to weapons , the story line everything a few ideas i have though would be that
1 this game definitely should develop cross play on all platforms of gaming I mean I know that nowadays a lot of games have crossplay but I have other friends that have the game but different systems really think it would put this game at the top next too fortnight, gta, C.O.D etc

Worst in series
I have only played the last three games in the series and this one was the worst by far. Like lots of new Ubisoft titles, they are drifting away from good games to profitable games. The "survival" is a lie, it is the same as most modern FPSs, the newly implements gear level system (similar to that of Destiny) is bad, it is nothing like any other ghost recon game(for the ghost recon series, originality in the story is good but gameplay is best left as is from previous games.) Don't waste your money in this just get Wildlands. As for parental stuff, lots killing, medium amounts of blood, lots of swearing, but encourages team work and helping those that can't help themselves

Amusing
Ironically, after the five star "expert review", Breakpoint falls so short of expectations, you shouldn't even bother with it.

Forget the violence, you'll just be wasting your money.

Good Game
In this game you are a Soldier and you are going to stop terrorists. It’s violent, but most of the game you are not shooting people, you are shooting robots.

Meh
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint takes away the fun that was in Wildlands. If you prefer a solo gameplay then don’t get this game, because it is nearly impossible to complete any tasks outside of story missions.

Bad game
The camera angle in the game is absolutely atrocious. The sense of the game's theme is just bad. Too many glitches in the game and it takes way to long to travel from one place to another.

For parents who are considered getting the game for a child.
The game has a lot of violence cause it uses guns. The story is completely fine. It has a few no no words but nothing racist and no slurs, no sex, nudity, or drug use. It has a lot of blood but no gore like insides coming out. The game is fun and I recommend it to children. Don’t let them talk to strangers cause they say sum pretty bad stuff. Fun with friends. Let someone 9+ play (I’m not saying how to parent). Good day to all parents.

An awsome miltary shooter sequel
Tom clancys latest game is a little buggy in coop, but still packs a awsome punch if you like shooter games and customazation. Few swears a little bit of blood but no organs or anything like that. No sexual inniwindows or consumerism other than a 1 year pass with sick dlcs relating to termanator or sam fisher plus free in game currany to customize your soldier nomad.A solid 9/10

Fun tactical shooter with friends
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is the latest installment in the highly acclaimed Ghost Recon series. After the release of the new "immersive mode", I believe that this game is making substantial improvements beyond the release. The regular experience is how the game was played at launch. I didn't really enjoy the looter shooter concept as it is used in plenty of other games. Luckily the immersive mode makes the game feel more realistic and tactical. The custom mode is a sandbox that lets you customize the settings to your liking. I would still prefer regular mode for beginners, as you can still switch between the different modes instantly through settings.

Campaign:
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint has a really great campaign. The story makes sense, and is overall fun. The game takes place in Auroa, a fictional island with a great variety of climate and environment. You play as a highly trained soldier and spy called "ghosts". The only downside to the campaign is the extremely long downtime between missions. Lots of traveling and exploring. I find the campaign a lot more memorable with friends.

PVP:
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint isn't we'll known as a PVP game but it still exists. The competitive game modes are fun and tactical.

Problems:
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint has a disappointing amount of microtransactions. Mainly cosmetic items and more. There game's camera system is strange and shifts in an odd way. Vehicles are fun to play around with, but they have horrible drifting which can lead to frustration.

Age Review:
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is a game necessary with friends and but can still be played alone. Overall, the violence is minimal. You shoot someone and there is little amounts of blood but no gore. Players use an arsenal of guns and explosives. Language however, is quite major in the story mode. F**k, s**t, b**ch, b***ard and more can be heard. Besides the story, the language isn't too bad. There are some sexual references in game but no scenes showcase it, with not much explicit detail. There are drugs in game, but nothing that your child hasn't seen in a movie or TV show. I'd be less concerned about that. Look Common Sense Media states, there is a torture cinematic cutscene but it's hardly shown. A man is strapped to a chair as a women interregates him. Afterwards the camera shifts off scene. If your child has read the original novel, "Ghost Recon" then the game may she similarities. In conclusion, decent game that's great with friends. Recommended for ages 13+

Sequel to Wildlands is frustratingly good and difficult
Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a sequel to Ghost Recon: Wildlands set in a massive and vast open world sandbox filled with tons of things to do, it's almost overwhelming. Including 30 hours worth of story missions, faction missions, side missions, encounters, raids and PvP.
Violence is frequent moderate. Gameplay wise, violence is moderately bloody. With blood sprays, big puffs of blood while also mildly staining the environment. Shotguns cause big puffs of blood. Headshots with pistols cause a small burst of blood. Shots from fully automatic weapons cause constant blood sprays. Cutscenes and cinematics show more graphic depictions of violence. Torture scenes are graphic with blood staining the ground in some scenes. Characters bleed out and die.
Language is frequent and strong. Use of the words "@$$", "@$$hole", "b#!ch", "f#!k", "motherf#!ker", "$h!t" are frequently heard in dialogue from cutscenes and gameplay. Example: "Shoot the f#!ker!", "What the f#!k?", "You've seen this place, god damn." and "Kill the son of a b!#ch!" Innuendo is present but infrequent.

Awful game with thrown away potential
Overhyped buggy mess. I played beta with my friends and right before release as well. Guns were buggy, but the cars had realistic drift mechanics (that was he only really good part). The M134 on the jeeps couldn’t turn and the game didn’t have an interesting
story. The “expert review” author either hasn’t played the game, or is oblivious to its quality. DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE!!!!!

Difficult and Strategically Challenging
This game definitely includes violence, its a tactical military shooter. You play as a US Spec-Ops soldier, in a game based off a novel if you care about that. The game does include swearing, but not too much. If you don't want to expose your children to Moral decisions, this is a good one because there is a clearly defined good guys vs bad guys and little in between. I'd recommend it for anyone not easily upset and can think strategically, and lastly has patience.
