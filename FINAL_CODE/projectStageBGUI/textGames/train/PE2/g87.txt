This game is ok
This game is what you would expect it's a normal ghostbusters game. The story of this game is ok and is appropriate for younger people the multiplayer is kind of stupid though and should have never been added to the game overall the game was okay

good game but it depends on the kid
when i was 7 i saw ghostbusters the movie and freaked out at the library scene

so i did think that this game's library mission was going to be scary but

the library ghost does pop out at you but is isint to bad it is the most scary mission

as for the reat of the game the first mission is in the firehouse basement

when slimer escapes you try and blast him but hit the storage unit

couse you are a new rookie and slimer takes one of his freinds with him

and you catch them mission #2 is the hotel slimer again!!!!!

and at the end the game is 10/10 for me like i said ages 10 and up

will like xbox 360/ps3 or ps2 ,8 and up wii/ds

Amazing!!!!
I own the Wii version and its so much fun!!!! I absolutely don't believe in violence but the element where you could destroy anything using the blast stream is the reason I find the game so entertaining!!!! The only bad language (or mean language for that matter) is "knucklehead" which Peter said.

It's pretty good. The last level is so dang hard!!! One level is pretty creepy, but I love the rest of the game.

good game for 9+
this game is great for 3rd grade and up the ghosts might scare younger kids but the controls are pretty easy

To sum it up, a down right good game!
Love this game, one of the best for the PS3 in my opinion and good for people who want to shoot the heck out of stuff without the extreme gore and violence. The only reason i put 12+ is because there were a few scenes were my siblings had their head buried in the pillow by fright! (Ages 8 and 9) The library scene is the worst but not too bad. I love this game! It is my all-time favorite. This game is a must have for any Ghostbusters fan!

Awesome game, Depends on Who Plays It
I get easily scared, and scary in this game isn't a concern for me. But the game is kind of jumpy, what with ghosts and some infrequent surprise attacks. And some scenes (involving a woman who was a serial killer who drained her victims of blood) are very eerie and creepy. Anyway, I barely noticed cursing, until it was pointed out. The weapons aren't real, but they're still weapons, so that may raise slight concerns. But that aside, it's a great game with easy controls once you get used to them. And it's pretty fun. Take it from me, a die-hard Ghostbusters fan. &lt;3

Not that much cursing or violent but it is based on a movie. There is
killing ghosts but not any other violent&#039;s it is easy to play.

This Game Is...Fairly Awesome, I Have To Say
Yeah, this game is flipping awesome. The language is a bit iffy, and really the only reason I put "iffy" instead of "on". The violence isn't too excessive, and only two or three sequences can be considered like, terrifying, though none scared me. I will admit to being slightly startled at some parts, but not too many. The controls are a bit hard to get used to (or maybe it's just me), but still, this game rocks my socks off! A+!

Awesome
It is a must for Ghostbusters fans. It has some good scares like the spider witch but it is really fun no blood at all and minor language.
