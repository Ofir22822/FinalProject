Good for Teens
Game is great. Fun, interesting. The game has a very low skill floor, and a very high skill ceiling. Many interesting, fun, unique characters to play as. There’s a character with a kit for any play style you can think of. The game is heavily based around a group of heroes, a group of villains, and a couple more neutral groups and characters, but the story revolves mainly around the ideals of heroes.

Game has some balancing issues but that’s the only real issue gameplay wise.

Biggest problem for younger audiences are the voice coms. The game is very dependant on teamwork and speaking with teamates, but that means you'll lose a whole lot if you’re playing competitive matches if you’re not in chat. This means that you’ll want to be in voice coms, but that also means that you’ll most definitely run into toxic players. Not knowing how to handle these players or being too young could make the game less fun to play,
Not much actual swearing in the game, but toxic players certainly bring that to the table. There’s obviously violence because it is a first-person class-based shooter. There’s a few revealing outfits in the game.

Great with slight violence
I think the game is good... But I don't love it. I think that there is a lot of joy for a lot of people, but it isn't quite for me. But u think it's fine for most kids. It teaches kids teamwork, and doesn't have any gore, just the guns. I think anyone above 8 is allowed to play it, but they probably won't understand it very well until they're around 11-12 years old. But there is loot boxes, which kids might put more money into.

LOVE IT
Where to start? This game is a great introduction to shooters. It has intuitive controls, easy-to-grasp abilities, and not much blood. The characters are mostly heroic and respectable, and aside from two (Reaper, who literally relishes the idea of death, and Sombra, who's just a power hungry freak), even the villains can be understood to a degree. I don't think that consumerism should be dialed up to a four, as you only but cosmetics, and unlike Fortnite or other games, your character is appealing and unique-looking without a skin or modification. Also, sex should certainly not be at two. I'm aware some characters are wearing things that aren't eskimo jackets (Oh wait! One character IS wearing an eskimo jacket!), but it seems wrong somehow. Some people bring up the unmonitered chat, but if you use the convenient communication wheel to talk, which has options like "Defend the checkpoint!" or "I need healing!", you could go entire matches without ever popping open the chat window. You can't not look at voice chat, which is uncensored as well, but you can mute it and that's that. The violence really isn't that horrible either, as a very small fraction of the characters have actual firearms. Most have swords, laser guns, giant hammers, small hammers, rocket launchers that are made of car parts, oversized gauntlets that shoot shrapnel, or other bizarre weapons. In other words, if you're okay with your child watching star wars or the chronichles of narnia, this should be okay in terms of violence. There is a cowboy in the game who smokes at all times, but I didn't even notice for the first month of playing the game. This doesn't really fit any catagories, but it should be said that when using their "ultimate" ability, all heroes will shoult out their catchphrase, and it will. Most of these are harmless, silly sayings like "Nerf this!", "It's high noon...", or other simple blips that let everyone know a powerful attack is coming. However, one character, Reaper, screams the word "DIE" repeatedly. You can turn off voice lines to prevent this, but then you can't hear the other ultimates coming and are at a disadvantage.

Toxic players, awesome game
I’ve played this game since last Christmas, and I love it. I wouldn’t let your kid play it if they are under 10.

Overwatch age requirement is over rated
The game has almost no violence at all, and is a great game for young kids and adults alike but something you should consider when buying the game is that it can get boring quite quickly well for me at least. Overwatch is basically the same thing over and over again but the skins and the over 30 heros can make that not so boring but i still found it boring when playing. Also a few heros do have bombs and one apears to be crazy which could be associated with drugs and some heros can scare kids like 'road hog' who is big has a mask and tattoos and some other things search it up on google. there is alot to buy in game. there is a also a voice chat. and a normal chat which is only on pc whilst voice chat is on all devices that you can play overwatch on.

Hero-Based First Person Shooter
Overwatch is a Hero-Based First Person shooter that is fun (if you casually play and don't pog) Community is toxic at times but game is good and fast-paced.

Best game ever
Appropriate game with violence that that is slightly cartoonish. I’ve been playing this game for just over 2 years and have never gotten sick of it. 100% would recommend for anyone who want a game to have fun with but also enjoy a competitive experience. As long as you’re old enough to have an understanding of how to play the game then I recommend you try it out.

great game just bewair
It is a great game, the violence in it is quite tame due to the fact that it is cartoon characters. The only thing I have to say is there is a bit of blood. I first discovered this when I shot a character in slow motion and saw the blood fly off their head. Also there's a few characters in this game that have quite revealing outfits. such as the character called Widow Maker, you can see her butt in the battle field. and another character called Tracer doesn't leave much to the imagination. So you must have a chat with your child about this, but really you don't notice it too much, although that doesn't mean it is ok.

I still prefer Paladins over Overwatch
Overwatch is good game, but Paladins is still better. Violence is the main factor. Animated blood appears but is sometimes hidden during the colourful battles and fast paced shootouts. Some characters wear "thicc" outfits and some revealing. The community sometimes comes up with theories and characters lore based on sexuality.

Great game with some mild problems
The best game I have ever played. While some characters will say d*mn when they take damage it is fine as long as your kid knows not to cuss. very cartoony violence with minimum blood. There is a character that smokes a cigar and there is beer and wine located around the map there is no bad thing to do with drugs. While some voicelines/sprays are not the best (The noose spray and reaper's voiceline, DIE DIE DIE) they are not very bad. some female characters are animated a little.... weird. Most character are nice and this is a great team building game. The Competitive mode should be played by older kids because it takes a lot of strategy and skill, the voice chat is mostly adults cussing, and people get really mad when they have a kid on their team. Great game overall. PS I put to much drugs and too much violence because there was no milder option

Great game!
There is some blood that is quite unnoticable from some characters, it appears as a small splash of red. One character is also seen with a cigarette in his mouth and one character is wearing some clothing that may be considered revealing. Nothing too graphic great shooter for younger kids who want to start playing FPS games. There is an option to spend money in-game on crates and it can be quite rewarding sometimes.

It should not be 13 up
How is this 13 up! First of all there is a little bit of violence but nothing compared to the Halo games. You buy it first and you have it forever until your console breaks down and no swearing at all (Apart from trash talkers but you can mute people so that is not a problem) No sex, No drugs apart from a Cowboy with a tobacco but that is nothing compared to the GTA games drugs,sex,swearing and themes. I reckon just Blizzard are just good and the game is nothing bad.

My opinion
Overwatch is a shooting game. Know that now. It costs maybe 40 dollars, (Origins?), but it has in-game purchases (loot-boxes, mostly.) which unlock cosmetics like skins for characters. Pay to play. Chat, both voice and text is largely unmonitored. General chat is an open zone, a lot of (for some reason alt-right vocabulary?) and slurs. Voice chat has the opportunity to be tame, but once you go towards Competitive levels of play (level 35ish and up) Voice can be hostile. Wouldn't rec for younger children. Best bet is 14-15+. No blood. Minor references to smoking. Promotes team play. If you have a particularly immature child, disable purchases / voice chat. Very fun.

Please Read
It is a really good game, YOU CAN LOCK VOICE COMMUNICATION WITH PARENT CONTROLS, so you kids don’t listen to 25 year olds who don’t have a job, there is no nutity or drugs or anything bad, honistly, it’s like a Disney game with guns that 1/2 the time
don’t exist and positive role models, and sayings that your child can listen to THERE IS NO CUSSING AT ALL!!! I think parents think that there is blood but there is not and you are killing BOTS NOT REAL PEOPLE COMMON SENSE MEDIA IS OVER RATING IT!

Best FPS without gore!
It's very cartoony and there isn't much blood or gore. It's a really fun game with lots of modes. You can learn a lot about teamwork as well as life lessons from the characters in the official short films.
