Great game
This is a great game, I got it for my son's birthday. He loves it and plays it with his friends, he is not addicted to it and will let me play with him from time to time. This game has no swearing and humors messages, it may have some shooting but most of the plants don't even shoot, only the zombies, I recommend this game to anyone who likes to laugh and play games with friends.

Harmless fun
I'm a bit of a gamer myself and when my daughter got this game I joined in. Nothing bad at all, just cartoon fun. The strategy elements are exciting and bottom line it's just a good time.

Great game! Fun for all ages!
My son started playing Plants vs Zombies when he was nine. I had my doubts at first as the zombies seemed very violent. But after enough pestering I let him try it. While there was a war going on it seemed like a very harmless game. There's no gore when a character is killed, they just disappear. I ended up letting my seven year old son join as well and they had a lot of fun together using the split screen option. The game has turned out great for fun family bonding and I think it is great for older teens.

Great Game Just Doesn't Achieve What It's Predecessors Did
This is the third entry in the Plants vs. Zombies shooter titles. I'm not going to say this is Garden Warfare 3, as the graphics are different, some of the controls are different, and it just has a very "different" feel to it. On to the appropriate for kids part. Age ratings are evil, by the way. First of all, there are absolutely no role models in this game at all. That isn't a bad thing, either. It's just that the characters don't do anything except blast each other. The weapons in the game are not in any sense realistic, and says the same for the violence, which just shows how much damage you do, then characters disappear when deceased. This game is not addictive, but can cause great anger In players, as it takes a long time to kill people, and the sprinting feature allows people to annoyingly run away from you, allowing other people to steal your kill. The game also has an entire community of players who won't let anyone catch a break, including ability spammers, ballers, players who will jump off cliffs to stop you from getting them killed, suicide chompers, night cap mains, husk hoppers, and oak spammers. This game has a ridiculous amount of flaws, but there are so many elements and features to the game, the pros dominate the cons. One problem is you can't play the competitive side of the game unless you have PS Plus or Xbox Live Gold. If you don't have these, you will be restricted to the PvE side of things, and you shouldn't be rushing out to buy the game. Also note that you must have PS Network or Xbox Live, plus you need to have or create an EA account, and have a stable internet connection to even start the game. Plus, you can't get the game on Switch. I know. That concludes this review. I hope you found this helpful.
Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville is out now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One.

As good as the previous one
A fun shooter that has fun modes for everyone. The free roam lobby may get confusing though. Also theres in game currency but it does make the player fell satisfied.

Good but disappointing
I got it a while ago, and whilst the game isn’t terrible, it is much worse than its predecessors. First up, the skins now don’t give you different weapons, which was a feature of GW2 I really enjoyed, although I guess the skins being just cosmetics does take away the pay to win element. Second, it’s really REALLY laggy. Third, it’s only online. There are no upsides today this. As a new player, it’s really hard to get better because the only ways to play are with other online players or shooting targets. So you have the option of too difficult or insanely boring. Fourth, the new characters. Why??? They are all really badly designed, far too powerful to be fair, or terrible.

There are some good bits though. Some of the new maps are awesome, the graphics are strange but exciting, and the new skins look cool.

This game is fun and any parent should be ok with this shooter
I love this game being a player of the garden warfare games and pvz heroes. This game has an official rating of E10+ cause fantasy violence. and I understand that there is so much you can do in game whether its helping out a football playing zombie to escort a washing machine with puberty-esque insecurities or helping a sheriff pea plant keep zombies in jail, this game is a fun time. This game is always fun to play with my friends and siblings and is just a goofy game to have fun with. I mean come on, a super hero zombie punching a cybernetic orange that shoots literal orange juice to kill zombies, how can you say this is bad for kids. This game is great for anybody. I have a friend, who's parents would never let him play a shooter like Halo or COD (Call of Duty), but this is the kind of shooter he could play with me, and it teaches people team skills being a game where it is 100% team based with no free-for-all modes at all. I guess you could say its good for your brainz, get it? Plus, I have some personal recommendations for your kids based on age: if your kid is ages 6-7 allow use the free roam regions on easy mode, for ages 8-9 allow them to use the lobby to play against their friends and bots and the free roam on any difficulty to avoid teammates who are not very nice in online multiplayer, and for ages 10+ give them free control over what they do in game.

New PVZ installment with good content
As someone who's played practically every Plants vs Zombies game, I'm happy to say that Plants vs Zombies: Battle For Neighborville is a fun and fresh game. If you've played the previous Garden Warfare games, then you know the basic idea of this one. It's a third person shooter that has the player fight the opposing team as a plant or zombie. You choose characters and play. The newest installment has some new mechanics such as sprinting, artwork, and characters. However, the single player "campaign mode" is disappointing as I still want a fully fledged out story instead of basic missions. It's fun and entertaining but not the best. Luckily this game has multiplayer, which is where it shines. Lots of similar gamemodes make a return, and since new ones arrive. Like always, it's a very unique and entertaining experience. The game is missing features that were critical in previous games, like character variations.

Age Review:
It's not the best the series has been but it's worth grabbing on sale. You play as a plant or zombie, and you fight. No "actual" guns but it's still a shooter. The game has zombies in it but they're not scary in any way. They are in fact humours. Little to no violence, no language, and no sex. Recommended for ages 5+

indoor exercise for kids who hate exercise
My 10 year old begs to do this, he gets sweaty and tired after an hour. My 4 year old wanted to try, he loves it and only needs help reading the story and a few instructions. He does great too, sweaty and happy and gets tired. Nothing too scary or mature.

It gives them both great exercise, at their level, and they think its so much fun they want it every day, sometimes twice a day. It does target all the major muscle groups and gives decent aerobics. Gives tips on staying healthy, hydrated, reminds kids to drink water, rest, listen to their bodies. Virtual smoothies teach about healthy foods.

My husband and I tried it, and for us it was fun, just not fun enough that we want to do it every day. We got a decent workout too.
