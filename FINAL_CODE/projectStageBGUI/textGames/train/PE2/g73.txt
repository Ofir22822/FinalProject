Not at all violent
This is a wonderful interactive game that has literally no violence or blood
There is none at all!! I am normally Very anti-violence games and would never allow such a game. But after playing the trial myself, I was think wow this game is not like halo or call of duty its like Minecraft. It promotes great messages and there are great role models these is no language or anything. It helps sharpen eye hand coordination and helps a lot for basketball players. My son was a short kid and was an absolute couch potato. Playing 24-7 now he plays over watch 30 mins a day only!! and is the best on his basket ball team. This also Helps increase your child's social intelligence. Overall I would buy this game for 10 yr olds.

Overwatch: Has major pros but cons...? 9/10
Before outwardly exclaiming "You'll buy the game and everything in it" you may want to carefully analyze my review. I find that the gameplay is crisp up to 1080p and maybe 4k rendering given your devices or hook ups. The fps is smooth in question up to 60 and over speed. Any game, wheth ... continue reading

TF2 with less blood, better graphics
Overwatch is a great example of a first person shooter that's fun and engaging without too much gore. While other games in the genre are packed with spurting blood and wince-inducing violence, Overwatch is just as fun and fine for younger kids. If you're particularly stringent when it comes to online safety, then it is noticeable that there's a chat feature.

Fantastic game! Great sub for those violent shooting games!
If your child wants this or any shooting games this is probably as kid friendly as your going to get. It's a great sub if your kid wants a shooter that's just to violent It's kooky funny and happy with some stylised violence. And with all of that its fun and a good game! Recommendations: have a time limit 30mins it's very addictive so learn to resist, have a risk assessment! Even let your parents have a go!

Enjoyable fun game with some blood and violence
Overwatch is an fps that empowers both men and women whilst keeping the mechanics simple and fun. Violence is cartoonish and brief splatters of blood can be seen when an enemy is hit . Players are also rewarded for kills and eliminations. Some female characters are scantily clad with revealing cheats, but nothing more than that. Parents may also more that one player smokes tobacco, and cigars are visible on sprays

Violence is very mild
I bought this game for my 12 year old daughter and 10 year old son and I'm not such a big fan of letting kids play first person shooters because of violence but guess what? The violence in this game is actually extremely mild and if you are fine with your child watching PG movies this is perfectly fine. Common Sense Media says this should be 13+ but I think an average 11 year old can easily handle the violence, the violence is actually very mild, unrealistic and not bloody at all. The player is in the role of a hero fighting against the baddies so the game has positive messages. The game has no sexual content, bad language or drinking/drugs (other than a character smoking a cigar which as long as your child knows not to smoke is fine) so I would recommend this game for ages 11 and up.

Great!
I bought this game for my son because it is not too violent. My son is 13 and wanted to get Overwatch. My son has seen countless pg-13 and some R rated movies. This game seems very mild as far as first person shooter games go. He is responsible, and I am completely fine with my son playing Overwatch.

Good game, not too violent
I am not a fan of first person shooter games, or video games in general. When my son first asked me for this game I was skeptical. I researched overwatch online and found that it didn't look terribly violent. My son has seen many pg-13 movies, some of which were more inappropriate than this game. I'm not very happy with him playing overwatch, but I allowed him to buy it. As far as first person shooters go this is not bad. And I am comfortable with him playing it.

CSM Back At It Again With The Too Old Ratings
Here is the motto of Common Sense Media.
"If the game is teen it must be rated by us 13 or higher"
But come on this is Overwatch.
Overwatch has no profanity, sex, or drugs.
I don't count a cowboy smoking tobbaco drugs. He isn't smoking a blunt.
I don't count a mildly provocative character as sex. Bare nudity? No. Full Nudity? No. Sex Scenes? No! Sex is at a 0.
Of course there is violence in a fighting game! But the blood is about as equal to the Skylanders series which is at a 5 for commercialism because having all characters will cost a whopping 3000 dollars (around). However this game got a 4 rating which is one measly less.
All you buy in this game is cosmetics not freaking characters like SkyScammers and BattleBorn The Leach. CMS states the game has lots of merchandise like t-shirts and toys. Every game does. But not everygame has a level 4 on commercialism!
Characters getting dismembered? Why is this in the age review!!! The training robots and one robotic character will fall apart upon death with no blood! Just like in SkyScammers.
Honestly an 8 year old can play this game without it tainting their mind but they'll never get the chance when parents see the number 13 up there. Take it from me. This is fine for the average eight year old!

There are also pretty good messages and role models with a very nice moral background which communicates the goods and bads of wars as well as multiple viewpoints too not only educate but immerse their viewers in a realistic world that is unrealistic. LOL!

It's very easy to play the game. Characters take seconds to learn but hours to master just like a good fighting game should do. Button mashing will get you nowhere but good reflexes, playstyle, and strategy will!

The game is a blast and CMS is famous for not allowing great games to be played by younger audiences when they should be!

Attention to parents who won't let their child get the game.
This is the most kid friendly FPS I've ever played. There is no sexual content or swearing. The violence is NOTHING compared to a 12+ movie and I think a 10 year old of average maturity should be fine with this game. There is virtually no blood and if parents are concerned about the shooting, you are playing as the good guy fighting the bad guy and it doesn't look very realistic. Also most of the time you are fighting against cartoony robots not real people. The game is actually very cartoony and doesn't look real at all. The game also helps with your child's team building skills and reaction times. If your child is over 10 or 11 parents should have nothing to worry about, it's NOWHERE near as violent as most 12+ movies and overall a kid-teen friendly game, so this is a great gift for ages 10 and over.

Here goes CSM horrible rating
Okay, before we start, I have been playing OverWatch since launch. I currently sit in the diamond rank which people believe to be the most toxic. Yes, there is a bad egg or two, but there is no reason that this game should be given a rating like CSM did. The game includes many things to get rid of them. The game allows you to avoid people, so you don’t end up in their voice chat and there is the option of leaving a voice channel and muting them. The game includes no drugs, unless you think a cowboy with a cigar is worthy of a drug rating. He’s also smoking a normal cigar, not weed or crack. No sex in the game, to be honest nothing bad at all. Would highly recommend

Fun Game but toxic online community
This game is really fun and not very inappropriate ... UNTIL you turn on voice chat, people are either extremely toxic(mean) or say stupid stuff. Some of the outfits are slightly revealing but who cares, it's not that bad. There also isn't a lot of blood and for some reason some of the time the characters yell out "d*mn" but not very frequently.

**Avoid competitive if you play on PC because the ranking system is really bad and even if you are really good you'll stay in Gold or below unless you are a pro. It's just toxic and rage inducing, no one should have to go through it kid or adult, just stick to arcade and quick play unless you are a pro***

Another CMS over rating.
Listen, listen. As a video game connoisseur i think I have the right to speak on the matter on this game.

Children are gullible, I know, I shouldn’t be saying it. But the fact of the matter is this is the most family friendly shooter game ever made. I got this game at the age of ten, and I will never forget some of the incredibly nice people on this game. Sure, there are some “toxic” gamers who play Overwatch, however, they are generally nice once you calm them down and get to know them.

There is 2 bits of profanity from the characters, however it is hardly noticeable even if you have good ears.

Team building is key in this game. If anyone says different I suggest they actually play the game and see for themselves. Communicating with other teammates about “not pressing” or “staying back” is litterally the basis of the entire game.

A child with the maturity of a goldfish could play this game. This game is the best shooter game if you don’t want your children to have the more violent, grotesque games like COD or Battlefield.

Perhaps the most kid-friendly FPS out there
While there are ever-so-slightly less violent FPS that have managed to get an E/E10+ rating, I would consider Overwatch the more kid-friendly game. As Common Sense Media mentioned in their review, Overwatch has unique good messages to it, such as that morality is not always black or write, how to overcome obstacles and work with others. The violence is relatively mild, even when compared to other T-rated shooters. For example, Halo 5 had a bit more realism to it, and the blood splatter was on-screen for longer. In Overwatch, blood is infrequent, and the whole game has an abstract style to it separating it easily from reality.

No Drugs Or Sex
There is no sex or drugs in it other than the cigar used by one of the characters. This game focuses on strategy rather than violence and teaches kids a lot about tactics. There is no point to not get this game for your children. Great game! I think kids 8 and under cannot handle the online interactions although, and thus I rate it 9 and up!

CMS know how to over exaggerate
The common sense media review is completely ridiculous. There is 0 sex AT ALL. There are 0 drugs AT ALL. The closest you can get to a drug is a cowboy smoking a cigar, but what do you expect? PG tv shows have people smoking cigars soo what's the problem? Very little blood, guns are cooler than they are dangerous. Dismemberment of a character? There's a robot character when he dies spring and screws go everywhere... When a character explodes, it's body just turns to a rag doll. I hate the poor kids that are told no over getting this game because CSM said its 13+ and gave false info.

DON'T LISTEN TO CSM!
I don't know why CSM says that it is 14+! The only thing I can think of is unmoderated chat. It helps teamwork, communication, and thinking ahead. You work in a team of 6 to either take control of, or defend a certain point, and players need to communicate to do well. It has MILD violence, nothing very bad. Some characters, such as Widowmaker, have some cleavage, but not as bad as some things. Overall, an amazing game, I would recommend this to anyone (who is mature) 8+.

Great game, Least Violent FPS Game I've ever played.
Overwatch is an excellent game and definently one of my favorites. It's nothing like any other FPS game I've ever played. I would personally say that this should be rated E10+ rather than T. For some reason, CMS says that character dismememberment is in this game, when a character dies there is NO dismemberment (except for the ROBOTIC character, Bastion). Also, over half of the roster doesn't have guns (not counting laser guns as a gun). There is extremely little blood that is rarely seen. This game also isn't like a normal FPS game that's extremely dark. The overall vibe of the game is about heroism. And the graphics are in an animated Pixar style. This game has no sex, and no drugs or alcohol. One character smokes a cigar, though. I would highly recommend this game to any family with children 10 or over.

A battleground full of character!!!
First of, lets get something out the way, by no means is this game stereotypical or sexist. Yes, some women have revealing outfits, but the same could be said for some of the men. You could say the characters use "drugs" to heal themselves which even saying that is over exaggerating. And literally there is no blood or gore just a few bullets so the violence is low to a mature standard. Now the ACTUAL game, its excellent. While sometimes it gets a little bit repetetive, the character and feel-good vibe with the bright map design could keep you addicted for hours. Also, teamwork and skill is a LARGE part of this game so young children might learn a thing or two. Over all, Its brilliant. Go out and buy it RIGHT NOW.

Very solid game
Overwatch is a very solid game, really fun and easy to play. It is an FPS with guns but there isn't any blood and the guns look really futuristic and more cool than violent. Nothing wrong with this game at all. As long as you know how to play as a team and with good strategy this is great.

Action packed FPS for teens and kids alike.
If this isn't kid friendly, i dont know what is. One of the characters is a hamster from the moon. And for the alleged "tobacco usage", it's one character (also, is there a kid who doesn't know that you shouldn't smoke by now?). Ninjas, cowboys, robots, more robots, what's not to like? The violence and shooting is very mild. Most don't even use bullets, it's usually just lasers. Blood? Please. Other than a red outline of the screen when you're hit, there's nothing. Players just go ragdoll when they die. No gore or anything. It's also not very realistic. Almost every aspect is cartoony. It also teaches strategy, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. The conflict is also good guys vs. bad guys. like anything, really. This is a great game for kids and literally anybody.


(P.s.: if you dont want voice chat, just turn it off.)

Really CSM?
Common sense media has rated this too high once again. Parents, ignore the comment about the character McCree, as he is only smoking a cigarette, and you cannot even see it once you are in game. Yes, there is voice chat, but you can turn that off in settings. There is no blood, just a little red ring around the edge of your screen when you are hurt. The guns are futuristic and not realistic in the slightest. Overall great game and CSM has rated it too high on age

Great first FPS game
I've been playing for a few weeks and its really easy to get the hang of. The blood is very minimal. Yes some of the heroes have fairly revealing clothing *cough*Widow maker*cough*. Over all a great game and definitely suggest trying it.
