Excellent game. One of my favorites!
This is an excellent game that requires critical thinking and planning. My biggest complaint is that the "effectiveness" of the teacher/instructor you play in the game is based almost solely on how much you pander to what students want to hear. The students are older teenagers (then, later in the game in their early 20s) so there is a fair amount of mild flirting and references to some of the characters being promiscuous and one of the adults drinking too much. For the most part, the game's violence is pretty tame. Characters are seen using weapons against enemies, but the gore is very low. The exception are a few of the key cut-scenes which are pretty gratuitous and visceral. Because of the strategic leveling up of characters/units, I would find it surprising if players under the age of 13 could finish this game. I would also mention that none of the paths through this game are unproblematic; they all require being complicit to some degree with what may be seen as poor ethical judgement for "the greater good."

Great, but darker than most Fire Emblem games
This newest addition to the Fire Emblem series takes a darker turn, when the cutscenes and dialogue involve massacres, getting stabbed, and other violent deaths of characters. There is not much language, besides d***. It is a lot more realistic, and the characters are relateable, and whichever house you don't choose, and the characters you don't recruit, you will be forced to kill later. Many characters have tragic backstories. There are many innuendoes, and one character is called, "a skirt chaser" by his house leader. This is the first Fire Emblem game to have same-gender marriage options. There are a few flirty characters, and a few females have revealing outfits, although they are not nearly as terrible as other characters from other Fire Emblem games. Gameplay wise, the game is amazing, and it really makes you think hard about where to put your characters and how to keep them safe. It's much more advanced than your average Fire Emblem game, and it has new features. However, I prefer the older games. Gameplay is a bit difficult, so it takes a while to get used to the controls. There are a few references to alcohol.

Great story and gameplay, deep messages and conflicts that could be better understood by older kids
The game features a lot of great storytelling but the decisions to choose between houses and go against former allies can be difficult and at times heartbreaking, moreover theres a lot of violence and gore (although toned down than it realistically should be) that can make the game better suited for older teenagers. Otherwise it's a great game set in a land akin to Medieval Europe that emphasizes creating bonds with your students and making the right decisions.

An amazing strategy RPG, with a few more serious parts
Being a big Fire Emblem fan myself, I have to say it’s not as bad as some of the other games. The game has you choose between 3 of the academy’s houses, which gives you different endings for the different houses. You always fight the good fight, defeating baddies during missions. Some of the students wish to be knights, hence the duty, honor, and chivalry. The gameplay is very straightforward and simple once you get used to it a bit. Language is very mild, with some of the words “damn” and “hell” used rarely. There is almost no gore whatsoever (At one point there is blood shown on a knife, but not the victim).

Warning! Mild spoilers: During the second part, you are engaged in a war, which your character is the commander of an army. Lots of talk about war and it’s consequences during this part.

So anyway, this game is good for 11 year olds at minimum, or maybe a ten year old, depending if they are mature enough to handle some emotional parts.

Good but easy
I love fire emblem especially the older titles such as on the gba. This one’s pretty good too expect being a lot easier. You can turn back time so if you mess up, it doesn’t really matter. There’s a bit of language like hell and crap but nothing crazy. Some characters wear revealing outfits but nothing like the past entry: Fates. The main thing I would say that isn’t the greatest for younger kids is the complex story. A great deal of characters all of have past trauma and have committed crimes. The story is also primarily anti-religion so religious families may feel uncomfortable with it.

Good, exercises your brain
This is a great game, it forces you to make very hard decisions, especially if you chose to do classic mode, where if one of your units dies, they are dead for good. I borrowed this game from a friend and it was great. I have played other fire emblem games, and this was my favorite. Although, the cutscenes show very violent deaths, (no spoilers) but the deaths in the game itself are not violent.

WOW. JUST WOW.
I love this game.
The animated cutscenes look stunning,The story is engaging,the characters are great, the gameplay is fun(Although quite hard), the voice acting is solid, the music is memorable....
I've never got sucked into a game this hard ever since Cuphead.
However, you can't have a same sex marriage with a samurai magician from the middle ages in Cuphead,so....
The game has mild language,intermediate violence and romance elements that make it suitable towards teenagers and above.
I have a few nitpicks, but those mostly don't matter.

Awesome soundtrack but dark themes
In this game, you play as a professor and a mercenary (male or female) in an academy in Garreg Mach. You lead one of three houses (excluding the DLC) and lead your students to excellence. The game is loosely based on a fantasy version of Christian Europe, where wyverns (pretty much dragons) and magic exists.

This is rather violent, but only during
cutscenes will the blood show. And even if it shows, it will be darkened or sometimes even black. Kids who buy this game might have problems understanding the games themes or dialogue, or the combat systems, but there are many visual guides and explanations. There's not much swearing; characters sometimes say damn, hell, crap, and minor swears, but the occasional 'bastard' that is only said 1 or 2 times. Many characters are nobles and some are even born in poverty, but that doesn't stop them from achieving their own goals and becoming knights or leaders of kingdoms. The blood is also replaced by screams or yells of pain, but some characters express remorse for them. There is only one highly suggestive character, and that is Manuela. She is an opera dancer and has a terrible love life. She often tries to date you and sometimes even says that her cooking has been labeled seductive. There is one skirt chaser who pretty much dates every girl he sees, even going so far as to date chickens, horses and even someone's grandmother. Though these relationships last less than a day and are only for laughs. Love is a prominent theme in FE3H as you can build bonds with characters. You can increase them by sharing a meal, cooking with them, gifting, finding a lost item, conversing and even through battle. Once a bond has been raised to S, you can ask them out at the end of the game and marry them. There are also same sex relationships. This game can be light-hearted sometimes where there is no conflict going on but can get dark even to the point of you having to kill your own friends that you spent time with.

Great!
This game is great, and easy to play (depending on what difficulty you choose) but has mild sexual themes ranging from going on dates (tea parties) with others to marrying other characters. This game is really good, and more about the characters than about the gameplay and story. There is also no blood in the game, although people do die and are murdered.

Great mind bending challanging game
This game is easy to pick up and start playing but I had a lot of trouble finishing it so if your getting it for younger kids this game gets really tough and they might get frustrated but other than that this game is an amazing buy. The other concern is online play and you can't control how other people will talk and act soo if your kids are younger id stay clear of that until they are at least 13.

Rated 15 (strong violence, threat, language, bloody images, suicide references, sexual threat, horror, drug misuse).
SEX/NUDITY - There is some sensuality and passionate kissing in one scene, where two characters make out on a bed (no nudity). One scene gives the player the opportunity to go into a back alley with a man to perform sex, in order to get money for food; she gets on her knees, implying she would perform oral sex, however she refuses anyway before anything can actually take place. In refusing, the man gets annoyed and demands that she is going to "take it", otherwise threatening that he will "get real mad". Before anything else can happen, her linked supernatural being intervenes by strangling the man, and the main character escapes. There is some very mild nudity in a couple of shower scenes, although it is in no way sexualised nor explicit in its portrayal, mainly showing bare backs. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are sequences of strong violence throughout the gameplay and cutscenes. While much of the violence is more action-orientated (hand-to-hand combat scenes, action set pieces) and has less emphasis on the strength of the violence, there are some stronger moments where the violence is more disturbing and shocking, or has bigger emphasis on the infliction of pain and injury. An example of these stronger moments include a torture scene, where a character is cut with a knife on the arm, and it is heavily implied his eye is gouged out with a knife. While lacking in explicit detail or gory visuals, there is still some sight of blood and the whole scene is very intense. Another example is when your linked entity possesses a soldier to commit a mass shooting on a group of government officials in a foreign country: there is more emphasis on bloody impact detail than other moments of violence. Furthermore, another example is when a group of homeless people (one of whom is the main character) are threatened and attacked by a gang of thugs wielding baseball bats, and the leading member knocks out the main character. He also hits her again while she is incapacitated, and a pool of blood can be seen around her head. Other moments of strong violence include shootings and stabbings with limited bloody detail. There are also sequences of supernatural violence when beings from another realm torment the main character. PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck"), and milder terms used throughout. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There is some drug misuse when players have the opportunity to smoke marijuana at a party, which causes the character to feel light headed. There is also sight of alcohol consumption, and one character is mildly depicted as an alcoholic. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent scenes of strong threat throughout, including some psychological threat and supernatural horror. There is also an element of sadistic threat in the interrogation scene. The entire game is very suspenseful, and also emotionally intense, and contains some mature themes. In addition, there are some points where the player can attempt suicide, such as the character finding a knife and beginning to cut her wrists (brief bloody detail) before being stopped, as well as attempting to jump off a bride into a busy road where she is again stopped before anything can occur. The theme of suicide is briefly touched upon in some scenes.

15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.

No worse than a typical DC/Marvel superhero movie
There is very occassional use of strong language, and a couple of sex scenes with very limited nudity. Other than that, this is basically very similar to a superhero movie or TV show. It touches on some difficult themes and issues such as bullying, homelessness, and CIA's covert military operations, which your kids may not understand or even pick up on. But it certainly isn't unsuitable for them to play it.

Don't let kids under 18+ play this.
You should never let your kids under 18+ play this rated M (Mature) for 17 and up like me. I can play it because I'm a adult. 21 years of age. So, I admit in you not allowing your kids that are under the age of 21 and up. Beyond Two Souls does have cussing in like fu** and Sh** and bit**.

An EXPERIENCE filled with tears and jeers.
As an experience, Beyond: Two Souls is an intense and dramatic ride where you will laugh, cry, and mostly cry. But as a game, the challenge falls short- wait a second, that's right, there is none. Seriously, I'm pretty sure you can't die or fail at all in the game, even when you mess up the button prompts. It's not to say that Beyond is bad, it just shouldn't be considered a game.

If you are a parent planing on buying the game for their child, here are some things you should know. And if you're anyone wanting to buy the game for yourself, stop reading and read another review because there are some major spoilers here. First, there are some very mature themes in this game, including, but not limited to child molestation, underage drinking, corrupted military officials, suicide, a mother having to give away her child, and of course, lots and lots of violence. It should be noted however that the player usually has a choice on how they can go about these situations. Although most bad situations inevitably happen anyway, the player still has some choice in the actions the protagonist takes. For example, in one scene the protagonist is at a party, and birthday girl offers you some beer. You have to option whether or not to actually drink it. As for sex, it really isn't anything you wouldn't see from a PG-13 movie. Jodie (the protagonist) gets naked a few times, but her breasts, butt, and private parts are never exposed. You have an option if you want to have sex or not, including a comment where Jodie says "We still have time before I have to go." to one of her possible love interests, but the sex itself is always cut out. There is also a scene where Jodie gets molested by three older men in her teens, but Aiden, the entity that is bound to her, kills them before they can do anything too graphic. Harsh language is also very frequent, especially from the main character, and can't be turned off. There is blood where it is necessary, and it also can't be turned off. The game (or whatever it's called) has a positive message at the end saying that loved ones will always be with you, even after they have passed. That being said, the game is also very depressing since nothing ever seems to go Jodie's way, and she can be seen frequently crying. This may not be a good idea if your teen is going through depression, because it might make them feel worse.

not for kids.
beyond two souls is an average game based on the similar game that David cage made heavy rain stars with two familiar actors Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe but parents due to the mature themes beyond two souls is not for kids this game is only for adults and parents you need to know that beyond two souls has some intense violence many in which Players can punch and kick human enemies, choke them and break their necks, and use guns and knives to kill soldiers. Blood appears around wounds. Assuming the role of a ghost, players can possess enemies and make them kill themselves. There are also scenes of torture, and one scenario depicts a trio of men attacking a young woman in a failed attempt to rape her although there is no sex or nudity there is Another scene shows a character propositioning fellatio, and yet another has the player's character actively delivering a baby only side angles with bare thighs are shown there is constant strong language used and there is smoking and drinking used such as beer and marijuana.
