Not the best
This game is fun but only for a short amount of time. This game gets boring easily. I played this a lot when I was growing up though. Basically there is a monkey in a ball that has to pass the finish line as quick as possible, but while you’re at it you also have to collect as many bananas as possible for extra points. I recommend to users that like cartoon challenge/racing.

What’s in the game?

Cartoon Violence - Players spend most of their time racing through tracks, but there are boss battles that pit players against large enemies. Combat generally involves dodging enemy attacks while charging up and rolling your ball into them.

A waste of money
I say it’s 18 plus because it’s near impossible to play. Unless you are a wizard. The graphics are gorgeous it’s why I bought the game. But it’s controls are laggy, there are so many enemies and you take almost half a bar with every hit. On top of that you can’t heal. Not easily at least. I’ve played it for 2 hours and made it maybe 3 minutes in the game because it’s impossible not to die.

This review is BS
Ok. I'm reading this review and I think these people went way overboard with their review. First, kids need to know about this stuff in the world. Second, this only refers to the campaign, as in multiplayer, you can barely see the blood. In the campaign, there are maybe a few bad scenes, but you can turn Gore and Dismemberment off in the settings. These people are crazy, and I think they need to play multiplayer, too

Incorrect
Firstly you know this is wrong when it says it has no role model value because it does. The video even said it itself when there are police and armed forces protecting country’s from terrorist threats. Surely armed forces hold some kind of role model value. This game in multiplayer mode is really not that bad and only a little cloud of blood when you kill someone. The language I admit is quite bad but it depends if you think your kid is mature enough. Multiplayer is not bad at all and campaign swears a little bit. I hope this review can help you decide on what you want to do.

CSM wrong AGAIN!!!
I have 2 children aged 11 and 12 asking for the new call of duty despite knowing this game was fairly brutal I decided to look into the game after seeing CSM review It was a definite NO. I later reviewed the parent comments and found out there were filters put in place to add a younger a ... continue reading

READ THIS BEFORE NOT LETTING YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME
Call of duty Moden Warfare 2019 is rated M in America and MA in any other part of the world and I live in Australia so one day when my son came up to me and asked for this game I looked it up and saw that it was rated MA but then found out that you can turn of the blood, gore and swearing so it makes the game rated M and not MA. So I let my son get the game and I watched him play it for a bit and I made sure that he turned the blood and swearing off. And......
It really wasn’t that bad at all! The campaign is vey good because it teaches kids about war and history which in my opinion is great! Also the multiplayer has literally no blood at all! Even if you have the blood on there still won’t be any blood in the multiplayer!
Also kids these days are very mature so they can very easily handle this.
So if your kid is 11 or over and they ask to get this game, definitely say yes!

Don't bother going through a history class on modern war just pick up this game
This game is so ok for 12+ not 18+
It is a great game because it teaches you about what is going on around the world in this type of war. It shows what people are risking to keep the world safe against terrorists.

Totally fine for kids.
I was reading other reviews that parents gave and they were way too serious. Like bruh 17 and up on the game case is BS first off. There are games TOTALLY rated M but they go Waay over board by saying “HECK” like wtf? But great for kids. Teaches about modern wars and is greatly dragged out in terms of the campaign, the general concept and playing aspects.

Grand game
I am a mother of 3 boys 2 of whom are currently receiving second level education and I was always against them playing TOO much xbox and screens in general. My middle child who is now 13 and is starting to mature a bit asked me if he could get a game call call of duty modern warfare. He explained to me how the game works (bearing in mind I have never allowed him get Call Of Duty games before. I looked into it a bit and saw reviews mainly saying it is okay for teens 13 and up so I allowed him get it and he was very grateful for me allowing him to have it because a lot of children in his age group were playing it and talking about it and he wanted to join in their conversations. It may be worth noting that this is his first year in a new school and he was very anxious about fitting in. The game has 18 on the box but I did research and found out that provided you turn off blood and swearing that makes a game 16s so I deemed it acceptable for him to play. I sat with him once and I have to say he was having fun and it was not too bad when you put it in context. It actually taught him a lot about modern day war. So I think the game is fine for 13 and up.

This game is amazing and definitely NOT 18+
i have been playing this game for a couple months and it is great. the campaign might be scary for younger kids but if your child is at least 11 and mature he should be fine. it has a little bit of scary images and torture but if you turn off the blood and gore it should be ok. The multiplayer is a lot of fun and lot like the old cod. Your child will have a great time playing this and connecting with friends.

Uncreative
The story is sure touching, but, in a way, completely uncreative as 99% of the original ideas and script were STOLEN from the real and original Modern warfare. The game should be sued for literaly stealing the name and proper title of its predecessors and the creators charged for copyrighting a predecessing title.

Use common sense
I think it's all subjective to the child. As a parent you have to decide whether or not your child is capable of understanding what's happening and emotionally able to distinguish between a video game and IRL.

Not 18+
Look, it’s teaching whoever plays about real life, well, modern warfare. It encourages and in fact tells you not to kill civilians, and also teaches to not be trigger happy. It may be a sensitive topic but children these days have experienced these things and parents shouldn’t pretend that their child isn’t ready and mature enough for it. Language, your child probably speaks like that normally to his friends by age 12. Blood, it’s only a slight mist, and it teaches the brutality of war and why it’s not good. There are outstanding role models, both female, and male. Race, gender, and other topics are all not discriminated and you play as several different ones. It is a great game and is just lazily grouped with other Call of Duty games.

information for parents
I have been watching my son playing this game for the past week and a bit. Now as a parent I care a lot about my son and at first, I was hesitant to oblige to my son's pleas for me to purchase the game for him. I was also wary of the MA15+ rating but to overcome my queries and quell any questions of the true age limit. I decided to purchase the game and play it myself and soon came to discover that the game's campaign (story mode) is the more violent and darker part of the game but it also came out with some positives. one being that it shows great role models in the commanding officers also it shows how no gender or race prejudices as one of the highest-ranked officers and one of the few people that play a continuous roll throughout the game. the only concern that I had at the end was the slight mist of blood but that can easily be switched off in the settings before letting your child play.

now the multiplayer aspect of the game to me has the one negative in the light mist of blood. other than that the multiplayer part of the game is a sandbox where your child can play with their friends try out a new thing and complete the everpresent challenges that keep you on your toes. another thing that makes the game a lot easier on your child is the skill-based matchmaking. Now, this is only active when your child is playing online. What it does is puts your child into the game with similarly skilled players I found this great as when my son was playing he wasn't outmatched but able to have an enjoyable time.

the other parts of the game such as the multi

Great game
This game is brilliant however if you have a child 10 or under I would say avoid letting them play the campaign but the multiplayer is completely fine so is the spec ops. This game isn’t bad but the campaign can be a bit mature at times but it does have positive messages and I would definitely recommend this game to 11 year olds.

Hard hitting but brilliant campaign, great multiplayer
Most parents reviewing this wont have actually played the game but i have gone through the whole campaign and put hours into multiplayer. The campaign deals with heavy subjects including terrorist attacks in which civilians are gunned down/blown up. There are scenes of suicide bombers, stabbings, graphic gas attacks and obviously a lot of shooting. There is also a house storming mission in which gives the player the option to shoot unarmed people however this is meant to be avoided. None of this is glorified however and it really does show a realistic sense of modern warfare.

The multiplayer is just your average call of duty game in terms of violence however and if your kid just wants this side of the game, i think it would be fine for anyone over 12.

Overall the game is very violent and can be disturbing in places however it is a brilliant game that mature teens would be fine with.

Really great game and not that violent
This is a great game as i play it myself.
The violence is probably the main cocern for people so i will cover that first. There is obviosly going to be violence because it is call of duty. The thing is, the fighting is always fast paced so most of the time you wont know whats going on. When you shoot an enemy there is a small bit of blood that comes out of them. The violence happens at long range so you wont be able to see it up close. There are also finisher moves but they are either just stabbing someone or shooting them. When you are shot your character grunts and your screen goes a bit red so you know you have been shot. ALL VIOLENCE CAN BE TURNED OFF. This means that your child wont see any blood or gore. There is in-frequent swearing using words such as the f and s words. Overall, with the blood and gore turned off, it would be sutible for all people age 14 and over.

Another good cod game
Amazing. There is aload of swearing but it’s battlefield language, nothing worse to what children will hear in schools. The gore isn’t extreme but can be at times. 10/10 for ages 11+

Great game, but very violent and brutal.
CSM definitely went a little overboard with their review. The game is violent and brutal, but it isn't terrible compared to other things. I think the violence is more in terms of context. For example, on one of the missions you are dealing with a terrorist attack on London, and you come across a man with a bomb vest strapped to his chest. The timer begins to run out, and there's really nothing you can do for him, so one of the other characters from the game pushes him off the edge of the building. You don't really see anything, you see him go off the edge, followed by an explosion. It's violent because of the fact that you couldn't save an innocent man who had children (he pleads for you to save him so that he can see his children). Overall, the game isn't very bloody, and if you want to you can turn all the blood and dismemberment off in the settings. I think more mature teens can handle this game, but it's definitely not for anyone under the age of 14. In terms of quality, it's a very great game with smooth controls and a fun and suspenseful campaign that I think anyone will enjoy.
