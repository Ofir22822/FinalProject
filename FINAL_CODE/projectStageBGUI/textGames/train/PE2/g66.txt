Nit picking
Okay so hear me out, I think how you represent the game is bogus. You must be a softcore gamer or just trying to pump out quality quickly because the outer worlds is chalk full of choices and consequences. There is consumerism. I mean the whole plot is that big corporations have taken over the colony. I don't know if you guys even play the game or just watch some random guy on youtube. Another topic I'll pick at it positive role models- in an RPG game its a given there are role models. The description you give for positive role models fits the bill if you said there were role models so I don't understand why you don't just put like 3 stars. Everything else seemed spoton- this is a great game where tons of love was poured into it and that's what I want to see more of- not cash in triple A games or indies but something in-between where it s clear everyonr loved working on it.

Great Action/Adventure/RPG game!
This game is amazing. While it has minor blood (cartoonish at that) the game is far from mindless killing. The open world and extensive choices remind me of Skyrim. The Intense violence and Blood and Gore is an major exaggeration, and there is minor mild language and one drug reference. It really is a game for 15+. ERSB has exaggerated many titles this is one of which.

Cartoonish space game for older teens
Some gore but its very cartoonish, fantasy-based, non-brutal and avoidable.

Scary good
This game is beautiful in every interaction. I loved how when I played it alone and when my son played it with me. It showed how much we think the same but also showed some differences between us. He liked playing as a more moral character than me. I liked The twist of being more evil(this is always how it’s been in RPGs for me,) we both got different endings to the game. I thought that was really amazing. It really is wonderful how much games have changed in my lifetime. In conclusion this is a great game it may be violent and vulgar at times but it tells a great narrative. I really loved it!

Great game for RPG fans
Awesome game, diverse set of characters. This is a single player and as of writing there is no micro-transactions, which basically means no in game sales for real money.

While this is a game with guns, moderate violence and swearing, that's not the point of the game. The game is basically one big adventure akin to the Fallout series. The world reacts to you depending on how you play, most of the time you can talk your way through most missions without even firing a shot.

The main story is that you're trying to wake some people on a ship, to do that you need some special chemicals. On your journey to get these chemicals you discover some big corporations have taken over and a few groups of people are holding on their freedom. The game also contains a wide assortment of side missions.

If you let your teenager play Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Grand Theft Auto then this is totally fine for them to play.

Well-Crafted RPG for older teens (gore, language, and a drug reference sort of)
I cannot stress how awesome this game is. It is very engaging with incredible gameplay and a layered narrative. However, it does contain some gore, violence, and language. The gore is not too terrible unless the player uses tactical time dilation, which slows time and increases the blood and gore showed during a kill while it is active. Playing without it will limit gore to post-battle carnage, which can also be avoided if the player just doesn't loot the bodies, and the will actually make the game faster paced and more action oriented. The language is not over the top, but you will hear the f word sparsely and read cursing in messages found on various computer consoles found in the world. Though the game doesn't have any real sexual content, there is a character who is interested in dating another character with the same gender, and at one point the ship's computer asks for some "privacy" with the cleaning robot on the ship. There is also a part on a side mission where you inhale a bunch of drugs or something and talk to a guy's dead mother or something, but I wasn't paying attention and the whole section is easy to skip. Overall, the good vastly outweighs the bad, so I would recommend waiting until you are/your kid is, 15 &amp; 1/2 or 16 before playing.

A good rpg
Now I think it is ok for kids 11 If they can handle it, because it can get really violent at times. You can be shooting humans on Terra-2 or Stabbing aliens on Monarch. There is a range of weapons to use. TO wrap this up I think if your kid can handle violence and swearing it is ok.

A Chip off the Old Block
This RPG game is a masterpiece! The game play is extensive and intriguing, the graphics and scenery are beautiful, and it's overall very creative. It teaches good morals and really tests your inner conscience. Who will you help? The rebels that are sick of their lives or the corporations.
Also, the game was created by some of the same people that created the Fallout series so if you love those games, you are guaranteed to like The Outer Worlds. The only thing I think parents should be concerned about is the fact that they use the F-Word about once every 30 minutes.

WoW!!! My favorite Xbox game
I absolutely LOVE this game. There's a lot of things that make this game so great. First of all, there are intense battles, with both humans and animals. Plus, the scenery is beautiful! When you talk to in-game characters, it seems super realistic. The characters have a very sarcastic sense of humor, which will have me cracking up at the most random satire. I know parents are usually paranoid about their kids playing M rated games, but if you're fine with strong language, blood, gore, and a bit of other M rated traits (ex: there's a seemingly friendly family in one part, but you find out that they are cannibals and they try to kill and devour you.) In the game, characters frequently say b***h, f**k, s**t, a**hole, a**, etc. The blood and gore in the game isn't that major. It's not very realistic. You'll often see blood splattered on the ground, and it is usually pink-ish. You will see mangled bodies, both of humans and animals. The blood is more realistic when it is on a body, but if there are splatters it's not realistic. The Outer Worlds is a great first M-rated game. At first, my dad sat down with me and watched me play it. After watching me play for 2 days, he approved of the game and let me play it unsupervised. As for guns, they're mostly sci-fi, and it is really nothing you should hide your kids from. In battles, there's blood splatter, but the game always has this fun, sarcastic, cartoony feeling. It can be a bit dark sometimes,(cannibalism, murder, etc.) Overall it is a great game. It is fun, entertaining, fascinating, beautiful, funny, sarcastic, and about everything in between. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.

The Outer Worlds!
So far, I have loved this game on Xbox One X. Quests are really good and entertaining. In fact I loved it. So Much that for February next year I pre ordered it on Nintendo Switch! A couple of tiny problems. 1. I have to say violence is the main issue with this games brutal, gory, bloody so if your kid is really sensitive to violence then this is a no go. 2. Swearing is heard very frequently meaning very often the game drops f**k , sh*t, and b***ch. Over wise if your child can handle this kind of stuff in The Outer Worlds the this is a must have for any gamer.

Phenomenal Game
U don't care what anyone says, this is the best game I have ever played. The graphics are stunning, and I don't know what common sense media is saying because there are good role models. You can literally just become the hero of the game, rescuing civilians from dangerous people/monsters. The blood might be a little more than expected, but if your kids are mature about it than it should be fine.
