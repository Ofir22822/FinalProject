Great game that kids can play!
Great game, I think you should let your kids play it.

Watch out for in game chat
I absolutely love Overwatch. I have been playing for about a year. The game itself is completely fine, minus a couple of realistic looking guns, a little of blood, and a character that says "die, die, die" in a creepy way. The issue for kids under 12 is the voice chat. There are very "toxic" players in this game, and swear a lot. I have been paired with people who say the f word every 10 seconds. However, there is a way to disable voice chat, and it won't put you at a huge disadvantage. This game teachers great teamwork, but is addicting at times.

Strategy teamwork game
I apreciate the variety of characters with their own abilities and lore. The game mecanics are easy to understand and even though there is a ned to kill enemy players constantly there's not too much violence in it. However the comunity can by toxic sometimes and there are some provocative character models-

"A fun game where violence isn't always the answer"
Like I said in my title, you don't have to use violence to win. There is healing, shields, teleporters, stuff like that. Anyone who says this game is "violent" go get a life. And get Overwatch. Cheers.

I enjoys this Game!
Kaden Cline had this as 10 years old, then Kaden Cline could get this for his Christmas 2018 as 11 years old. Now, I have this. Not so much violence!

Toxic Players
The game content is pretty poor and most players are pretty toxic. Well tbh games with shooters generally have super toxic and salty players.

Good for pre-teens, not so good for 10 and under
I think that it is a good game for older kids, (12 and older) because it s an FPS but it is not as bad as COD. It is more of a friendly FPS because it is not a real life game, it is more a fantasy game, more like Fortnite.

Overwatch
This game is great! If your a gamer then this game is a great addition to your collection. If your a younger kid like me, then its still a great game to get for your birthday or something. It's all about strategy and teamwork. There are also parental controls you can apply to the account, so you wont here any bad words through other teammates. Violence is moderate, weapons are ranged from explosives, guns, swords, bows, and fists. 1 character named McCree smokes a cigar, but that's the only drug explicit in game. When players get hurt, the character may say damn or hell occasionally. Easy to learn. AMAZING game, and is worth your money.

Very good game that promotes teamwork
I have gotten really addicted to Overwatch. It is a multiplayer shooter which follows the story of a team of heroes who defend the planet. The thing I like the most about this game is the emphasis on teamwork which means that it promotes this as well. Another positive is the many heroes and classes to play which makes Overwatch so fun and diverse. It is very fun and only gets boring after a long while. The violence is cartoony and there is no blood or swearing. This is probably the most age appropriate shooter out there.

Good for MATURE teens and adults
This game is amazing if you like shooter games. If you are thinking about buying this game I will give you some tips. So, this game is expensive. It's 59.99 (USD)! But if you are willing to pay for this then keep reading. About the game. This game is rated T for Teen but from the gameplay, it should be rated Everyone 10+. The game has very little blood, its fast passed and cartoony. Also make sure you look at videos of this game too. Lastly the bad part. The reason i say MATURE in the title is because of the Online Interactions. There are many adults that do not care how young your child is and cuss using voice chat. Yes there is a way to turn that off, but if you don't there can be people cussing left and right. This happens on almost ANY online game you play. These people are usually cussing because they are mad that they lost or died. However there are some good people but rarely from what i have seen. Another thing to consider is that if your child does not have a microphone he can not talk to anybody using voice chat. If he does he can talk to random people. So, after all that if you know your child is mature enough for this and you will pay the price then go right ahead and get this game. (I am a gamer myself and have played many games like this)

One of the best Teen rated game I have played.
Overwatch has a great storyline, multiplayer, and characters that you will love. Some might say it looks "cartoonish" but it looks pretty realistic. If you want to have a fun time, this game is for you.

Little Graphic Content
Issues: One character smokes a cigar, few characters when using the default outfit (extremely easy to obtain more outfits) some characters wear revealing clothing, but does not show up in-game frequently, and if playing on computer there is open chat that has little filtering but can be disabled. other that that it has non-realistic violence that focuses on an objective rather than killing.

Good game!
I think overwatch is a really fun game, it’s a lot better than those graphic gun gamer and a good substitute!

There is a character with a rather tight clothes, and a cowboy smoking, but I think a nine year old would understand the right thing to do and stuff.

One bad thing might be is the online interactions, if you don’t want your kid interacting with people online, you can always disable it!

Other than that it’s a great game!

Sorry for any bad grammar/spelling I recently moved from Yemen so I’m still trying my best to get better at English!

Shooting Success!
Overwatch is my most played game on my Xbox one! I don't know how other kids feel about seeing or thinking about blood, now if you are, this isn't your game. If you get shot, smashed, or slammed too much, you'll die or animated blood will show on the border of your screen. Also beware of reaper, for his main line is, "DIE DIE DIE"! But otherwise good game!

I absolutely adore this game! This is one of my favorite video games of all time. For what reason? I haven't a clue! There's something about it that's so enjoyable that I keep coming back for more. However, there are a few concerns I have about this video game that could be helpful for you in deciding whether your child should play or not.
First off, there is a LOT of toxic people in this game. I think it's gone down quite a lot, but it's crazy how rude so many players are. It ranges from snarky remarks to incredibly sexist comments. What I recommend to avoid torment is by staying out of voice chat and keeping personal information out of chat (Like your age, gender, etc). I also never enter the voice chat channel, so I won't hear what others are saying.
Despite what Common Sense Media says, there IS swearing present in this video game. Of course players will sometimes use strong language, however, there is a profanity filter to keep it from showing up in chat. But most of the Overwatch characters actually swear. When a player receives an item called "Orb of Discord", they will yell, "Damn!" One of the characters, Genji, on top of saying, "Damn!" will also say, "Kuso!" which is Japanese for "shit." Soldier: 76 &amp; McCree (Most likely more I don't know about) also say "damn" in an unlock-able voice line.
Those, I believe, are the only things that really concern me that Common Sense Media didn't mention. But this is a really enjoyable game and I recommend it!

Very good!
I got this game for my birthday and was very excited to play it. As soon as I started playing it, I loved it! I play on Xbox one and it is probably the best game I've ever played, crossing with Fortnite. It is not gruesome and when somebody dies, they simply fall to the ground. I would recommend age 11 and over because it is a violent game, I'm not going to lie. The best thing I can recommend for parents is to let their kids only play it a couple of days a week. Some characters could scare younger children if they are like 7 year olds because some characters have weird voices and can look slightly scary. I would totally recommend this game for pre-teens/teens but you must know that if you have a head set or a microphone people are able to speak to you and even if you don't you can still hear them talking. Just don't reveal private info and you will be fine! This game can teach you about team-work. The guns aren't violent looking but look very futuristic, that is the base of the game, looking like the future

Great game for 11 year old's and up
Overwatch is a great game for people just getting into first person shooters (fps games). I think this game puts out a really good message that you can do anything if you work as a team! The game does not have any gore at all, but you do have to shoot people but with thing from bows to ninja stars etc. Even though this game has violence it is very cartoony so it should be fine for anyone age 11 and up!

Great videogame
For a start, it's an amazing game. But there's blood. Not exactly but you see a puff of red when you hit somebody. Plus, there's red around your screen when your at low health. Apart from that the game itself is awesome. You just gotta be quick when choosing characters or heroes as there can only 1 hero in each game. It's available on pc ps4 and Xbox but is pretty costly.

quick play is perfect for kids, while competitive may be for the older more experienced players
cartoonish realistic violence makes this game very kid friendly, also the fact that its easy to learn how to play, although, i think that the competitive side of it makes it less so and brings out the competitive nature in children.
Moving on to the lore, the game has great role models as one character is a lesbian, another character is a really strong woman and a peaceful robot healer/monk
overall, i believe this is a great game with great role models and ease of play
