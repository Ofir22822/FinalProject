A Classic!
This has been a defining game of the 21st century. While the game didn't blow up quite as much as Fortnite, I has been able to maintain its high popularity for 4 years. Overwatch is a team based FPS with an open mic. Before you join a server, you pick what type of player you can choose when you enter the match (attacker, tank, or healer). When you enter a game, you select your character of choice from the options given to your class. There are several game modes, but most of them fall under these categories: king of the hill, escort the payload, and team deathmatch. The violence isn't bad in the slightest, when players die they disappear and there is no blood or gore when a player gets hurt. The reason I rated the age for 11 and up is because of the hot mic. It is open voice chat, like if you've ever played teams in fortnite, and people can pretty much say anything they want to. This could scar some younger children for life, so I recommend turning off the microphone feature and muting other players if you are a parent of a younger child. But other than that, it is a very good game that has so many different character options that it is hard to dislike the game.

Amazing Game, Not Bad At All
This game is great, has a very small amount of blood or anything very bad. CSM has too many parent ratings, so every game that is rated Teen is always for like 37 year olds. Overwatch has tons of great characters, and doesn't really make you buy anything in game. It has merch, yes, do do most video games. There is no profanity or drugs whatsoever, and no I don't think a smoking cowboy is drugs. Another great thing about Overwatch, is just the huge amounts of people that play, so it's also a great way to make online friends(if you do that). The chat on games has never been a problem in my life, most gamers don't bother typing in the chat a lot of the time. Overall, I think Overwatch is a good game, and people should be less harsh.

Very good.
The game has a bit of violence, including small splatters of blood, and revealing costumes. Good game.

Super fun game.
The graphics of this game are phenomenal, exceeding Fortnite, Apex, and most other games in its category. A lot of people on here are saying higher age ratings because it is online and people can talk to you. However, you don’t have to be on game chat( where you can talk to other people) There is very little blood and is very cartoony. The controls are pretty easy once you play around with it for around an hour or so.

Overwatch is ok
overwatch is a very good game and i thint it is suitible for children 10+, but if your child is under 12 i reccomend turning in game chat off because there are alot of toxic players who seem to have no limit to the things they say, and the custom games and group finder can also have offensive or obscene titles and also be filled with horny roleplayers. The quickplay and arcade modes are just perfect if your child is under 12 because it is safe just as long as game chat is off, other than that the game is very entertaining and fun, its just the community surrounding it that is bad, and i'm also cherry picking details, it really isn't that bad.

Very good, but watch out for the toxicity
Overwatch is a great game, there is teamwork, it is positive,
and it is fun, but you have to be careful about the toxic and mean players. Like many other games, Overwatch has a voice chat option
Many people will talk and every once in a while someone will pick up their mic and start to talk. 90% of the time those people won’t say anything mean, bad or toxic, but sometimes, someone will be mean,
swear or be toxic. The players can be mean because they died, someone wasn’t being helpful, someone wasn’t good at their character the we’re playing or there team lost. Sometimes these players might leave the game in rage, people refer to people who do this as Rage Quitters. This does make sense because overwatch can be very infuriating but why leave and leave your team at a disadvantage? If too many players leave the match, the match will be cancelled and all the remaining players will be kicked out so why do it?

My favorite game of all time
I play on a daily basis and have over 200 hours in game. There is about as much violence as a lego game, you shoot someone and when they die they fall down and disappear just like playing lego star wars. There is an occasional D*mn when a negative affect is placed on you but it is often in a another language. The game itself promotes team work because if you do not work as a team you cannot push a payload or control a point. It a very high quality game especially for the price compared to games like fortnite which will likely cost you a lot more in the long run overwatch is a one time purchase. If you want to know about sexual content there is a character with some cleavage shown but the game is in first person so if you do play widowmaker you cannot see anything and if equip a new skin you cannot see anything. Tracer also has a skin tight suit but you see more sexual outfits on the street. Overwatch is a game you can work together with your family and friends it is a great bonding opportunity and a very light T and way closer to a E 10+.

Mild violence, distracting rating
Of corse it is a fighting game, but it has as much violence as Fortnite (RIP). One character is smoking a cigar in the name of drugs. Their is no Sex, I have no idea why that is in the rating. But it requires Nintendo online if your playing on Switch.

Overwatch = perfect mix of sci-fi and fantasy
I've been playing this game for 2 years and I have not seen anything that makes this game too inappropriate. Some characters ex.( Widowmaker, Mercy, symmetra) wear revealing and tight suits but no actual nudity is meant in any sexual way. Language never goes far beyond the only word dam* and if you would like to be aware voice lines can be purchased and one of them is the dam* word but its in a different language so no one really feels offended if you speak English. As far as violence gets like the real world shotguns are depicted with a character called reaper but They sound unrealistic. Also occasionally in a game if you use melee like a punch blood will be shown but again very unrealistic. As the game quickly unfolds to players teamwork and cooperation seem the only way to win. Online players these days aren't very toxic anymore. I haven't been in many games where the foul- mouthed adult will say much. Mostly kids will be in the chat and if language does occur just mute them in social settings. So that way the fun goes on. I recommend this game to anyone who loves action and sci fi and playing with friends. In game purchases make your account better so just know this before any purchased come at surprising moments. One of the best games ever. Hope you enjoy!!!

Overwatch Review
should be 'e' for everyone I don't know why common sense media rates it as 14+. Plus the open mic can be disabled so people on your child's team can't hear your child and your child can't hear them when that feature is enabled.

Comms
Absolutely wonderful game that is still going strong after four years of release. The only downside to this game is the comms. As other reviews have said, they can be turned off, but because of that you will never know when to push or if anyone is flanking from behind. They are absolutely necessary if you want to succeed in this game. A good thing is that you can individually mute players so if someone isn't contributing and just spouting trash about you can mute them.

One of my favorite games!
Overwatch is a great game, with great characters. I've loved the game ever since I got it, and even though I'm not very good at it, I play it for hours. It takes place in the future, so the guns aren't based off of any real guns, and you can barely see any blood, and even when you do it looks fake. The violence isn't a lot, and the characters are heroes who try to defeat evil. It's a great and fun game, and I prefer it for 8 and up.

Great Game!
Having invested hundreds of hours in the game, I can honestly say it is a fantastic game. There is minimal to no blood(and even then it’s sometimes blue), no sexual situations, and pretty much no swearing (aside from a Wild West characters optional voice line that includes the word ‘h-ll’). The game is only online 6v6 multiplayer, so if you don’t feel comfortable with your child playing online sadly there is no offline. You can disable game chat though so your child wouldn’t be able to talk to their team. Overwatch is a strategic, team building, cooperative game with a competitive side, and is for sure my favorite game. 20/10

Great game
The game I will be reviewing today is Overwatch, a first person shooter game made by Blizzard. In this game it is a 6 vs 6 in a random map, there 31 unique characters you can play as. There are 3 modes, payload where a cart needs to be escorted, capture point where there are 2 points you need to claim/defend, and finally control point where there is 1 point and you have to control it for a set amount of time.

This game’s cost varies, I bought it when it costed $60 back in 2017. Now it cost $20 for classic $40 for origins and $60 for legendary, the more costly versions just give you more cosmetics but is the same game, and are not worth the extra money. The game has a wide player base, and lots of people spend hours upon hours on this game. Some characters take no skill to play but wreck everyone like Baston, Mei, Torbjörn, Sombra, Symetra, Reaper, Widowmaker, Sigma, Moria and Baptist.


Overall I think overwatch is a great game and you can play on computers or on consoles. You can connect with people from any device and you get the same exact match. It is a great game and now only the low cost of $20. When overwatch 2 was announced I read about it for a while and it can still play with people from overwatch 1 on the same server, speed, and gameplay.
9/10 would recommend.

Overwatch=good
This is probably one of the best games of all time. There is no sex, if you don’t give your kid a mic, then he/she can’t talk to other people. McCree, a cowboy character does occasionally have a cigar in his mouth, but he never vocally promotes it. Some of the characters Occasionally say the words “dammit” or “what the hell”, but i play this game a lot and have only heard it a couple of times. As for the “blood” when you are on really low health a red ring appears on the edges of your screen to notify you that your on low health and the blood is nonexistent if no one had told me there was blood I honestly would have never noticed. Most of the characters are not only heroes, but promote heroism. One of the characters is literally a hamster in a giant robot hamster ball. A couple of the hero’s are lgbt. This game is so much more kid friendly then call of duty or any other famously violent game. This game promotes team based skills, helps reaction times. Before I mentioned some of the characters are heroes, for example Winston, a genetically modified super smart gorilla. But some of them are bad. For example Roadhog and Junkrat, two Australian guys who went mad after the Omnic crisis in Australia. Most of the gun are not real life guns. I think only 2 out of the 31 heroes have realistic guns, and ones a sniper and the other is a soilder. That’s probably why they are realistic. Most of the characters are scientists who created weapons life Moira who can shoot beams that heal friendly players, or Zenyatta a philosophical robot that can shoot magic orbs that can help friendly players or worsen enemy players. If your kid asks for this she/he is probably old enough to play it. This is one of the best team based games of all time.

Great, fun, simple. PG violence. 12+ for voice chat.
A simple shooter game. Very little blood. While sure, the characters may be revealing, kids wont understand it unless they are old enough. There is voice chat, which is almost required to play competive, but it can be turned off, and I would not reccomend having it on unless your child is 12+. A very simple shooter game for most ages!
