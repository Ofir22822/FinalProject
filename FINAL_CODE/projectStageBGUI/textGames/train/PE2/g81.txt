Best game ever
I do warn you, there are a lot of feminist in this game, big big butts and some people fantasize the characters and I do not recommend searching them, TOO MANY INAPPROPRIATE language speaking and screaming or screeching and the worst part is that kids are swearing and screaming for unknown reasons because their team is bad. I recommend reporting them immediately if you do not like them screaming at you also mute them and don't tell them you reported them for that kind of behaviour otherwise they'll salt report you back but the game itself did something about it to stop those kind of abuse but and some people hates everything here and the game is sometimes full of hackers with protesting. If you're gonna buy the game then be sure to be alert by my message who is gonna buy the game.

The game is #1 unique. Has good background and graphics, great gameplay, nice storyline, nice pvp mode and custom mode created by players and the game is challenging, and a good distraction if you have nothing to do and for your children to enjoy a videogame so they can leave you alone or if they have nothing to do or if they did a good job on something.

Strong messages are wars and stuff like starwars but will never happen. The characters are sexualized but younger players will never notice, easy to play, too much violence and children might think that explosions, guns and other weapons that can kill you does not kill you in real life, too many fantasizing and otherwise called sexualizing, the online players swears, if you loved the game then you're gonna be one of those people who collects Overwatch items and stuff, the hero named "McCree" always smokes cigarette and the characters will sometimes speak like they've been drinking too much except the 19 year old "D.Va", Tracer, Winston and the omnics heroes, and people should read the rules and regulations before playing this to not get banned also some people will sneak into your Overwatch account also blizzard etc and will spam you invites unless you block them and then message you mean, mean things after a match is over and you still have to block them ingame and your ps4/blizzard account to prevent them from harassing you.

Overwatch is a great game overall - but if you are a parent worried about too much violence or something, you don't have to worry! This game has almost no blood at all. (Except for a little bit comes out when you hit someone.) Mostly, it's all about saving the world and building up your reputation as heroes. If I was a parent, I would only worry about my child's safety. There is team voice communication but, for Xbox users you can disable it in the Overwatch menus or on the Xbox account itself. I'm not sure about PlayStation

great game
this game has to be one of the best iv'e ever played with more than 20 characters and so many cool maps. there is blood in the game but its very dificult to notice while playing. there are some characters that do look a bit innapropriate but the only one that goes over the top is a character call widowmaker. there is online interactivity which means there will be people swearing but there is a way to fix this just turn you're volume down when you're in a game when someone is using a mic. there is only one drug use part really and thats a cigar that a character called mcree smokes but it really dosen't matter that much.

Great Shooter for young kids!
This is a great shooter for your kids who want something such as Call of Duty but you will not allow them. No Blood or Limbs coming off or anything like that but there is an unmoderated chat, especially for PC so what your kids will hear will not always be the best. Other than that, it is a Colorful shooter for young kids especially

If your kid is mature
The game is slightly violent but it's cartoonish and unrealistic, I'd say if your kid is mature enough and at least 9 years old buy it for them. However keep in mind it's and addicting game so they might get somewhat obsessed with it.

Awesome Shooter With Little To No Violence.
It's pretty fun to play the arcade modes and play quick play. Overall in this game, there isn't really much to cover apart from it being a really fun shooter with no blood, gore etc. There is online microphone use, which can be muted, but people can say swear words and other things on their mic; the most commonly known thing I've heard people say to others in their mic is that they are terrible at the game etc., but overall great shooter. It can be played anywhere from 9 and up if your kid is mature enough to mute people who try to talk bad about them.

Great shooter with some minor things to worry about
great game IMO things to worry about though: there is very little blood when you get a good shot on other players but there is no gore, i recommend you child to be 14+ for voice chat as there is a lot of swearing, there is very little smoking but is fine, also do not be surprised if your kid is coming to you to ask you for loot boxes.

Likely the most kid friendly shooter game.
Overwatch is one of the best games I have ever played. I rate this game 10+ because of the lack of blood, profanity, etc (basically anything a parent would worry about). Though one character, Widowmaker, wears a revealing outfit, and McCree is always shown smoking, they don't effect the game in any way, except for some dialogue about McCree's smoking habits. There is a minuscule amount of profanity. The only "bad" thing any of them say is "damn" but it's always in another language, form what I have heard.
There is voice chat in Overwatch. You can turn it off, however, it is essential to winning matches, for Overwatch is a team based game. Players can be very toxic, especially in competitive, and often threaten to false-report, and tell people to "kys" if they're doing bad. This has happened to me several times, because I am very terrible at this game, and get accused for "trolling" often.
Overall, this game is no worse than something like Minecraft or Terraria. Overwatch promotes heroism, and doing the right thing, and I would suggest this to mature children.

gets stale after a while
the whole game is based off of killing characters on the opposite team.

My favorite first person shooter.
Some of the characters have inspiring backstories like Lucio, but other characters are criminals. Overall there is little blood and little swearing. And the blood is a just quick flash of red. Since the blood is just a quick flash of red, younger kids can play it if red doesn't bother them. It is easy to play and super fun. The graphic are really good. Overall it is just a great game.

Overwatch... not that bad!
Some people say, 2+. NO VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER!!! Some people say, 16+. TOO VIOLENT!!! SHOULD BE M!!! TOXIC PLAYERS!!! DON't BUY!!! I think that if you merged these reviews, then this is what Overwatch is. It is not very violent. The only blood is a red splash when someone dies, and the players fall down and then re spawn when killed, similar to Minecraft. There are objectives, and the players usually aren't toxic at all. If there was an E-11+ rating, I would slip Overwatch under that category. It is not really an E-10 game, but I would say it is completely OK for Ages 10 and up. One of the problems with this game is that you need a really good computer to run it. I have a Dell XPS 15 9560 with a GTX 1050 and an Intel Core I5, and I still have to use medium graphics (Probably cause of 8GB ram.) Great game, however. Most of the characters are great role models, fighting for their countries or whatnot. Some of the only non-good role models are for example, The Reaper, who just says "die" and stuff like that, and is portrayed is a terrorist. That is the worst, though. There is no wonder how it won Game of The Year in 2016. Be careful with the consumerism, however, with any big game like this one there is lots.

Honestly....
You might think it's violent,but it's just as violent as a pg-rated marvel movie. There isn't strong suggestive themes which parents have to worry about.

Frequent mild cartoony violence , ok for 11+
This game has low violence that is mostly cartoony, there is little to no blood and the only thing close to a swear word is "damn" which I've only heard four times after 49 hours of playing this game, you can also mute in game voice chat so your younger kids don't have to hear people swear or say inappropriate jokes. Overall this game is excellent and if your worried this is too violent for your child its not, just talk to them about the game after they play it and about the difference with video games and real life.
