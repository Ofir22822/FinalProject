Such a good game I have it on my switch I love it no violence or Drugs or anything bad really. Awesome game but I suggest 6+ not because it's bad just because it is a little hard to play.

Stinky and pay to win.
I love the gameplay and all game modes. what ruins it for me is the pay to win. It is so bad. if you love basketball feel free to get this game. Just be prepared to get your cheeks clapped by rich bois that spend hundreds of dollars to get more and more and more.

2K Review
So I don’t think anything is wrong with this game at all but here are some info.

There are brands like Air Jordan’s , Nike, and Gatorade in this game. But I’ll be honest, who cares.

There isn’t anything bad in this game besides of some uses of d-mn in my career.

But here is something I should point out. Beware of searching images on 2k. Because you might see stuff you don’t want little kids seeing, trust me.

A good game, but VC limits the fun
I like this game and all, but they really need to stop with the VC, you have to pay not 50 cents, not 5 dollars, not 10, not 50, but 100 DOLLARS for virtual money! why would I pay real money just for a Virtual pixelated Galaxy Opal Lebron James card on MyTeam? You need PS Plus or Xbox Live Gold (PS plus for me) to play on park (Squad, Cages, Pro Am, REC center, Ante Up, etc.) only to lose a game to a bunch of people with ugly faces and stupid googly glasses, and its all Ronnie 2k's fault too. And be careful in parks because the chat is unmoderated and people can just say cuss words, not like I care though.

Great!
This game is a HUGE step up from 2k19 and a great game overall. Only thing putting it at a 4 is the microtransactions in which they are a little excessive.

Good For Sport Fans
It's a great game if you like sports, especially basketball, it is pay to win, even though you get paid, but you get paid poorly. The game has some glitches, like the jerseys getting distorted on the players in the lineup
introductions.

Great Basketball Experience
NBA 2K20 is what you expect. A basic fun game whether you play with friends or not. There are different gamemodes to choose from such as MyTeam (unlock your favorite NBA players and put them on a team together). And MyCarrer (create your own character and go through a narrative as you improve your character). My only problem with this game is there micro transactions. It's far too similar to gambling, and ruins the experience for those who don't pay money for a game they already paid for. No violence, sex, drugs, and hardly any language. All ages game.

What you should know about NBA2K20
I got this game a few weeks ago, and it's one of my favorite games i've played. But a warning before you consider getting it, it is very addicting, and you, or your kid might not be able to stop playing. Maybe it was just for me, but they keep you wanting to play one more games, game after game after game. Otherwise, it is a great game that I highly recommend getting. It is rather hard to play, due to learning all the controls and buttons to push at the right time. But with some getting used to the controls, you'll have a blast playing it, with your friends, or by yourself. There is online play, and if you don't want your kid playing online, than there is lots of other options to play. You can be a team manager, and make decisions for your team, or build your own team of players, then using them on the court. Or there is a my career mode, where you create your own character, then use him in a story line created by the game, and make decisions along the way while playing as him. No violence, inappropriate stuff, or bad language is imputed into the game, I'm not sure if other online players can talk to you, but not playing online there is nothing bad to worry about. I highly suggest this game for kids 8 and up due to the skill level to play, and the adult like content.

Fun game but has language
It's really a fun game, easy to start and challenging to get good at. The gameplay is good, and a lot of though is giving into rating players. The story mode is emotional and deep, and tells the story of your player. Watch out, though, as dialogue contains language such as hell, d*mn, and Jes*s. Additionally language comes in background hip-hop music which is unedited, mostly language that I have already mentioned and sh*t. There is gambling, but no one is actually going to play it including your kids.

Perfect for anyone
This game is literally just basketball and if you think that a child who is any where from 6-10 shouldn’t play it, than you probably shouldn’t let them play basketball in real life.

A fun game for basketball lovers
The gambling is only if you're really into it, and its hard to find. But my little brother loves this game and its a great bonding time too.

Simulated gambling and stole my 2 brothers
So this game stole my brothers, and now this is the only game they play on their PS4 (along with Horizon, for 1 brother and Fifa 20 for the other). There is limitless simulated gambling. I have rated it not for kids but it should be not for anyone.

Game contains real gambling
This game encourages players to spend real money on gambling to recieve i-game intems. Avoid this game at all costs! Do not support this game or EA will continue to put these gambling mechanics in their games.
