Great!
So awesome! Some violence used and some open chat but it's great! IK McCree smokes a cigar but he's a positive character.

This game is fine
There is nothing wrong with this game except for violence. It is completely unrealistic and about as bad as fortnite. I haven’t seen any revealing outfits yet. As long as you have chat off, this is a kid friendly game.

There's not really any drugs or sex (Except for McCree who holds a cigar)

The most family friendly and better than Call of Duty

WOW VIOLENCE
What an evil Satan game, no kids should ever touch this trash heap. I mean what theheck it has guns!!!!!1. This is why World War III is going to happen. Teaching kids to kill others is just degrading our society. Not to mention the endless bugs they add in disguised as ‘DLC,’ whatever that is. My kids are way more classed than this dump.

The best game ever!
I have this game and I play it alot. Overwatch is a multiplayer game that you fight each other in battles of 6v6. The only 2 things you need to know is That some heroes in the game like Reaper say D-mn! when someone is attacking him. The second reason is that widowmaker wears a suit that shows her bo-bs. I hoped this helped you. : )

great game
some characters have reveling or tight clothing but nothing graphic.
one character smokes a cigar.
when a character is shot there's little to no blood shown.
occasionally characters might say "damn" if they get hit.
most characters show good role models.
some mature 8 year olds could be allowed to play.

Most PC shooter you'll find
This game is great. I got it when I was like 12 or 13 I think and I've been playing it since. It promotes teamplay and cooperation, and the underlying theme behind all of the heroes' reasons for fighting is to "protect the innocent," as one character even says. Overwatch is a 6 v 6 teambased first person shooter where the goal is to capture an opjective, not just to slaughter the other team. The controls are easy to get the hang of, but some characters are significantly more difficult to master for younger players. Younger children should be wary of the voice chat in competitive matches, where swearing and other toxicity lurk. However, there is always the option of turning it off. Great first shooter for new gamers!

Not that bad.
This game is very fun and unique. As far as blood, there's very little and its very unnoticeable. Cursing is nothing more than c*ap or d*mn and its not overused. One of the things that makes this game so cool is the characters. They each have their own abilities that make them different from others, and it lets players find a character that's right for them. Most of these characters are great role models, and are against crime and fight for good. It might teach teach kids that sometimes, you have to risk your own life for someone else. For example: in one of the characters backstories (Tracer) an innocent person is about to get assassinated. Tracer notices the sniper on top of a building and jumps in front of the bullet. After a long battle to stop the assassin, a young girl nearby witnesses the battle and is inspired by the brave act that she took. This game is a great game and I feel like its a good one to start out with if your kid wants a shooter game.

I've had this game almost since release and they have just made it better and better. Great starting point for unsure parents about FPS games.

Never gets old
Overwatch is a great game and in my opinion has no aspects that a parent wants their child to avoid. The style of the game is cartoony and it includes no blood whatsoever except for when you are on very low health and a red outline appears on your screen. There are multiple characters to choose from and you start with them all at the beginning of the game. Each has exclusive abilities and appearances. The only reason I am rating it a 10 plus is because it is an online game and there are options to message and voice chat. Even grown ups will find this game amusing as you can either play it simply or look at it as a strategic, team based game. You can play a death match (all V all)

Very experienced with this game
Played this game for 8 months and can tell you that the age rating is spot on the box or if a mature 10-11 year old could also play. Violence is very cartoon and no blood or gore. Sexual characters is only one but you can purchase a skin for 1000 credits to get rid of the cleverage so recommend doing that but a big factor was that I spent 80 euro on dlc in this game buying loot boxes so don’t buy dlc. Swearing is almost non igsisint but when a character Called zenatta puts his damage orb on a character the use the word damn other than that no swearing. This game has lots of positive messages and role models because some of the voice lines can be very incouraging. Competitive mode: Overwatvh has a very triggering competitive mode where u are expected to try hard or try your best which can result in destructin of property or your child might get very angry. Another thing is voice chat voice chat is where you talk to strangers in ur game this can be bad because the use of language can be a very strong issue so don’t let them join voice chat. Talking to your friends while playing though is one of the funniest times in my life “mending “ with your friends is hilarious. 100 percent worth buying just think if ur child is able or mature anough to play it. Have fun and stay safe

Not as good as the ads made it sound like
Huge disappointment when it was suddenly just a dull and boring game instead of a ground-breaking, mind-blowing game that I was expecting. it was just a game with boring gameplay. At least this is still better than TF2 or Cs--Go

Ok for younger kids
This Game is good for kids 9 and up, just make sure you go to the settings for the game, select audio, and turn off the voice chat. Mainly in Competitive mode, (but this can happen in all modes) there is lots of people screaming swear words at each other on voice chat. Some say that In game modes like Competitive you need voice chat, but i'm a Diamond Ranked player (a little over mid teir) who never uses voice chat and I do just fine. This game has a little bit of blood that splatters when you attack, but it is a very small amount of blood that often goes unnoticed. As long as you have your kid turn off voice chat, the game should be fine for your kid.
