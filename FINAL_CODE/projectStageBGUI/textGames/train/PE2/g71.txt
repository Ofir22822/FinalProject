Bad
The game is not worth the money or time that people put into it. With every single update that is released it just gets worse and honestly the game is dead, it is also full of toxic players, so I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have a positive experience.

It's hands down the worse game ever. How do you say matchmaking is great when I'm getting into bronze games with diamond not to mention they can't stop nefting /buffing people is so annoying to see that your main does less damage every day or the dps heros lazer you if you don't have a shield, they also neft the shields so killing enemies is 10x harder now don't brother playing a game that your only gonna play for 2 days then quit because the amount of low level booster that keep on killing you tea baging etc also the fans are toxic as hell so good luck finding a player who doesn't say the n word of f word every 5 seconds.
horrible gift won't not recommended

no monitoring at all
it is a common problem that really good players create fake accounts as low level players and then enter the game and demolish beginners.
also behavior on online chat is shocking. they need better monitoring without a doubt.

Great game modes to try
Overwatch is now my favorite game. It has a lot of game modes and I can't be boring by playing them. In some events or anniversaries, they also published new games and some of them are based on the story of Overwatch. I can't wait till next year to try more new games in Overwatch 2.
My two favorite game is "Mystery Heroes" and the new game mode published in 2019 " Hero Gauntlet" because I was allowed to try others heros but won't be blame playing them badly for the reason that the hero was randomly chosen.
Great shooting game for main support like me

Violence is suitable for a 7 year old, but the online chat mode makes it more mature.
Overwatch is a really fun game and with minimal violence most kids will want to play it. However the main issue with this is that the game is only multiplayer, and because of this, the player will (probably) be autimaticlly set to be able to chat with random strangers. Now this can be turned of in the settings, but it can still be easily turned back on. Apart from that being the main issue, there isnt really much else in the game that would make it inappropriate for kids, however there is some issues with mild violence where players go 1st person playing as a fantasy character trying to kill the other players, however its very unrealistic and if it were a movie it would most likley be rated PG. Apart from this Overwatch is very fun game which all ages will enjoy.

Its good exept for one major problem
The only problem i have with this is open chat so be sure your child is not gullible enough to fall for any scams and is able to deal with heated situations cooly

Other than that the characters are great. There is a lot of diversity in the roster ranging from A fully armored, hammer wielding german to a VERY perky time shifting British young lady

Good But Toxic
This is a pretty well made game with really cool characters. It's very diverse featuring characters of many different backgrounds from all over the world working together. There are very strong female characters and a LGBTQ+ presence. It is a first person shooter game based around protecting objectives in teams, however there is a very toxic fanbase. I would recommend that you have a tough skin and be able to put up with needless bullying from people in the game, and able to calmly handle it. You can ignore the chat and not participate, but people still kind of suck. It is also rather unbalanced and can be a bit infuriating. And if your child plays the character Mercy a lot, they are going to become severely tired and upset. 'Mercy Mains' feel a lot of pain.

Devs don't care at all
The developers at blizzard did a fine job advertising and selling this game but now they are not adding anything new so far. This is an amazing game but they need to add something new.

Appropriate, Fun Game
I have been playing this game going on 2 years now and it is a fantastic game that promotes team play and cooperation. There is no gore and very little blood with no offensive language present in the game. Players can choose interact with random people who are on their team by joining game chat, and other players can sometimes use offensive language and/or be extremely insulting. There is an “avoid as teammate” option for players who you found offensive, rude, and/or insulting.

classic shooter
Some smoking and alcohol references are evident. The gun toting character Mcree smokes too many cigars I am surprised he never gets ill! The maps are littered with empty beer and wine bottles.
Violence is the main component but there is no realistic blood or guts to speak of and so if the smoking and alcohol references are acceptable then this game is suitable for ages 9 and upwards.
Voice chat is available but can be disabled.

Solid, mostly clean FPS. Almost all of the story and positive messages comes from online media.
As far as first person shooters go, Overwatch isn't very intense, with only mild (but common) violence, and some sexualized character designs. The games' story is told through free online short animations and comics, so any positive or negative messages or themes are expressed outside of the actual game.

Violence: Players use all sorts of firearms to dispatch each other, but no actual gun brands are used. Instead, most weapons are futuristic laser guns. That being said, some characters still use bullets, and there are even a few melee weapons, like maces and swords. successful attacks are highlighted by small splashes of blood. The most violent imagery in the game comes from the use of a bow and arrow, as the arrows will imbued themselves in the enemy's body, and stay there, leading to some slightly grisly images, such as an arrow sticking out of a corpse's head.

Sexuality: Some female characters wear revealing or tight fitting clothing.

Positive messages/role models: The game's multinational cast is very diverse, with many races and both genders being represented by heroic figures. The cast also includes several homosexual characters. The online story generally teaches tolerance and promotes selflessness, with the main conflict centering around the struggle of a race of self aware robots to be considered equal to humans. (Paralleling racial struggles in real life.)

language: Mild cusses like "H**l" "D**m" "B*****d" are occasionally spoken by the characters. Players can use some mild swears in the text chat, but the heftier curses will be censored into asterisks (unless this feature is disabled in the options.) Still, there is nothing stopping players from using inappropriate language in voice chat.

Consumerism: Players receive cosmetic items indirectly through "loot boxes" which are unlocked by playing the game for a certain amount of time, and will give the player four random items when opened. Alternatively, the player can buy them with real money, and there is still no guarantee they will get the item they wanted.

tobacco use: One character is constantly smoking a cigar.

The gameplay is just pristine
The game play in the video review does not justify how violent this game is l. It encourages team play and shorting people in order to kill them . Some of the voice lines characters say are very inspiring. When I bought this game for my kid I said “Scoot your butt over let me try!” That  ... continue reading

Please read this review
I rated this game 11+ for violence and bad language, violence 3/5 when you kill human players there is a small chance you could see some blood, this game allows you to use a variety of weapons to kill enemy players, bows guns, swords, rocket launchers, hammers and lasers, though the game is cartoony.
Bad language 4/5 you can speak in game chat, leaving you vulnerable to bad language, though this can be turned off in settings.
Please don't be like other parents and buy your 5 yr old this game.

Absolutely unmoderated chat.
This game itself is likely appropriate for 8+, but the online community surrounding this game absolutely skews young adult (18-35). Due to the demographic of the players, there is ubiquitous swearing and pointed insults (including threats referencing gender-violence, racial slurs, and homophobic rants) etc. The language in this game from the players is at least as bad as anything you'd hear in some of the most profanity-laced R-rated movies out there (as in at least 10% of chat is likely active swearing). If you would not feel comfortable with your children hearing recordings at raucous college parties, I would not allow them free access to this game, as open vioce and type chat are one keystroke away, and most teams will specifically want players to have mics and be talking throughout the games.

I have played this game for 1000s of hours. It is extremely fun and I would encourage any adult who enjoys first person shooter games to try it out, however, parents should keep in mind that it is not in anyway an emotionally safe community for children, and even sensitive young teens may find the bully-nature of many of the toxic members of the community too much to handle.

Another issue any online game with unmoderated chat is the linking to external chat sites (such as discord) which operate as unmoderated online communities where kids can be even more vulnerable to adults online. We have a few older teens in the discord I frequent and it always makes me wonder if their parents know they are spending time in online spaces full of adults. I have met many online friends, but for children and teens it would just be incredibly easy for predators to meet, groom, and access children through these games. I would not recommend allowing children or young teens to play unless you are actively playing with them and can hear and see what is going on in chat.

Great game!
The game can be a little violent, but it's still a great game. Kids enjoy it and adults enjoy it. The characters a creative and strange. The game is great and I really like playing it.

Like tf2 for younger kids
I don’t really hate this game, but I don’t like it either.. it’s a lot like team fortress two (which is more mature) it’s a team shooter where each player chooses a class to play each round, the game has many game modes, key modes are capture point and payload. Capture point is where you capture points and advance.. payload is where you escort a cart to different areas till you reach the end. If your kid want to play this, before dropping money on it I highly advise to have a round on TeamFortress 2 (even if you test it first!) as it’s what overwatch is based on, and it’s free!

I cant believe these reviews are true
I bought this recently to try before letting the kids play (they are both 13) it as its an online only game I wanted to check what the gaming community was like and how the game was managed.

I played a couple match's most days for about a week or two and encountered various forms of racism / hate speech /bullying among other awful behavior. It was about 50/50 chance of a match ending badly with people screaming, arguing or insulting each other.

I contacted the company Blizzard several times about various players that had acted in such a way to see how they are dealt with as I was placed in another game a few times with the same players. Sadly all I received was an automated response each time for the company. I friended one abusive player to see how long it took him to be banned for racist slurs etc he was still playing after several reports and emails to the company as where other players.

I would not let anyone under 16 years old play this at the minimum, there is far to much abusive /racist and toxic players for kids to have a good time. Alot of angry adults play this game to vent steam.

There is also a vast amount of players with several accounts - which the company knows about - so they have no real threat of being banned or removed from the game, which allows them to continue to be abusive etc.

The company seems to have left the game to run itself with automated programs for reporting players etc

I thankfully bought the game through PayPal as i was aware the company doesn't give refunds so i managed to get my money back that way.

I have also noted the in game loot box's are being banned in several countries due to encouraging gambling behavior in children.

Do not buy this game for your kids. If your 16+ at least then go ahead jump in the cesspool of subhuman filth you will meet in this game. Absolutely shocking community.
