There is an option to turn off kill am in single player
Ok for every parent who doesn't let your 12 year old play sniper elite because of the kill cam that is just stupid and they don't ever swear I've played the game campaign like 36 times and never heard swearing and there is a option called off blood and turn the chance of the kill am happening by turning it all the way down

Turn off the kill cam
This game is great. It is for kids when they turn off the killcam. The killcam is the only thing that makes this game inappropriate. Other than that it is for children 8 and up.

Brilliant chaotic fun
I love the sniper elite series-and so do my kids. At first, I was a bit sceptical introducing them to this controversial series and I understand the concerns of fellow parents. However, the only prominent issue in this game is the x ray kill cam. While pretty bloody, gore isn't actually present. No limbs go flying, only shards of bone and-what honestly looks like- the deflation of vital organs. If these are a major concern or do still seem worrying, they can be disabled meaning the game has next to no really violent features. Unlike most in this genre, it has a T rating as while there is violence, it's minimal and quite infrequent. Dark themes, swearing, etc aren't really present at all here so no worries for fear factor. It's a stealth game and just like most in the stealth genre, violence isn't nearly as frequent as say, COD or Battlefield. I'd say a relatively mature 13 yr old, or a VERY mature 12 yr old could play this. It's teen, make your choice parents...

You can kill Hitler!
Hi Im Adam. My son wanted this game for Christmas, however I said no. The following day I let him watch Saving Private Ryan. After seeing the cool sniper in that movie this game came back up as a huge topic. Finally, I said yes. This is why. Let me just say this, all parents who doesn't let your kid play sniper elite because of the kill cam is ok in thinking that, however this kill cam can be turned off. The kill cam is a camera that follows your bullets as they hit your opponent. I've played the game campaign and never heard swearing. Is blood a problem? The kill cam option makes it hard to see blood because of the distance you are from your enemies. Finally lets talk about the story. As you can guess you take the role of a sniper in Africa. This man had one task, to stop the Nazis! Taking out German generals is incredible satisfying. One last thing, lets talk about Hitler. The most evil man in the world is in this game and you get to kill him! In conclusion, this game is 100% historically accurate and teaches you a lot about world war 2 (the only false thing is killing hitler) so any teen/kid or adult who has seen Saving Private Ryan should play! I give this game 5 stars and a age 12 and up rating! I hope this helped you, bye!

Great game and kind of historically accurate the only problem is the violence. But good news you can turn off kill cam so remember that before you let your child down.

Great game!
Now this is a challenging game but definitely a fun one! It's a little violent but not so bad it's a fun game and I'd say 12 to 13+!

Honest review
I played the first game and was hyped for the release of Sniper Elite 3, I was very disappointed with the product. The game is way too complicated, for example you have to be as stealthy as possible otherwise you will be heard resulting in enemies hunting you down. Then once you have 'stealth-killed' the enemy, you have to carry their body to the best hiding spot so it is not discovered, then you have to move as slowly and as quietly as possible so as not to be heard and to keep your heart rate down. Also each level is at least an hour long, then there is the multiplayer, which is a whole different topic. The only 'positive' feature of the game is the x-ray kill cam which is very gory , yet satisfying. However this is only achievable if the bullet finds its target which it probably won't. I like how the game tries to be realistic, but I would just save your money for the next Watch Dogs.

Doesn't deserve 18+
Sniper elite 3 puts you in the shoe of a sniper in north Africa. He has many different objectives he needs to complete and all of them revolve around making your way through maps filled with enemy troops.

The main and ONLY thing that would trigger any parent's alarm would be the violence. If you shoot an enemy from a long distance and hit on target the game goes into and x-ray cutscene that shows the bones and main organs in the body. It then shows you where you have hit them and shows the bullet pierce wherever you have hit resulting in blood and some gore. Now the game is rated 16+ in England, does it deserve this rating? Yes, it does. Not because you should be 16+ to play it, but simply because it would be wrong to place the game at 12+. If your child has played anything from the likes of call of duty or battle field they will be fine with this game. The one exception to this is if they dislike blood! This game is great and the only factor is blood, not a problem for most! 12+ due to the x-ray cutscenes.


Tips: if your child has a friend who plays this game and you have multiplayer access then this is great!

If you are worried about the "unmoderated chat" in some of the reviews on this site than you can edit parental settings in consoles.

Hope this review was helpful and helped you understand why you child of 12 or older should be playing this game!

Super gory, but fun.
This game can get really hard. You can change the frequency of the and Xray camera, which shows in Xray vision EVERY body part breaking. Some cussing that isn't horrible.

Good for 13 and up
This game is fine for 13+. There is some gore and violence and some mild language. The game takes place during WWII so there is some learning

Rehashed content, underwhelming and short.
For a 40 dollar price tag, this is a very short and boring entry, especially for those who have played Destiny 1. For the few that will actually play the raid and fractions that will complete it, this is another raid of mechanic heavy waves of the same adds with a reskinned oversized boss at the end. You will be required to know your specific role and learn the mechanics as the encounters in the raid are more about doing specific tasks in sequence without dying rather than engaging an epic boss and surviving his attack patterns . The formula is predictable and bland with little to offer for single players. For the most part, this is more content to play the same thing multiple times to level up to do the same stuff over on a harder level or for the new raid itself, New Light players who are new to the game may find it packed with content, but not much for those already invested. The big sell is the new gear system, but aside from these "tweaks", nothing here is changing the game in huge ways. With endless materials and trinkets to obtain for hours and days worth of game play, anyone who doesn't dump a crazy amount of time in will find much of it overwhelming and often futile as rewards verses time spent is bent towards the obsessive couch potato. This entry is not worth the price tag, but hardcore fans will love it just being more Destiny. I was once, and still know people, who play this game for hours a day. THAT is the audience this game wants to keep happy as they spend alot on DLC and the most obsessed spend oodles on cosmetics and loot as 1/3 of Bungies revenue is derived from extras alone. And be sure we will be doing this now every 3 to 4 months from now on. This game is a formula now that will probably stay on course for years to come. For me....no thanks.

Good, but not great DLC has more intensity; some heretic elements may not be for children.
Ok before I start Im gonna include everything in Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is an online shooter that promotes teamwork and avenging our race. Violence wise, this game has intense first-person combat that promotes killing aliens and robots using a variety of weapons including pistols, auto rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, fusion rifles-high caliber weapons that fires a burst of energy-rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and swords as well as a range of magical abilities that can injure and even disintegrate enemies. Also, some of the weapons are called "exotics" which do special things, for example, the hand cannon Crimson's exotic perk allows you to gain health upon killing enemies, and it's default appearance contains blood on it. Any other blood appearing from the player is smeared on the screen. Players may also go against other players in many modes in the Crucible. Also, the review for the blood is all wrong. When you precision shot a Cabal soldier, a mixture of oil and gas spurts out, not blood. With the introduction of the Scorn in Forsaken, precision shots first explode their head, and if you look at their dead body they look very disturbing. Sexual content wise, there is a Crimson Days event that allows you and your "partner" to go against another pair of lovers and defeat them, and Lord Shaxx's dialogue may be mildly inappropriate. Other than that, no sexual themes. Language wise, there is a couple hell's, some damn's, one rumor of an a**hole, and *spoilers* when Cayde 6 dies, Ikora says "We will mount the head of that son of a bitch on his throne," other than that, the only other language is through the enabled chat. Consumerism wise, there is a heap of Destiny 2 merchandising on it's website, and on others as well. Players may also experience hackers in PVP, and it may be very annoying. No drugs, but Cayde mentions some drinks.

Fantastic Symbolism and Story Aspects
Absolutely fantastic game even if the storyline is short but it keeps you on suspense until the other dlc's drop, and the symbolism of Eris, who has PTSD is amazingly portrayed well and respected.

Good, but not Perfect
To anyone under the age of twelve, this will appear to just be another bullet sponge ridden game. However, there's a lot of depth to it that requires a lot of time to be put into. Some aspects require cooperation with others, so its best to stick with people who are mature enough to communicate clearly with others.

ITS A BLAST AND ITS FREE
It’s a FPS consisting of team work while swearing is present if you can manage to put it to the side it’s an amazing game for youth I have personally put over 400 hours into it and there is not much blood and no gore. Hope my review helped you! Good day
