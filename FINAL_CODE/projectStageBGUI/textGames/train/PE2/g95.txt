Difficult. If your kid's been playing games for five years, shooters, mostly, they'll be good enough at it.

Gears 5 is a game which yes may have a bit of blood but hat can be turned off in the settings . So the only bad thing is the language but the language isn’t really really bad it uses the s word and a very few amount of f bombs . The only reason I’ve said 11 is because of the language . Other than that the game is great. In addition this game also represents teamwork .

Blood/swearing can be disabled
Amazing cover based shooter with fun gameplay. and before you go "oh but its super bloody though", actually one of the first things that come up when you start the game is the option to turn off swearing and gore. and with that off there is literally no gore at all.

Good game
It’s a great game, just some blood and swearing. You can turn off mature content, gore, and most of the language in options, and that improves the game a lot. I only turned off mature content and language, you don’t really need to for the gore.

Violent however can be turned off
I've been playing the gears of war franchise for over 3 years now and what I've noticed in it is that there is a setting where you can turn off the blood/gore, cussing, adult content, etc. So if you are thinking about getting the game make sure you have a talk before you let them sit down and play!

A Great Family Game
We bought Torchlight 2 for everyone in our family, and we play it together sometimes on Family Game Night through our local Ethernet. (We wired all the rooms in our house with Ethernet, so we have our own network.) The game is a fun point-and-click adventure that takes up where Torchlight left off. To begin a new game, you pick your character, either a berserker, an embermage, an outlander, or an engineer. You can choose to be either gender, with a plethora of choices for hair style, hair color, and face. Then you pick and name a pet. Pets are important, because you can send your pet back to town to sell items you don't want and buy items you do want, like healing potions.

You start by getting a quest to go to a nearby town. The beginning leg of the journey is rather easy, regardless of difficulty, allowing the player to learn the interface as he goes. Once in town, you get more quests and uncover more of the storyline.

I have played the main quest to completion three times, as an embermage, outlander, and engineer. Torchlight 2 contains lots of side quests, a hidden quest, and a lot of entertaining options along the way.

For people worried about privacy or safety, you can play the game all the way through by yourself. You do not need to log into a network. Torchlight 2 also has a local co-op option, with is how I play with my family. Again, only known people can (hopefully) access your local network.

While the game is mainly played for fun, if you play with others, you learn how to work as a group. Also, figuring out which weapons or armor to use requires some math knowledge.

Overall, I give Torchlight 2 a five-star rating.

okay game, for 9- 11
this game can be pretty bloody and gory, but the age rating goes down to 10 or 11 after you turn of the blood, which you can do in the settings. if it is still is to violent, consider getting your child fate, which is nowhere near as violent as any other rpg's like torchlight 2.

Great fantasy RPG, but not for under 13
Alright, this should be easy. Torchlight II is a fantasy RPG that involves defeating monsters to complete quests. However, right from the start, there is violence only to achieve a small thing. If you like those two things, you can ignore the rest of this. If you're a concerned parent, please keep reading. Due to the heavy violence, some parents might not want their kids (or themselves) to play it, and blood and gore are a crucial part of that experience. The developers have responded to the many (angry) reviews about the violence, so there is an option to disable blood and gore in the Options menu. This greatly improved the amount of younger players on Torchlight II, and many parents are happy with that. In summary, if you like achievement adventure, Torchlight II is for you.

torchlight 2-the paragraph
This game can be challenging and frustrating but it can also be fun and satisfying. Not to mention the variety of classes and pets. And also it is 3-d.

Very fun.
This is a very fun game the only bad thing about it is the fact that when you get very close to an enemy and critical hit them they explode into blood and guts.

a great game
torchlight 2 is a great adventure game! lots of content! if your not the type for the blood and guts there is an option in the settings to turn it off. i did find that it does NOT turn off purple goo or squished green spiders.

My two cents on Torchlight II.
Torchlight II is an incredibly fun and easy-to-play dungeon-crawler type game that I recommend for ages 9 and up. Although it has blood and gore by default, in the options screen, you can easily turn it off.

There is no sexual content, no swearing, no drinking, and it's quite easy to play and fun. It has some pretty cool and lovable characters, and I really recommend it for anyone who loves adventuring!

went overboard on the blood and gore
the only reason that i think its for older kids is the blood and gore other than that its a great you can explore and fight off monsters and get cool weapons!!! you can turn off the blood and gore in settings then it would make it a 10 and under so worth the 20$ awesome!!!

Great game, a little to bloody
A amazing game overall, diffenitly worth the $20. the blood is incredibly frequant and you fight humenoid (and occasionally human) enemys. though the blood can be turned off. you can play on public games, so you never know what you will come across in those.
