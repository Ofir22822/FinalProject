Great game
I have 300+ hours of gameplay worth it if they like FPS . All I've heard is damn and hell. The most scantily clad women is in a bathing suit for the summer event. Only thing to watch out for is voice chat. People are very toxic around this game. Like early COD toxic.

The game is friendly! Cartoon characters fighting. Kinda like smash... But, better. Although, their is a chat filter and a cigar with one of the characters. But it is still friendly!

Toxic players will ruin your child's experience
After having played this game with my child, I cannot describe in good enough detail just how toxic and vulgar other players are. And since the game is multiplayer (online only) there really isn't a way to avoid this. The game itself isn't substantially violent or lewd, but the people that play it will do their best to ruin your night. Avoid this one.

Over Sexualized Characters (Not suitable for children)
My only issues with this game come from the over sexualization of certain female characters in the game that I don’t think are a good influence for my son (13) and definitely a terrible example for my daughter(11). Some of the “skins” (different outfits) for the character Widowmaker and especially the default one look more like body paint rather than outfits appropriate for a game for children. I encourage other parents to look into this: https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/widowmaker/

overwatch
It is a good game. At first I did not want my son to get the game as I was scared of him playing with guns. However, I did my research observed the game being played and reluctantly gave in. It has turned out not to be so bad after all and my son really enjoys playing it. Personally, I suggest it for kids 10+ because it can scare younger children but other than that its a safe game for youth.

Best game for starters!
This is a great game for people who are just starting out gaming and would like something that is not too hard to master and get good at. It has a system that you will mostly come up against people at the same level or stage in the game as you. It is only online pvp with a selection of modes like capture the point escort the payload and finally a hybrid witch you have to capture a to get to escort the payload. There is a selection of about 24 heroes that each have different play styles and difficulties . Overall I think it is a great game that I enjoy playing a lot and I hope you will too!

Be careful what your children get into!
Overwatch is a game that has an absolutely horrible community and design team. The community during play is aggressive, racist, sexist, and everything in between. There is an African american hero that is commonly played and comments, both in chat and verbally, such as "Don't play the nigg***" or "Get that ghetto trash out of the game" are not uncommon. Overwatch doesn't censor anything - and because of that, the community has grown rampant. The design team is more involved in creating a game and not patrolling their actual communication within that game that I would not recommend this game to any parent with a child below 18.

This is a lie.
This is undoubtedly a kid friendly game. I don't know what this fool writer was doing when he wrote 2 stars for sex. There's barely any "sexual" content at all, with the most revealing dresses showing stomach and very few being skintight suits (which are admittedly still not that bad). As for the violence, of course there's going to be violence! It's a shooter. Duh. There's one character shown smoking a cigar, because he is a cowboy. There's options to turn off chat and voice chat to protect your children. There's no blood. I noticed the review saying, "characters get dismembered and fall apart." There's not a single character in the game that falls apart or gets dismembered. There's training robots that fall apart. That's it. And they aren't people like robots, they are squares. It promotes teamwork and is easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's absolutely nothing like the violent, edgy shooter that this website makes it appear to be. Do not listen to this site for this one. It doesn't know what it's talking about. I believe you should refer to the comments for this one. This is definitely one of the most mild FPS games out there.

Amazing!
I've been playing Overwatch for a while now. My sister let me play it, and now I'm addicted! It is a great game for adolescents ( 11+ ) to play. There are some things in the game for teens, like a sort of revealing outfit, light smoking, some LIGHT curse words ( damn, hell ) and some real curse words in other languages, but the real curse words are rare, and only happen in appropriate moments. This game is really 11+ because sometimes it can be extra difficult. On to the characters. There are so many! All of them come from different places, like Japan, China, Russia, Nigeria, Sweden, Korea, Britan, the list is so long! They also have some Omnics, AKA robots, and they even have an LGBT character with a girlfriend. They beautifully express how diversity makes a game SO much better. If you're kid turned 10/11, is a gamer, and is getting more mature and moving on from Skylanders, PVZ, Duckhunt, etc. The company that created this game, Blizzard, have also made cinematic shorts on the characters from Overwatch, and grab the tissues, they're SO heartwarming. Overall, this game has a gorgeously diverse cast, a differentiated but understandable demographic, and is set up amazingly. STOP READING THIS REVIEW, AND GO BUY OVERWATCH!

Overwatch is super graphic
Disgusting match chat and a decent amount of gore make this game for older kids, but for sure an awesome game.

Matchmaking is a joke. puts you against players you could never beat. Abusive player base that types nasty things when you win/lose. Creates loops where you play the same people that beat you over and over again. The game is designed to keep you where you are at, it is the game version of a big bully. complete waste of time and money.

Team-based FPS - positive messaging
Overwatch, fundamentally is a 6v6 team first person class-based shooter. There's no gore, and a built-in profanty filter.

The only thing that could potentially be a window for colorful language would be if you allow your kiddos to go into voice chat -- you can disable this functionality in game.

The overall storyline is a very positive, make the world a better place type of message. It's about diversity, and people standing up to become heros to help improve the world.

There are 100% optional microtransactions for cosmetic items -- but you also can earn them via playing as well. You will be at no disadvantage if you do not spend money on loot boxes.

It's far and away the most family friendly FPS you're going to find -- and on top of that -- they have multiple types of heros, including a number that don't rely on amazing aim.

If you're okay with your kids watching PG movies -- this game should give you no pause.

Good for kids 9 and over
Overwatch, Developed by blizzard studios, is a less gritty first person shooter with a big team element.
Alright, i just want to point out, i didnt just play it for an hour to see if it was good for my kid, my total play time is 300 hours, im a gamer, this is one of the games i play when my 11 year old son is at school and im off work, my wifes also a gamer, even more than me. Anyways, back to the point, if your kid is asking you for overwatch, DON'T listen to common sense media parents, they are very biased on fps games.
Overwatch isnt very violent, barely any blood, and promotes teamwork over simply killing your enemy. That being said, there are some things to take into account when buying overwatch for your child. First off, know that overwatch is a competitive game from start to finish, even quickplay can be competitve, so, if your child is a more casual gamer, Team Fortress 2, another Team based shooter, is better suited. Second, and most things parents look at, the community, there are toxic players, if your child has a squeaky voice, maybe pass on the mic, the overwatch community can be toxic as hell sometimes, did you know theres a video on the internet of 4 grown men bullying a 12 year old kid for playing the character Hanzo. Speaking of characters, while i did say that most overwatch characters are mostly positive, some have more darker, more grittier personalitys. "Hanzo" who i mentioned earlier, his backstory states that he mudered his brother, "Genji" at a young age, because Genji didnt want to serve the clan, and now Hanzo wants to redeem himself, after meeting genji, revived by the angel "Mercy", in the animated short, "Dragons". Others include Reaper, Widowmaker, Doomfist, Moria, and Roadhog to name a few, are characters that have much darker personalitys and backstorys. Despite all that, as long as your child knows rights from wrongs, they shouldnt have a problem with overwatch

AWESOMENESS... with a few little issues
I've updated my review now that I've played Overwatch via the Free Weekend event:
To say the graphics are good is an understatement. They are GORGEOUS!
Gameplay is a tad tricky though but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad.
There's no visible blood; once a character dies, he/she simply is replaced by a skull icon.
Open-mic chatting can be toggled off and there is also a profanity filter for the type-chat box! That's a relief! :D (However, some characters STILL DO utter "d--n" if injured, so still be wary of that.)
Apart from some curvy characters with tight outfits, there's no sexy trash in the game itself. But as I stated in my old review, the game's webcomic DOES feature two women kissing.
Finally, as I stated in my old review, some Christians (and/or Christian PARENTS!) might not appreciate some of the characters' dark appearances (and Reaper's catchphrase "Death walks among you" might not help matters, either! 0_o)
All in all, I'd say give Overwatch a shot with caution. Have fun! :D

Seizures: My son 13 and Many children and adults having seizures with Overwatch. Google Overwatch Seizures
My 13 year old was playing Overwatch for 3 weeks and one day after playing for a couple of hours, he dropped to floor in convulsions. No history or family history of seizures. Google " Overwatch Seizures." You will find countless people, children and adults, with no history or family history of seizures, having seizures during and after playing Overwatch. Beware.

Overwatch Compated to Pg-13
My child has seen countless pg-13 movies which are way more violent than this game. Overwatch doesn't have all the violence like a pg-13 movie does. For example my son has seen Hunger Games, Suicide Squad and a bunch of others which have blood and gore in them. Overwatch is way more mellow than a pg-13 movie. Here is why, Overwatch is unrealistic. For example you have a robot samurai that can summon a dragon by swinging his sword. You have a dude that shoots sound waves and can run on walls by using rollerblades. Let me also put it a different way. Many parents might know a game called minecraft, if you don't google it. Minecraft is a friendly, happy and fun game. Until you go into multiplayer. Your constantly killing people with swords, TNT, bows and lava. So why do we let our kids play it? It's because it's unrealistic. It doesn't look real! I mean you have a block dude running in a block and world swinging a block sword. Overwatch is just like that. It's unrealistic in the violence. It's like a teens version of Minecraft. It's not bloody and there isn't any foul language. Violence is not bad compared to other rated T games like Batman Arkham city, Destiny, and Injustice. I think it's fine and very mellow.

A game I am fine with.
I am one of those moms who is very careful about what my kid plays. I saw this game and looked into it because my kid really wanted it. I thought it was going to be this violent bloody game but it wasn't. It was very "cartoonish" and very little violence. There is no blood or swearing in the game. Compared to other rated "t" games I have seen, this is very mild. This is a great game to introduce your kid to rated "t."

This game is extremely tame for a fps. The violence is mild, not a drop of blood or gore and no sexual content at all. The 13+ is mainly due to the ability to communicate via mic but I limit my 11 year old son to custom and arcades with his friend whom are all around his age. I monitored his use and dont let him play in competitive as more advanced communication is recommended. The comunity on a whole is positive with a few toxic eggs here and there but as a player and a parent I highly recommend Overwatch as a good place for children age 9 and up to start.
