I LOVE THIS GAME. I don’t get why people are saying it’s bad though my little brother who is 8 plays it and he hasn’t changed a bit it’s actually made him more social (playing with his class which he wouldn’t usually do) Also it has increased the happiness he has overall he and I have a great time on it.

The Campaign is realistic, but the multiplier is fine.
The campaign does deal with a-lot of strong war subjects, the multiplier is fun, but camping is a issue. But overall a brilliant game, the campaign is for 15 and older, the multiplier is 12 and older.

13/15+
The Multiplayer aspect of the game is fine for ages 13+ as it is like any other Multiplayer call of duty mode and does not reveal the kid to offensive or disturbing scenes, the only thing it contains is blood and simply gun violence, something that is normal for such a game and something you should expect.

When it comes to the Campaign/Story mode of the game, I would say it is 15+ as it contains many offensive and disturbing scenes (some of which you can opt out on) including war crimes, torture and terrorist attacks. It shows the reality of war and puts the player directly in all of it. This could make it one of more disturbing games in the franchise such as the original Black Ops which also included war crimes and torture.

This game is not inappropriate whatsoever it’s educational!!!
This game teaches younger kids about modern day war. The language and blood can be turned of in settings. This game should be played by people 10 and up as they will learn about the war.

Amazing game
The game itself if you are a COD fan is the best we've had since 2013, the feel of it is just great. This game is a bit graphic although, only in the campaign and it does give you the option to turn it off. The content when not turned off includes civilians executed point blank. dead children, one kid shot off-screen, it definitely shows the darkness of war but some people may be able to take it.

Very Thoughtful, Very Real
Coming from a teenagers viewpoint, the story (if you want to experience it properly without cutting out any scenes or missions) is even disturbing to me, but they were going for realism. The campaign is ver real to what is happening around the world in the war against terror and it makes you think about that. There are missions where you’re forced to make very intense decisions, in one mission early on in the game, you shoot a person that looks like a civilian after they try to reach for a detonator to blow up a house that the character is in. That’s just one of the sequences, and that’s not even the worst one, maybe let little Timmy and Sally sit out on this one or find a way to make sure they only use the multiplayer which I’d say is good for about 14+.

Parental review
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 is a tactical shooter. The multiplayer is a fun and exciting mode with tons to choose from. Although there might be some blood if you get shot or die. (This is because the creator wanted to make it realistic). But, swearing, blood and gore can be just turned off in the settings.

The campaign is quite graphic though. It displays some very dark scenes and distressing moments. But, there isn’t many of those scenes and all the other scenes are quite user friendly.

I think you should only get this game if you think your child is mature enough for this game.

I hope you found this review helpful.

I like it.
It's a call of duty game, so its going to have some blood, but the movie Mulan has blood in it. I like it because I'm a sucker for the fps gerne. Its just over priced, not including in-game purchases. Its more of a "Yay, I got this game for christmas!" kind of a game. i think a mature 9-year old could play this, but you should just leave this one to the middle schoolers.

oldie but goodie
This game is so fun and entertaining ! Lots of problem solving and hidden puzzles to unlock. Can be spooky but nothing your little ones can't overcome. If anything it teaches your child to brave, headstrong, and to never give up !

The best video game of all time!
I simply cannot put MediEvil into words, due to it being the prime example of what a video game should be. The way it values taking your time and slowly progressing through problem solving and testing strategies. Look no further, MediEvil is the perfect game to introduce video games to your children.

Since the game is so complicated, I will have to keep this plot and description here short: The Game is about a soldier who was known to have killed an evil sorcerer named Zarok with his own mighty power, but we find out this man was not the hero we thought. He was a failure to say the least, and had died before he had even gotten close to the sorcerer. He died with a blow to the eye. BUT, many years later, the soldier awakens from the dead to find out that the sorcerer had returned! Originally, Zarok had spawned evil demons in the town, so he did it again from the dead. The soldier now has his chance to stop Zarok and be the true hero he had thought to had been.

Now that you are familiar with the plot, you know that the character will be killing demons, zombies and the like, and that is very true. Here is all of the violent stuff that can and will happen:

As the soldier, you can slash, crush, bash and ram zombies, demons, imps, scarecrow creatures, and more. When you do this, a very large amount green blood will spurt out on every hit until the monster is dead. You do this on every part in the game, and it it constant.

Through the game, you also see blood splattered areas, decapitated bodies, corpses hung on nooses, bodies ripped in half and more. Each one of these things have a fair to large amount of blood.

When you kill specific types of creatures, red blood will splatter out into the air, and most will spray onto the walls and pool on the floor. The most frequently killed creatures are rats, which you have to brutally crush with hammers and clubs. This is overly graphic, and they are shown smashed open. Plus, blood is also shown in overwhelming amounts on the ground.

Sir Daniel Fortesque rips out guts from his eyehole.

There is more violence and blood through out the game, but it isn’t that graphic.

OVERALL: The Game isn’t as bad as it seems, and the violence is comical and the premise is silly and fun. The zombies look mostly laughable, and the imps are little Red Devils. This is fine for 8-12 year olds easily!!
