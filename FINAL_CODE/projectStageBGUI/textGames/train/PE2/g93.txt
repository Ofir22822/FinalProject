Best Fantasy Game Of 2019
A great fantasy game full of things to do so much detail lie if you spend time with you're companions you can get to have a boy or girl friend
Like racism Natives are called savages, Thélème a religion group kill those who don't renounce there gods and they will sometimes will convert people to there beliefs by force

You can explore The Island so many monsters and each place has a cast of charters all of them different and in there own way you will need to upgrade to you're friends gear to have a better chance of victory in battle with foes and enemies you can upgrade youre weapons you can be fighter or gunman or wizard Do want to be Good Or Evil Side with any faction

But remember actions have consequences if youre like if you do bad things to one faction one of you're companions will leave you and become Foes

For instance you want to be a native warrior or priest of Theleme

Its you're story

Welcome To Greed Fall

Not bad...
A game set in a fantasy world where you play an important role in the land, your choices can effect your storyline.
I wouldn't say you could be a bad person in this game but it depends on your own opinion. Yes there is romance options though they don't go indeph, nothing more than kissing and a black screen that fades in after. There's abit of blood with the combat but most of the time you are fighting enemies or fantasy creatures.

This game is a masterpiece
This is one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. The gameplay is simple yet difficult. The armors and monsters all look fantastic.

Noice
The game has a living, breathing, ecosystem that immerses you into the fictional world of the New World. Great bosses, weapons, and armor.

What is basketball doing in my Casino game?
Imagine buying a sixty dollar game and having to pay for everything and the game has a literal slot machine. You heard me, actual gambling. Surprise mechanics, my ... They really need to change the rating. Honestly just get your kid a decent game that they can actually enjoy.

Great game for basketball fans
Great game. My only concern is that the Nba2k games are the same every year with no big changes.Also, it may take a little time to get use to the controls.

Good in terms of gameplay and modes, but not easy to learn.
It's a very good, well-built game in terms of graphics and gameplay. The modes were very well built, with MyCareer and MyLeague. MyGM is a little disappointing, but ok nonetheless. The MyPlayer builder is AMAZING!

Now, onto the cons. You don't really get to upgrade your MyPlayer much without VC. You'll probably get to about 88 OVR if you're lucky. Another thing is consumerism. In MyCareer, your player openly gets deals with different brands sponsored by the NBA, such as Beats, Gatorade, and Foot Locker. You can also choose between shoe brands such as Jordan, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Anta, and New Balance. They openly promote these products. There is also a shoe builder, where you can create your own shoe. You choose between any brand you want.
