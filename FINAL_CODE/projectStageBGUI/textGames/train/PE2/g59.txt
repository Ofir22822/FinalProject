This is a great game and the age rating is way too high it is fine for any young teens and up although maybe for 10-12 year olds don't let them play the campaign but apart from that it is a very good game for most ages

NOT FOR KIDS.
The campaign is showing war. It is toned down and stylelzed a bit but you still see body's burn, you have to use a mom and a son in a part to get info,you have to shoot woman and men, and etc. It seems like many kids are saying 10+ and that's not true. Mutilplayer is definitely less bloody and Gorey but I wouldn't recommend it for kids. Over all this game is ment to touch on some of war and show some of it's dark sides. Your kid if they are 15-16+ probably know this by now and could probably find real pictures and videos of it online if they wanted to. But for the love of all things holy and good do not like a 10 year old play this game! Let them play something else not this.

WHAT!
This game shouldn’t be an 18 sure the campaign is a bit brutal but 18!!!!!! If I were you I wouldn’t let your kid play the campaign but let them play all the other game modes which are multiplayer and spec ops

Definitely not for Children
I’m 23, grown up with these games. Started playing around 12-13. Probably a good age to start. This games’ multiplayer I could knock down to 11. It’s just moderate violence and moderate blood. I don’t think any tween with sound mental health would be effected by it. The campaign however... one of the most graphic. One level in particular you are given a high powered sniper rifle and it can realistically shoot off the limbs and heads of enemies. Small children and tweens for sure will be disturbed by this. Otherwise a great game!

Take the M rating seriously.
I'm letting anyone know right now. DO NOT LET CHILREN PLAY THIS!!! It's absolutely not suitable for anyone under the age of 17/18+. Hell in my opinion it seems more like for 20 and up. At first I thought it wasn't going to be this bad but then I had to see it for myself just to know how wrong I was. It's straight up disturbing, dark, brutal, too torture-some and so on that I wish I can unsee what I've seen. It questions on very, and I mean VERY heavy war topics and morals that not a lot of people will understand and just take it like "Oh, it's just a game." Not really. This COD title is very different from other COD games. It's not your typical over the top fps shooter where they're out in space or in a futuristic type of setting game no, this one shows more of reality and portray the horrors of war that can be gruesome at times, heartbreaking or unsettling. Players can make very intense decisions that it may just go over your head without thinking of the serious consequences of your actions. And there's torture. Can be very upsetting for some people. I'm not saying I didn't like it. I did. However, you shouldn't let your kid play it if they're not mature enough to handle it. It don't matter what their age is, even if you think they can handle it, I'm just saying. Don't do it. Especially if you have a sensitive child, don't desensitized them to play it. Not worth it. Maybe multiplayer mode yes, it's fine for anyone 14/15+. But the campaign mode, 18+ only!!! Seriously it takes a lot of maturity to endure and take in something. Be safe and be careful.

This game is just like every other shooter game
I have no idea why this game is 18 and up the blood is barely visible and you can't hear the swearing unless you are really listening for it this game is fine for kids with the maturity of a normal 10 year old.

Same ol game new year
This is another rehash of previous versions. Updated boards, quicker kills..same ol stuff. New campaign is the usual. A campaign for COD. Everyone knows you buy this for the multiplayer. Which the multiplayer has become a “campers” nest. More of getting shot in the back, spawn killing and parents using the game as a baby sitter. Players exploit every nook of the different maps and every shadow turning this game into something you wish you didn’t spend as much as you did.

Great game
Good game. Campaign has lots of over the top pew pew. Blood is not much of a problem this time around compared to other cod games like black ops or world at war in which you can blow peoples limbs off. Language is quite constant but its nothing worse than what your kid mostly likely hears in school or from other adults. Multiplayer is also real fun. Map selection could be better though. Great game, great campaign great multiplayer. I'm sure this game is fine for a mature tween.

This game is amazing
I personally love his game especially the campaign . It’s not as violent as black ops 1 , world war 2 and world at war -to people who don’t know they are all call of duty games. I think this is the least violent multiplayer. The campaign can be dogy at times but is usually not violent at all.

BEST COD!!!!!
This game is phenomenal! Sure it can be a bit gritty at times but you can turn blood and swearing. The campaign can be ( very rarely)disturbing but it portrays positive messages.

Pretty good campaign.
I havent bothered with the MP and the SP is very short at just under 4 hours (thankfully im not the one who bought the game) but its very intense and has the gameplay nuance and charm of MW1. Just dont expect a deep or morally grey story advertised so much (Russians are basically ISIS McHitler here).
Its also the most graphic of the MW games. With gore akin to the Treyarch games; particularly the more grounded, brutal and disturbing kind seen in WaW or BO1 than the Tarintino-ish violence of BO2, 3 and 4. This time with 4K and photoreal detail.

Absolutely NOT for Children
This is the most disturbing, morally questionable campaign in Call of Duty history. Civilians are slaughtered by terrorists, chemical weapons are used, and war crimes are committed in abundance. Children are put in harm's way of the player. It is very much possible, and indeed likely, to kill innocent people.

Players must have the maturity level to understand the seriousness of the scenarios they are in, and even then, pulling the trigger (or not) in the campaign can be straight-up traumatizing.

The multiplayer portion of the game is visceral and impactful, but not nearly as harrowing as the campaign. Still, the use of white phosphorus as a kill streak is a morally bankrupt decision that taints the otherwise age 14+ multiplayer experience.

That being said, Modern Warfare is a complete package. You cannot separate the campaign from the multiplayer as one grants access to the other. As a result, I highly recommend keeping this away from children altogether. The game could have carried an AO rating if it weren't coming from Activision.

I have played every Call of Duty to date, and have logged thousands of hours on this franchise. This is not like the others. Don't dismiss the warnings of critics and other players. This game can and will give nightmares, and enables players to commit atrocities, by accident or otherwise. Do not make the mistake of buying this for children.

Other Call of Duty games may be 'fine,' but Modern Warfare 2019 is best suited for those 18+.
