Beyond Two Souls is a cinematic like game, one that you’d probably only play once, maybe twice for hidden eggs or nostalgic purposes, but it’s worth it.

I wouldn’t say this games my favourite, not even my top 3, but I definitely recommend it, but only if you’re not looking for much a challenge.
It does have quick time events, but from what I know, you can’t die from any of them.
It involves violence that you can choose to avoid (but sometimes avoiding it is the wrong decision), an example *SPOILER ALERT* is a scene where the protaganist, Jodie, sneaks out to go to a bar and almost gets molested. That’s where you come in as Aiden, you’re forced to hurt/kill them to save Jodie, but you also choose how far you go with it, either you can leave it with killing them, or start destroying everything.

Though, I wouldn’t say this game is 18+. Of course, some themes are pretty mature, I’d say that as long as your child is mature and knows the difference between good and bad, let them play it.
It shows you the consequences of your actions, and has some really good and memorable moments.

No nudity, one scene where you can choose to have sex (but it’s not shown and you can choose not to have sex) and really no drug/alcohol use. It shows what it’s like to be homeless, to be in the military (kinda) and what it’s like to be given away.

This should not be 18+. I played it when I was 12 (i’m 13 now) and I didn’t know it was 18+. I thought it was like 13+ because it wasn’t scary or anything. Yes it is much swearing and a little drinking and stuff but nothing a 13 year old can’t handle. I think that people are a little ov ... continue reading

Good story
Well the game is fine at the beginning, but when you are on missions you might have to choke some guys down or kill them. The game doesn't contain that much gore. It's basically just death and blood. For me the game was really normal and calm and exciting. Yes, it is gun shooting. And it does have some romance scenes but they aren't showing any naked bodies. The game does swear.. But overall it's good. And I recommend it for teens especially. Those who are 8,9,10,11 might get shocked by it or get disgusted by the violence and blood. So don't let one of your younger children get the hands on this game! :^]

Should not be 18
I am a 14 year old girl, and I don’t think this game should’ve been 18+ yes it does have a lot of curse words and it has some blood in it, it also contains drugs and suicide and rape, all very serious subjects. It has some sex scenes aswell, but does not show anything that a 16 year old couldn’t handle. This game is really emotional aswell. It contains some violence. In my opinion this game is something a 16 year old could handle as I mentioned earlier. Not all 16 year olds are the same though. I was 14, and I know that a lot of 14 year olds wouldn’t be able to handle this game, but I know a lot that 16 year olds would.

Beyond Two Soul's Review:
It is an amazing game! It has a mix of emotions. There is quite strong violance and swearing but there is not much sex. That's why I would recommend this game 15+

Cinematic singleplayer game with deep story
The game has one hell of story that deals with, homelessness, acceptance, sexual assault and more. You take the role as a female character who has been living with a ghost all her life. Violence isn't that frequent, but is bloody. Blood is resulted in shooting enemies. You punch, kick, snap necks and possess enemies to kill other enemies. Language is occasional and strong; a-words, f-words, s-words. Sexuality is a factor. The game includes a man attempting to rape a young girl, another man willing to pay a homeless girl to give him a bl**job and a making out scene.

Criminally underrated
Beyond: Two Souls is definitely on my top 5 games. I have played games like Uncharted, The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption 2, the Fallout, Skyrim etc. and this is still among the best I have played. I know this game doesn't have the best reviews, but before you decide the game is not good, play it and decide for yourself. Aside from a few scenes with violence, this game contains nothing worse than a PG-13 movie would.

Great if your kid is mature
There is a sex scene (with clothes on,) but if your kid is mature enough, then you should let them play it. It has a really good storyline, and you get emotionally connected to the character. There is a lot of violence, like fighting, suicide references, but if your kid is mature they'll be fine with it.

A GREAT game!
Beyond two souls is a really good game. It makes you cry,excited and it is adventurous. I don't really want to spoil the game, but it's about a girl and she has a "sidekick?" named Aiden. You can't see him, he is some ghost/spirit who protects her. Aiden can cause damage and there are very little "ooh" scenes but I play this game with my mom and even she likes it.

Deep
Beyond two souls is a deep emotional journey through Jodie's life. This game is defiantly a light M (which is the complete opposite of David Cage's previous game) and gets a 89.9/100 (A-)

Amazing game but not for those under 14
While I this is an amazing game to play with an awesome back story, it is NOT a game for kids. Not only is there brief nudity (in one of the many endings) but there is implied sex. While the whole walking around in underwear isn't that big of a deal seeing that Jodie is wearing a shirt and you see worse at the beach, there are scenes that definitely aren't for kids 14 and under. I thought fifteen would be a good age seeing as they are most likely already in high school and exposed to many things.

Beyond: Two Souls good but not as interesting as Heavy Rain
From quantum dreams, Beyond two souls really impressed me as i was a big fan of heavy rain, i hoped high for David cage and i enjoyed every second of this game. This has action but be warned it is extremely creepy and scary with a couple of jump scares. I got really annoyed with the way it went forward and back in time but you'll understand the story.Is it better than Heavy Rain? NO! Heavy rain has a better story and controls but Jodie (Ellen Page) in beyond two souls CANNOT die. Still, exceptional execution of gameplay.

Should be great for kids 10+
Ok so this game might seem bad at a first glance... It truly isn't. Although there is a lot of cussing in the game. Blood is in very small cuts and large "gore" as you would call it rarely happens and I am yet to see it happen. The violence is happening often but mostly it is fighting with your entity against other entity's. Even with fighting with Jodie, the main character, it's normally fist fighting and a gun is very rarely in her hand. Sexual activity is at a low even though some people would say otherwise. All in all this is an utterly amazing game. The game makes you feel emotional along with the characters and makes you feel IN the game. Amazing cut scenes, action, and visuals are great and I think that this game is great for kids.

VERY GOOD GAME
This Game is very good but not for young kids it has violence and kissing but not really any sex. You can cause much damage with Aiden (Jodie's inside friend) and you fight a lot as Jodie as well. This is a amazing game with an amazing story an I'm sure many people will love it.

Live an Avengers Adventure!
Really good game. 4 character co-op mode is fun. Reminds me of the old TMNT or Gauntlet games. A huge gallery of characters to choose from once you defeat them or reach certain levels. The violence is anything you would see in any superhero fighting game. No blood. Just knocking people over as their life status bar wears down. The main thing I was surprised by is the high usage rate of the word "hell" in the game. In names of places, items, and characters saying "What the hell..." I suppose it's considered a mild swear if at all anymore but it's enough that I don't want my 6 year old hearing it.

Fantastic solid Action-packed Avengers game protrays teamwork
Parents need to know that Marvel Ultimate Alience 3 is the third game in the Ultimate Alience Franchise. But unlike the others this is its own standalone threequel. The story is about the infinity stones and to stop thanos with your own Alience like in Infinity War and Endgame. In order to stop Thanos Teamwork and messages are key in order to stop thanos with excellent role models. Living up to a Marvel game be ready for lots of superpowered Sci-Fi Combat with intense confrontations players turning to dust. Plus once a character on your side gets knocked out than it happens in a climatic intense sequence commonly. There is a bit of blood in fights but it is generally the Sci-Fi space fights that show. There is some rude humor with a few uses of stupid and idiot also some reveling outfits but nothing that bad. But along with Exellent role models and amazing messages and this is a fantastic game that lots of gamers should play. The controls are easy but the bosses can lead to raging when knocked out a lot.

DQB1 was great, DQB2 is terrible
This game is just plain bad and I'll have a go at telling you why.

1. DQB 1 was almost an openworld game, in which you could follow the story and progress through it, while taking breaks to build your town as YOU pleased. For my kids who love minecraft this was a huge succes.

Very Dark Themes
If you have concerns with allowing your child to be exposed to the dark arts, and many very dark spiritual matters, don't consider this game. On first glance this game looks fantastic and is very fun, with some concerns throughout the game, but by Chapter 9 it's excessive and very problematic with no way to continue the game by avoiding it. Beware!

Great good feeling game
The game is full of positive messages. It will be hard for a kid that can’t read because there is much reading to do. The writing is funny and engaging. The game keeps you constantly engaged and it’s fun to see all the characters interact with you. It’s safe for kids! And fun for parents. Even if you don’t like Minecraft, this game will have you building in no time! It’s also a great introduction to rpg elements and the Dragon Quest Franchise.

Probably one of the best games I have played
Great game although something too know is that near the end there is a pool of blood and lots of dead bodies but the blood looks more like kool-aid and the game often brings up that the world is a illusion so only more mature children should play this game, the game is sometimes confusing at parts but overall an amazing game!
