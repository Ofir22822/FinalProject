 
Literally the greatest game ever!
I'm the biggest Star Wars Geek out there and of course I got to play this game. The story is amazing and the graphics make it look like its a live action movie. Some parts are a little mature. Such as when you go to Dathomir and are sent to fight against undead witches and demon looking men. Some special moves are shown slicing troopers or stabbing them but never taking the body parts off! Highly recommend it if you or your child is really into Star Wars

Best Story Game Ever
Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order is probably the best Star Wars game ever rivalling Star Wars battlefront II (the original) and Star Wars Kights Of The Old Republic. As you play through the story you will experience lots of twists and turns to the plot and some exciting boss fights. I recommend that if you do get this game, you should go off to explore and find secrets. The game has thoughtful and challenging combat using a lightsaber. None of the combat is particularly violent, occasionally you can slice creatures (no humans) lims or intire body in half which may be too intense for younger children. There are also some dark story themes to it. The main ones being a main character going through torture and a witch bringing her dead sisters back to life using powerful rituals. Overall though this game is fine for anyone aged 13+. Great game.

This game is great for kids!!
this game is utterly amazing the graphics and the story are out of this world hours upon hours of play with this game. The does include fighting but no blood or anything along those lines are shown the game is great for kids that want a challenge the fighting mechanics can be hard even for long time gamer's like myself but practice makes perfect and this game has a lot of room for trial and error so dont be afraid of losing great for kids 8 and up and would highly recommend this. No swearing, No hardcore violence an great fun for star wars fans

NOT MUCH VIOLENCE
its a good game there is no swearing(some violence)but not that much of violence it should be 12+ i liked the game it was fun and i also think that pegi is NOT always right so i use this website to see the ratings of parents and kids, sometimes pegi exaggerate.
at the end i want to thank common sense media and parents.
and thanks to EA and RESPAWN ENTERTAINMENT.
THANK YOU ALL.

One of the best Star Wars games
It doesn't matter if your into Star Wars or not, you have to play this game!!!
Jedi Fallen Order is an action adventure game with a captivating and intriguing story with a sense of mystery and being part of something bigger. It has some of the best graphics, level design and storytelling out there.
The only problem is that it doesn't have multiplayer, which isn't even that big of a critisism! Just go and buy it, now!

This Game Is Amazing!
This game is beautifully crafted from both a star wars cinematic universe standpoint, and just as a game in general. The story is engaging, very elaborate and overall expertly crafted like something from a tv series. The fighting sequences are amazing as well. as for violence, this game isnt really that violent. I know slicing people with lightsabers would appear to be violent, but the violence isnt glorified in any way (as the main character is fighting for peace) and the battles arent too intense either (theres no blood or gore really). To be honest, thats really the only thing that would constitute concerns parentally and there isnt much else weighing on this brilliant game. Overall, as long as you think your kid is mature enough for the mild violence in this game, i think it is a must-purchase for star wars fans!!!

Good, but could have been better
The game's storyline is impressive, although at the beginning at the game there is some profanity. There is alots of peril and the use of H*ll and b*stard. There is no dismemberment like the other games. The story is not finished though. Enemies will discourage you and insult you.

I have completed this game twice and it is my second favorite star wars game of all time!(Behind Battlefront 2) I dont know about the T rating by ESRB. The worst thing in this game is dismemberment. Not human dismemberment though! Animal dismemberment. And even so the violence is not bat at all. I think it's fine for anyone 7 and up. Please pick this game up for your kid!

Amazing game
Not a pegi 16, no idea what that was about, suitable for any age but might be a bit complex for younger kids. Someone was waffling about witchcraft in the game, I mean, grow up, witches aren't real and we burnt lots of innocent women by pretending they were. So unless your silly enough to be scared of 'demonic forces' in the game, I suggest you buy it immediately.

Amazing Game- Pretty Brutal and immersive but very good
Here is my Ratings
Violence: There is loads of violence, you can impale people with your lightsaber and smash them into the ground. You can also slice them across the waist causing lightsaber slashes to appear on them. With the humans here is no blood or dismemberment, however you can slice creatures in half and even cut their head’s off in some places.
Sex: none
Language: They use hell sometimes and the word Bas***d is used once in a cutscene
Positive Role models:: with an excellent story and Cal as the main character there are lots of positive role models in the game
Fear: there is menacing music and in a cut scene a woman Jedi is tortured by the empire but a black screen covers most of it up
Amazing game with a brilliant campaign but definitely not for younger kids!

Fantastic in every way
Graphics: B+
The visuals are fantastic, but the game may be a bit glitchy, only during cutscenes. However, that problem differs between people.

Gameplay: A
The controls are different, but well thought-out. A lengthy "tutorial" that really feels like the game will teach you everything you need to know. Different difficulty settings make it appropriate for everyone. Still, some puzzles may be difficult for younger children.

Story: A+++
I'm sorry, but the comics made me a sucker for the Inquisitors. There's so much brilliance in the game's writing that I can't describe it all. It's incredibly immersive, and some parts literally made me shiver with joy. Not only is it fun, it's heartfelt, with messages of finding yourself and getting through sadness.

People are wrong
Listen up. Saying the violence is intense is stupid. It's Star Wars violence. There is no blood just little orange marks on Stormtrooper bodies. Not bad. If you can't handle the concept that human beings can die than you need to toughen up.

Amazing!!!
To start, this is not 14 and up. I think a 9 year old could play it.

Violence: 6/10, There is a fair amount of violence but it is not bloody or graphic. It should be fine for 8 year old's.

Language: 3/10, There is one use of the B word.

Sex: 0/10

Drinking- drugs, 0/10

Overall, this ... continue reading

Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single player action adventure game developed by Respawn Entertainment, the developers of Apex Legends. In Fallen Order, players play as Cal Kestis, the survivor of the Jedi Purge. Untrusting and frightened, Cal needs to relearn the ways of the Force to find a list of Force-Sensitive children. Accompanying him are Cere Junda, a Former Jedi, Greez Dritus, a stubborn pilot, and the adorable BD-1. However, he is being hunted by the evil Imperial Inquisitor, the Second Sister and her platoons of Stormtroopers and Purgetroopers. The game has excellent mechanics, from the sword fighting gameplay inspired by Breath of the Wild, Sekiro, and Dark Souls, to the puzzle solving aspect similar to Portal, as well as a 62+-0ridiculous poncho customizer. The game features a natural progression system, with a skill tree. The game is currently harboring a good 79% on Metacritic. Some things I really think help the game are the customization, the satisfaction of wal running, and the interesting story. One drawback is the story feels a little short. I would give JFO a 4.7/5. Some of the encounters with bad guys can be a little violent, but you can only dismember non humans. It might be a little scary sometimes, though.

Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order | Video-Game Review
Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is honestly one of my favorite video-games of all time. I thought it would be another Star Wars video-game failure (no offense) just like Star Wars Battlefront II. Cause that game wasn’t all that great. However, the graphics are really great, the plot / story is very engaging and brilliant, and about halfway through the game I felt empathy for all these characters. This game FELT like it had the potential to be an amazing spin-off Movie, just like Solo and Rogue One. Also, the controls are astonishing. It is very easy to maneuver and it is satisfying to take control of a Jedi. As Cal Kestis, you can use Force Push, Force Freeze, Force Pull, Pull out double bladed lightsaber, Lightsaber Throw and much more that will keep you engaged. Also, I think that BD-1 is my favorite Star Wars droid in the entire franchise.

Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is definitely worth buying, if you want to have a satisfying and engaging gameplay of a day in the life of a Jedi.

Great addition to the Star Wars franchise
I think that this game is great for pre-teens who are starting to be allowed to play some M (I'm Austrailian) games. Note I have not finished the game, so I may not know some details, but I doubt there will be much worse than what I have already seen. It is a great game that I enjoy playing.

The violence in the game is more limited than this website, and most national ratings suggest, as, whilst you wield a lightsaber in the game, there is no blood. Alien and stormtrooper corpes do lie on the ground and not despawn until your next save, however they are not gross in the silightest, and should be fine for any child above 10.

There is no sex, or drugs/alcohol in the game, and the only language is the word bastard, which I have only heard once, and doubt it will be used again in the remaining section of the game.

The game is not addictive, and can actually get tedious after long amounts of play, preventing kids from grinding to upgrade - the format also prevents this, as it is a full campaign game, with most of the upgrades being progressive.

The main character is a great role mode as he stands up for what he thinks is right with the rebels, and displays the positive messages of not giving up, and freedom of voice.

Whilst it is a single-player only game, it is good to have some of these for if your friends can't play with you, or you don't have wifi.

This game is extremely fun, and I would reccomend it to any responsible kid above the age of 10, especially as a smooth transition to late PG to early M games (Once again, I'm Australian, so the ratings might be different for you). Although it is reasonably expensive, you can get it a lot cheaper second hand, or from some discount stores. Overall, great game, get it now.

This game is GREAT!!! I love how there is combat but also fun and challenging puzzles. Cal and BD-1 are a great team, and Cal only kills things that attack him first. There are a few dark spots, but never any blood.

Star Wars Fallen Order
I think this is an amazing game. It is a bit violent but if you are a star wars fan than you know that violent is not exactly the same as other games. Didn't catch any blood. It is a very complex game to learn though and if you don't play for a while than you WILL forget the controls but over all it is a great game. Big Star Wars fan

A fine game, definitely worth playing.
The game has very few flaws, mainly with its physics engine, and a few textures look incredibly bad (at least on ps4, I’ve not played on Xbox). Aside from those couple of issues, the game is great! I’m a fan of 3D platform and action games, and it definitely satisfies those areas. The games combat system is similar to Dark Souls, as it requires the player to have fast reactions and know the controls well. The challenge comes when your surrounded by a large group of enemies, as your health is relatively low, and you take a large amount of damage from attacks. The game isn’t nearly as hard as Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro, but it does provide a challenge, yet still being accessible for players new to the genre. The game also shines in its exploration. It provides incentive to look around every turn and corner, and feels somewhat like a metroidvania game, requiring certain abilities to access certain areas of the map, as well as skills in the platforming department. In short, the game has some minor flaws in the graphics department, but it really excels in its gameplay , with its fast paced combat, and the joy of exploring the many worlds the game offers.

Fantastic game with some scary elements.
This game is a must play for anyone who loves Star Wars, or action games in general. The combat itself is fantastic, and very skill based. The story puts an interesting spin on the post order 66 story. When the game was announced, I was worried the story would be another generic Jedi in hiding story, but the game’s story is great and original. As for violence, it’s mostly standard Star Wars, but there are a few scary elements. There are undead creatures that will likely frighten younger players, and a giant spider creature that could scare people with arachnophobia (like myself), and the battles can be intense. Overall, great game.

This game is incredibly detailed and has a compelling storyline and characters. This game has some violence simpler to the violence in the Star Wars movies. Their is only a very few instances where the word “bastard” is used.

Great game, some content small kids might find disturbing.
This game is amazing, from the story to the graphics, Respawn and EA did well. Creatures can be cut in half, but no human characters are dismembered. There is no blood or gore, so violence is at a minimum. Minimal language with a couple uses of hell and one use of bastard. The only disturbing piece is that on one certain planet there are undead creatures that can be resurrected through a chant. This game dives heavily into the spiritual beliefs in the Star Wars universe, but is overall a masterpiece of a game.

Beautiful graphics and extremely well-made game
This is a ridiculously well-made game with amazing, realistic graphics. There is no inappropriate content whatsoever, and the Jedi (and republic) characters are strong and care for each other. Once you reach this island when you are trying to get to a Jedi temple, there are some monsters that I think anyone 10 or under will NOT like. They have three bright orange eyes, move in a weird curling way and have teeth and fangs on their tongues. The violence is fine, there isn’t any blood, but there are constant enemies you will have to kill. This is an action packed, beautifully made (it is totally worth the price) game that I would recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or not. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t seen any of the Star Wars movies to play this. Thanks for reading!

Realistic, but not that violent
This game is about as violent as a Star Wars movie is. It has its battle moments, whether it be stormtroopers or battling other people with lightsabers. There is no dismemberment while fighting, and fighting scenes don't even last that long. Overall, great puzzles, awesome story, and amazing gameplay. I would put it at 10 and up for kids that can handle mild realistic violence. But definitely nothing over the top.

Uncharted for Children
It sometimes chops out alien/robot body parts so it changed my rating from E to 8. It does not have nothing inappropriate whatsoever. This game unlike other Star Wars Games has parkour with an Uncharted style into it, I would say it is an Uncharted for children. Really good game.
