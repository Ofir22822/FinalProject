It was ok
This game isn't too bad, but if you are worried about swears then don't let them play.Over all it is a good game.

An excellent game with quite a lot of mature content
This game is clearly among the best, but maybe it's also among the best *when you are an adult*. A lot of things are told with a really adult/cold approach.

Regarding the 16+ rating, I think some monsters really are gruesome and disturbing. I'm thinking 'The Crones' or the 'Botchling', which are not only visually disgusting but presented in contexts that are intense and maybe cruel.

About the sex it all depends how much your kid knows about it. I don't think the sex depicted in the game is too grotesque or offensive, it is quite explicit, a bit cheesy and maybe slightly sexist too. Were it only for the sexual scenes I'd give it a 14+ rating.

Not as bad as you wold think
This game is great although it does have a good
amount of inappropriate content but chances are if your kid is going to middle school they have seen much worse

Good for adults and mature teens
It has an interesting story with great graphics (providing you computer is good enough). However, this game is not for kids. There are multiple sex scenes and badges for accumulating “experiences”. It isn’t degrading to any characters in the game in any way, but there are bare breasts in the act and plenty of gratuitous scenes.

Basically Skyrim
It's very similar to skyrim. You do what you want and how you want to. You can turn language off and the blood is bad. There is sex in the game but you choose if you engage in it and you are not required to.

Great, but raunchy.
Amazing game, amazing story, it’s all you would ever want. But for kids it’s an ehhhh. People talk about how the nudity is the worst part but it’s only a small inconvenience compared to the rest. The game is dark and deep and kids at a younger age wouldn’t be able to appreciate and follow this game as more mature audiences would be able to comprehend what is going on. The game will briefly talk about rape, violence and wars. Then there’s the violence which can get very gory, but the only thing about that is if your kid can handle a lot of blood. Then there IS the nudity. You can engage in sex with Yen or Triss and both depict female breasts and don’t show the main act but show you as Geralt holding them closely. There is no Genitals but you can see a butt during the sex scenes, the only thing that may be good is that you can skip or say no to the sex scenes but I wouldn’t trust your young kid to be skipping those. It’s very iffy so if your kid is very mature than 15+ may be able to go down but if they aren’t. Wait on it.

The best game ever. Its okay for most 13 - 15 year olds
First this is the best game I have ever played, and I have played quite a lot. As for when someone should play it?. I think it depends, I think its okay for any 14 - 15 year old and any mature 12 - 13 year old. The sex stuff is relatively minor and comes up rather infrequently unless you are looking for it. The finishers that are the most gore intensive part can be turned off. So swearing is the most prominent problem. for people that have read or watched game of thrones or the witcher this is fine.

Great Fantasy Game
Such a great fantasy game, okay for kids fifteen and up, lots of graphic sex, and very graphic violence, and tons of language.

The Switcher 3
Personally my child was interested in this game because his friends at school were playing it at the time I own a pc so I tried it out to see if it was appropriate for his age (13) it does touch on dark subjects and sexual violence at times but skips over it rather quickly and moves onto the main plot there is nudity but it’s only breasts and buttocks which is a normal part of the human body and they which they will see at some point in there live sooner or later, and sex is normal reproduction so don’t pull your kid away from a narrative masterpiece such as this, there is blood and your character does look at dead bodies often mangled into pieces by a monster but it’s nothing worse than Skyrim to be fully honest don’t let the R rating scare you it’s nothing worse than your MA RPG game.

Frostpunk is a very fun and well made city building game- but it's not for younger kids.
This game is very good! It is very fun and interesting, and will make you sweat as you try and keep your city of New London alive! The one thing I will say is this game is NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS! If you can't handle: extremely depressing scenarios, suicide, cannabilism, murder, mass death, and anxiety, this is not for you. One of the most bleak and cold games I have ever played. Sorry, but your little Minecrafters shouldn't be on this game.

Challenging but Rewarding City Builder/Steampunk/Survival Game
Violence: Overall grim tone, some text references to death and violence. A handful of still images depict small amounts of blood. | Sex: One building that can be built is a brothel, however, nothing is shown and there's no descriptive dialogue either. | Language: Rare instances of "hell" and "f*ck" in text. | Drugs: Passing references to alcohol.

Frostpunk (now available on steam)
Game is very kid friendly, could be compared to games such as minecraft (but there are no zombies)

You start in the cold off with no shelter no food and many people. Make your own laws such as improving people's lives through making care homes for the physically disabled or even inventing new recipes to feed more people while using less materials.

Overall a good game with good challenges and never a boring moment.

This game can be really good for hand-eye coordination. I've played many different types of racing games. Such as Forza 5, and even Mario Kart. If you love to be competitive and want to work on your racing capabilities, then this would be a wonderful game to play. But I would say that it could be a bit violent at times. I suggest this game to people at and above the age 13 years old.

The series I love is BACK!
GRID has been absent for almost the entire PS4 and Xbox One era. Glad it came just in time. The races are back and better than ever. The score system in this game is literally get changing. The game uses vehicular violence more frequently than before. Some races start in an action packed slow mo, with either cars flipping or flying while you slide past them. Or you start the race with a gameplay cutscene where you've been pushed off the track and damaged a specific car part, drivers aren't seen hurt though.
