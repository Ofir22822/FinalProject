My child is 13 and for her birthday only wished for this game. Having heard of how bad call of duty can be I was very hesitant but I looked at the gameplay online and did a bit of research. The story mode can be a bit scary but in the settings, you can turn off blood and gore as well as profanity. the multiplayer had no disturbing scenes and was definitely not too much for 13 year olds. Overall the media has portrayed modern warfare as a gross scary game when really it just takes a bit of maturity and some changes in the settings to make it appropriate for all teens.

The game is essentially divided into a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign takes you through the story of anti-terrorists. The campaign alone should be 14+ due to some brutal scenes but with the gore and blood filter it becomes 13+ as it is mature for most kids. The reason the campaign isn't worse is because it makes you realise what's going on isn't good and that violence shouldn't be glorified. It is essentially like a 15 rated war film that is a lot less bloody if you want it to be as it portrays war as something brutal that shouldn't be enjoyed.

tHe multiplayer is a 11+ as there is little blood to no blood and noinappropriate scenes. As opposed to many stereotypes of Call of Duty it isn't as bad as media portrays it.

The next Call of Duty Game
This game has Blood, Decapitation, Main Purpose is killing people, You do interrogate people, lots of swearing, Cut scenes have some intense potentially scary violent acts. One of the badges you can get shows a person smoking weed. This game is a pretty fun game but kids shouldn't play it until they're 18.

Finally a CoD game worth buying
Multiplayer fine for ages 11+ but I’d wait until your kid is 13-14 to play campaign (Pretty gruesome and dark). This game is awesome the sound affects and detail are next to none. And it looks great on Xbox. Multiplayer is just fine for younger kids when you shot an enemy there is a little puff of blood but nothing crazy. Campaign can be dark at time and disturbing, but I think it was 100% worth it to include that content. The game has a more realistic feel.

Should be rated based on maturity
This game is pretty violent, and inappropriate all around. I would defenitly not let anyone under 13 play this game, but it might be ok to let a 13 year old play it. It really depends on their maturity. If you have a teen that cusses without you allowing them to, is really obsessed with guns (if they talk about murder or guns too much), or if they take drugs or do anything illegal don’t let them play. If they do none of these things, it’s completely fine to let a teen play. There are positive role models (not a lot) and lessons despite the very dark topic, and it’s better to learn about the real hard things as a kid than an adult. Do monitor your kids behavior just in case, but don’t take it away if they do one wrong thing. I’d personally say almost any kid should be able to play this, and parents need to really think hard about their kids maturity. But all in all, there’s tobacco/alcohol use, positive role models/lessons, some pretty heavy gore and cussing, but can really be a good game that deserves a different ESRB rating.

Should be fine for most 14 year olds and even some mature 13 year olds.
The violence isn't that gory, just very brutal.

Too Graphic.
Its way too graphic. For example: If you shoot someone the bullet hole stays there. And they bleed. Shooting unarmed women. Way too scary and graphic. Most certainly returning this back to game stop.

Great for kids
Any kid can play this. The violence has been exaggerated by media and your kid should play it.

TURN OFF BLOOD AND GORE AND EVERYTHING IS OK
Once you turn off blood and gore there are no limbs and legs flying off people. The only bad things is torture and that is very mild when you turn this setting on. The language is no worse than your child has heard in a movie or even at school.
Before I bought this for my son I played it myself and agreed he could play it if he said he would never do drugs or any of that stuff. I say this as one parent to another turn off blood and gore and it is not that bad.

Geez csm, back at it again with overating good games.... ( I mean age rating)
This game is amazing, the only issue might be the violence yet luckily there is a gore and profanity filter just in case if bloody visuals are too much, and to add on to that, this is an amazing game for people who have not tried the O.G Modern Warefare because this is the same game but with inhansed graphics and a gore filter.... Your 12 years old will love it!

Great game for young teens! Awesome storyline!
Here’s what I think about COD modern warfare.
To gamers,
I enjoyed the storyline thoroughly. Aside from WW2, I’d say it had the best storyline yet. Sadly it didn’t include zombies, which isn’t a surprise, after all I hope we all agree that COD BO4 zombies was terrible. The multiplayer wasn’t as good as BO1 or BO2, but it was much better than the last few multiplayer COD’s
For the parents,
The game is extremely violent, but I wouldn’t be terribly worried about it. Because if this is the first COD they ever had played, than I wouldn’t let them play it, I would make them play some of the older COD’s (for bloody graphics) . Aside from that, the storyline is dark. So for a child’s mind it might be a little much, but for a teen, it’s not bad. Overall, great game for YOUNGER TEENS.

Fun game as a parent I love to see my son having phone with this.
As long as you stay away from the campaign which is a story where you go through missions your fine. The blood in the game is barely visible and you don't see it.

Fine for kids 12 and up
This game is fine for kids 12 and up, as there is a blood and profanity/swearing option. The multiplayer is great,it opens up a whole new world in the modern warfare series. It’s fine even though it’s rated 18+ it shouldn’t be. I let my kids play this as I have spent quite a few hours myself playing the campaign. It’s fine!!

this game is not violent enough to be 18+ there is options for blood and profanity to be turned off and should be fine for a 10 year old however, my recommendation would be for 13+ because at this age children should be more than mature enough to play games such as COD Battlefield ect.

Its not that bad
Ive seen my 10 year old kid play it and its generally not that bad, theres some blood here and there and some dismemberment with some of the 50 cal weapons but its just another shooter game its not bad at all, although there is a bit much swearing in the campaign but its nothing a 10 year old cant handle.

multiplayer 12+ campaign 15+
the multiplayer can be disturbing for kids under 15 but i have watched my son play modern warfare and the game has a feature where you can turn off blood and swearing. To be honest the swearing is not as bad as some of the things they would be hearing in school anyway.

The 18 plus tag is simply a guideline for the campaign and doesn't really reflect the true nature of the game. I have been buying my son the annual call of duty for 2 years now and he is a good lad and loves playing with his friends.

I used to think this game was as bad as the ones i used to play (black ops 1, world at war) so i wouldn't usually let him play but as I saw some of the gameplay I realized it wasn't really that bad

If your child has the maturity to tell the difference between a game and real life
i think that he/she would enjoy playing this game
