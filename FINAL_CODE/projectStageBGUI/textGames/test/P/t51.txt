30. Terraria Released 2011 | Last position New entry Wes: I paid 10 bucks for Terraria nine years ago, played many hours of it, and was satisfied. It's surreal to go back to it in 2020, after its last (free) major update, to find the same compelling crafting and exploration expanded with literally thousands of items, massive bosses, and secrets I have to read a wiki to find. Those additions long ago distinguished Terraria from being a 2D Minecraft clone, but it's still staggering just how much awaits discovery in this humble-looking game. 29. Battletech Released 2018 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) Fraser: I could build mechs all day. There’s something very calming about putting together titanic killing machines. Sticking jetpacks on axe-wielding behemoths, swapping out piddly little lasers for armour-melting super cannons—it’s not a bad life. The battles are great, of course, but I’m always excited to get back to the garage so I can tweak my lance. Jorge: Battletech has everything I want, space politics, giant mechs, and the never-ending existential dread of trying to keep my band of mercenaries from going bankrupt. Evan: Post-launch updates filled in what was a somewhat shallow sandbox at launch, making Battletech a more varied campaign game. But what stands out two years later is the fundamental, pugilistic style of fighting that mechs promote as unique vehicles. Unlike the many zombies, helicopters, spiders, and goblins we fight in videogames, mechs can take a hit. The slow death that mechs experience, their bruises, their limps, their shattered limbs—it's a metallic boxing match that plays out over big battlefields. And like boxing, the knockdown and the knockout are the biggest moments. 28. League of Legends Released 2009 | Last position 26 (Image credit: Riot Games) Steven: League of Legends defined esports, but even 11 years on it also continues to be a ridiculously fun and challenging game. Recent changes in season 10 make matches even more dynamic and unpredictable in a good way, and Riot's aggressive balancing keeps the competition fierce. Fraser: I’ve played one game of League of Legends and that was enough for me. Teamfight Tactics, on the other hand, has somehow managed to get its hooks in me deep. I never make good builds, I can never find the characters I need, I get progressively more drunk and frustrated every time I play, and I love it. 27. Alien: Isolation Released 2014 | Last position 23 (Image credit: SEGA) Andy K: The best horror game on PC—and a pretty great stealth game too. Your alien adversary is unpredictable, dynamic, and adaptive, which makes it a terrifying thing to have stalking you from the shadows of Sevastopol. And the space station’s hard-edged sci-fi aesthetic, inspired by the 1979 movie, is to die for. Literally, if you spend too long standing around admiring it. Tom: I love the chunky bulkheads and spectacular lighting of the station. The Alien is still magnificent, of course, and it's still so refreshing to match wits with the huge, near-immortal Xenomorph from the first film. I think it overstays its welcome by a few hours, but that's a small complaint when the run up to the finale puts you through increasingly terrifying scenarios. Shout out to the Working Joes, the androids who give you something else to worry about when the Alien decides to go hunting elsewhere on the ship. 26. What Remains of Edith Finch Released 2017 | Last position 11 (Image credit: Giant Sparrow) Rachel: What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange, fantastical tales about the doomed Finch household. As the last living member, Edith has returned to the family home to discover her relative's hidden histories, exploring each of the family's many rooms to find out how each member met their unfortunate end. It's a first-person narrative adventure that tells surprisingly woeful vignettes in an artful and gentle way. Andy K: This is the only game I love that I’ll never play again. One moment in the story hit me so hard that I don’t think I can go through it again, and so that original playthrough will remain my first and last encounter with the game. But I still think anyone who values story in games should play it, because it tells its tale of an eccentric family in a wonderfully clever, elegant way. The Finch household is an incredibly evocative place too, stuffed with secrets and subtle details that help flesh the story out. Tom: There's something quite magical about Edith Finch's anthology of tragedies. It gets dark at times, but I came away strangely moved by the game's presentation of a strange family that lives in the weirdest house ever. The tag 'walking simulator' used to be an insult, but time and again we can see that it's a good format for storytelling. 25. Rainbow Six: Siege Released 2015 | Last position 16 (Image credit: Rainbow Six Siege) Harry: Rainbow Six Siege is both complex and beautifully simple. On the surface, all you need to do is capture/defend your objective, so beginners can quickly grasp the aim of the game, but veterans with thousands of hours clocked can still find plenty of ways to improve all the way up to professional level. With guns that can end your round with one bullet and hundreds of tactical micro decisions needing to be made during its many intense moments, I often need half an hour to calm down after a session. Recent new operators and revamps to some of its labyrinthine maps have been strong, too, but the battle against toxicity and bugs isn't over. Evan: Ubisoft deserves praise for sustaining a game like Siege with continuous meaningful updates despite not being a studio with a ton of institutional experience making competitive multiplayer games. Now a five-year-old FPS, Ubi continues to disrupt Siege's meta with experimental new operators (Iana, one of my recent favorites, spawns a holographic copy of herself that she can pilot around) while still making a lot of time to renovate big (and often boring-but-important) systems and old maps, demonstrated again very recently. 24. Persona 4 Golden Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Atlus) Robin: This iconic JRPG boasts all the usual tropes: dungeon crawls, turn-based battles, attacking and dethroning God, etc, but it’s in the mundane, not the supernatural, that it really grabs you. It’s got a wonderful sense of place, its Japanese countryside town utterly evocative and authentic as you progress through the seasons. What really sticks with you is its lovable cast of characters, a tight-knit crew of goofballs and misfits that form one of the most convincing and endearing friendship groups in games. Wes: Years before it was on PC I spent a good month playing Persona 4 in bed nearly every day, getting to know its great group of characters. The fanbase may overhype how truly interesting they all are, but the slow burn nature of Persona 4 lets you really live with them, and get to know them to a degree that few games can match, as you spend days just hanging out by the river talking, going shopping, or eating beef bowls. So many beef bowls. All the rest of the JRPG stuff is fun too, but really, Persona 4 is just a great teenage friendship simulator. 23. Return of the Obra Dinn Released 2018 | Last position 8 (Image credit: 3909) Wes: There's no better feeling than noticing some tiny detail—could that really be a clue?—and being rewarded by Obra Dinn's enthusiastic burst of music when properly guessing how one of these sailors met their grisly end. Just pay attention to everyone's shirt, is all I'm saying. Rachel: Lucas Pope's haunting detective game makes you witness things that have only existed in the gossip of sailors. Its bleached 1-bit visuals invite players to look a little closer before a chilling realisation sinks in. It's one of the best mysteries on PC, and if becoming an expert on all the different crew on a merchant ship from the 1800s sounds like fun, this is the game for you. Phil: I love talking about Obra Dinn with other players—discovering the slightly different ways we all came to the same conclusions. It's a clear sign of mastery when a mystery lets you arrive at difficult revelations from a number of different directions. 22. Total War: Three Kingdoms Released 2019 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Creative Assembly) Steven: Total War has explored several important historical periods, but none of them feel as fully realized as Three Kingdoms. That's because Three Kingdoms' emphasizes the characters that defined that era of Chinese history, making for a dramatic and fun strategy game with a lot of wonderful little flourishes and quirks. I love how factions are now defined by the personality of their leaders, like the conniving Cao Cao or the aging dignity of Liu Bao, and how that focus on personality also makes diplomacy actually matter over the course of a campaign. Instead of fighting faceless factions, you're sitting down with enemy generals with their own stories, motivations, and weaknesses, and it makes the battles feel all the more intense when they're the result of interpersonal conflict between warlords. Fraser: Right out the gate, Three Kingdoms was already a strong contender for the best Total War game, and since launch Creative Assembly have only added more to make it stand apart from the rest of the series. Expansions have introduced new campaigns that slot neatly into the regular campaign, fleshing out the timeline with more events and factions without making it feel bloated. The phenomenal campaign is now even better, then, with a greater variety of starting scenarios and a bunch of new factions with unusual mechanics. Even without that, though, you won’t find a more polished or better looking Total War. 21. Final Fantasy XIV Released 2013 | Last position 28 (Image credit: Square Enix) Steven: If there's one MMO you should play in 2020, FF14 is it. The latest expansion uses years of careful character development and world building to deliver a dimension-spanning gut-punch that rivals the series' best, and I really enjoy how FF14 tells such a coherent yet expansive story. But FF14 is just a joy to play. It's classes are distinct and fun, and dungeons and bosses are so unique and well-crafted that I don't mind running them over and over again for new gear. Tom: This game properly has its claws in me now. As a fan of Final Fantasy, it's great to see old archetypes return—it even has its own version of Biggs and Wedge. It takes ages to get going, but when I started hitting the dungeons at level 20 I knew I was in for the long haul. The malleable class system is great too, and I admire the way the game doesn't overwhelm you with skills before you've learned the purpose of your class. As a tank I successfully pulled a green dragon off puddles of poisonous goop as my companions battered it into submission. I felt like a hero.
20. Half-Life: Alyx Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Valve) Tyler: I don't like the horror aspects. I'm a wuss, and handling zombie corpses in VR makes me too nervous. Handling all other things with the Gravity Gloves, however, is fantastic. It's like you're Thor and everything is your hammer. Chris: Alyx doesn't really do anything groundbreaking when it comes to how you interact with the world in VR. It's interactions are super-satisfying, like Tyler said: using the grabbity gloves to pull things into your hands, reloading guns, examining objects. It all works great without feeling like anything particularly new. But where it's most impressive technically is how well it does locomotion and smooth movement. I've never had any real motion-sickness in VR, but I do get tired of it pretty quickly. I get headaches, I become hyper-aware of having controllers in my hands and a computer strapped to me face, and usually 30 minutes is as much as I can stand before I want to take off my headset for a break. I found Alyx so comfortable in VR that I had several sessions that lasted over two hours long, something I've never done in a VR game before. At no point did I feel like I needed a break or a breath. Whatever it does under the hood is incredibly impressive. And that's excellent because it's also incredibly engrossing. I was skeptical a game sandwiched between Half-Life 1 and 2 could do much story-wise, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. Half-Life: Alyx completely invigorated a storyline I've been invested in for over 20 years with some genuinely thrilling revelations. Emma: I suffer from motion sickness and I'm so grateful for the effort that Valve put in to make Alyx feel as comfortable as possible. As Chris mentions, it's so easy to sink a few hours into it without realising how long you've been playing. The story is incredible, and I'm excited to jump in for a second playthrough when the weather gets a little colder here in the UK—playing VR in this heat is horrible! 19. Into the Breach Released 2018 | Last position 6 (Image credit: Subset Games) Jody: Not even XCOM: Chimera Squad's missions are perfectly bite-sized like Into the Breach's snacky levels. Strategy games are usually life-devouring posture-killers. Not Into the Breach. Move mechs, trick giant insects into smacking into mountains, and you're done. One step closer to saving a world, time left to walk the dog. Evan: Snacky, as you say, but surprisingly grim! Ben Prunty's music and the tiny word bubbles emerging from the fragile buildings you're charged to protect convey a mood much bleaker than their bits. Mechanically and narratively Into the Breach is a textbook example of what can be achieved with a less-is-more approach. Phil: The way I play Into the Breach, it's almost like Sudoku for someone with a Steam account. I'll spend long minutes pondering a turn, staring at the screen while the real work plays out in my head. "If I move him there, I could… no, wait, because then… ah, but if…" It's a tactics game that tells you all of the terrible things that are about to happen, and lets you take the time to work out how to prevent them all. 18. The Sims 4 Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Electronic Arts) Chris: It'll cost an arm and a leg to keep up with all the expensive add-ons, but there's simply no other game quite like The Sims series. Whether you play casually or devotedly, it remains an utterly absorbing, occasionally morbid, often hilarious dollhouse, person simulator, and story generator. Katie Wickens: I know The Sims was originally designed as a middle-finger to consumerist culture and has now contorted into the very thing it despised, but I can't help getting sucked into the intricate slew of home and garden design features. The building cheats and extensive modding community make this game one of my all time favorites. So many stories to be woven, mysteries to be uncovered, crimes to be solved. This game has it all. Still, I’d wait for a sale before you spend your life savings on it. Emma: I'm a long-time fan of the Sims, but I try to stop myself from playing it too often as it's ridiculously easy for me to become addicted to it all over again. One thing I'm still terrible at is looking after pets, though. My beautiful pink pugs always run away. 17. Apex Legends Released 2019 | Last position 24 (Image credit: EA, Respawn Entertainment) Phil: For the longest time I thought battle royales weren't for me. Apex Legends changed that, by encouraging me not to hide away like a coward, but to embrace the speed, maneuverability and lethality of its design and go looking for a fight. I'm a convert—I've already logged 180 hours since March, and I won't be stopping anytime soon. Jacob: There are few games I'd take in lieu of Titanfall 3, but Apex Legends is a worthy replacement. It completely reshaped my opinion of battle royales up until that point, which were often long drawn-out exercises in scavenging up until a rogue sniper sends you back to the lobby. Apex Legends offered fast-paced action, a tighter map (which breadcrumbs gear and points of interest any which way you go), team respawns, superb gunplay, an inventory system that doesn't suck—you name it, Apex Legends had it, and has been improving on ever since. Emma: Apex Legends has become part of my daily routine. Every night after dinner I'll clock in to grind through a few more battle pass challenges. Each season has introduced viable new legends, as well as interesting changes to the map, such as the bunkers in Season 5. I'm also enjoying the fact that Respawn are continuing to drip feed the characters' backstories into the game, too. The week that Forge was announced before being brutally killed by Revenant felt like a dramatic, twisted soap opera, and I'm all for more drama. What's most impressive about Apex is how long it's managed to retain my attention for so long, and how every season feels like its best yet. Season 6 just introduced crafting, and it really helps to alleviate some of the boring downtime of other battle royales. I've also become a Rampart main for the time being, and have even gravitated towards entirely different weapons this season. I can't wait to see what Respawn adds next. 16. Yakuza 0 Released 2018 | Last position 15 (Image credit: Sega) Jorge: You come to Yakuza 0 for the Japanese '80s crime drama, but you'll stay for the over-the-top fights and wholesome character moments as you try to improve the lives of the citizens of Kamurocho. Also, seeing the series' beloved protagonists, Kiryu and Majima, in their awkward 20s struggling to figure out what kind of men they want to be is surprisingly relatable. Andy K: The origin story of Majima Goro, as told in Yakuza 0, is honestly one of the best storytelling experiences a game has ever given me. His early chapters, where he’s working as the manager of a cabaret club in Osaka, are incredible: particularly his introduction, where he deals with a drunk customer using nothing but extremely good manners, soundtracked by a swing band. You’ll know what I mean when you see it, and you should, because this is an exceptionally entertaining game set in a dense, vivid portrayal of 1980s Japan. It breakdances on the line between absurd and serious in a really masterful way, and it’s the perfect introduction to a truly one-of-a-kind series. Phil: The series has slowly been making its way to PC—Remastered Collection when, Sega?—but, if you've never played one before, Yakuza 0 is the place to start. It's a prequel, which helps, but more importantly it's the absolute apex of the series' drama, humour and social commentary, embodying its '80s with singular dedication. What I'm saying is: the money flies out of people when you punch them. 15. Hitman 2 Released 2018 | Last position 9 (Image credit: IO Interactive) Fraser: You can kill someone with a homing suitcase. Phil: You can! And it's the reason Hitman 2 is one of the most satisfying stealth games around. Look behind the thematic window dressing of a stoic assassin causing trouble in a series of neighbourhoods and you'll realise that Hitman 2 is a procession of puzzle boxes built on rigidly consistent rules. You're rewarded for discovering and manipulating those rules—learning how the sandbox will react and tailoring your approach to exploit it. It's a rare and beautiful game where breaking your own sense of immersion makes for a more mechanically enjoyable experience. Andy K: I love walking slowly through one of Hitman 2’s impossibly dense maps, looking for cracks in the security to infiltrate, disguises to change into, people to follow, and targets to kill. These moments, the calm before the storm, are what make the series special for me. The planning, the anticipation, and, naturally, the on-the-fly changes of plan as you make a mistake and chaos erupts around you. It also helps that the levels look so beautiful. IO Interactive’s environment designers are some of the best in the business, and Hitman 2 is a killer showcase for their talents. The Isle of Sg?il is a personal highlight: a crumbling old castle perched on a rain-battered island in the North Atlantic, playing host to a creepy secret society party straight out of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. 14. Doom Eternal Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Bethesda) Wes: Doom Eternal spikes my adrenaline so hard I'm exhausted after an hour. If you've ever pondered the videogame equivalent of slamming a 16 oz. Monster Energy, then juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle across a burning rope suspended over a hellmouth, well, here you go. Harry: Doom Eternal's frantic relentlessness is exactly what I'm looking for in a shooter. Juggling resources and living every second on the edge of death is a great way to unwind and few other games require quite the same undivided, hysterical concentration. While Eternal didn't change enough to give it the impact the 2016 reboot did, it didn't really need to. That intoxicating cocktail of hardcore metal, intricate map design, and gruesomely cathartic glory kills is as exhilirating as ever, in necessarily short bursts. James: Doom 2016 is still great! Go play that if you want to breathe between headshots, if you want to remain fully conscious and aware while ripping up demons and sticking it to the man (the man is hell). But Doom Eternal is a vastly different experience. Doom 2016 wants you to feel cool and sweat a bit. Doom Eternal kept me in a lizard-brained panic, balanced precariously between frenzy and despair, an FPS automaton of pure instinct for 15 damn hours. It's a painful, cleansing experience. Doom Eternal aged me. 13. Kentucky Route Zero Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: cardboard computer) Rachel: Cardboard Computer took seven years to release all five episodes of Kentucky Route Zero, and yet it was worth the wait. This evocative adventure about the struggles of rural America are more relevant today than ever. Kentucky Route Zero is an anthology of stories from the road, tales of lore and mythos intertwined with the tough truths of working class folk. Miners, electricians and store clerks take centre stage telling stories of survival during economic hardship. The magical-realism enhances these tales and, as dreamlike as it can be, Kentucky Route Zero stays firmly grounded in respect for its characters. It's a powerful story that conjures a damning portrait of America and those who are forced to wander its lost highways. 12. XCOM 2 Released 2016 | Last position 13 (Image credit: 2K) Wes: XCOM 2 sticks around year after year because it's such an endlessly flexible sandbox, but the Chosen, stars of its must-have expansion, really make it for me. They're nasty, vengeful alien commandos who show up to make your life hell time and again. They made me miserable, but in return I tracked them to their hideouts and relished the chance to finish them off after so much torment. Evil's just more fun to fight when it has a face you can punch. Robin: I reviewed XCOM 2 back when it came out, and honestly I’ve never really stopped playing it. All its different layers of randomness—especially with the expansion and some choice mods—just make it endlessly replayable for me. It’s this big, intricate, shifting puzzle that I never get tired of unpicking. 11. Planescape: Torment Released 1999 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Beamdog) Jody: I first played Dungeons & Dragons in the 1990s, before it got cool or had rules that were good. Even then Planescape was a wildly imaginative setting—a multiversal city run by squabbling philosophy gangs. Torment takes that setting and emphasises its urban grottiness, with magic tattoos instead of platemail and charms made of flies. The heroes are scuffed-up too. There's a thief who is part-demon and voiced by Sheena Easton, a pyromancer who is punished for lighting fires with eternally burning skin, and you, an amnesiac corpseman who wakes up in a morgue. D&D can be fun when it's elves and dwarves, but it's even better when you're a man who drinks embalming fluid instead of healing potions.
