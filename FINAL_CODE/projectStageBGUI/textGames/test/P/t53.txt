Personal Picks We love many more games than we can fit onto one list, so here the PC Gamer team has spotlighted a few of their favorites that didn't make the cut. James Davenport: Hylics 2 (Image credit: Mason Lindroth) As a Wayne of some importance, it's up to you to stop the reconstitution of Gibby so everyone can get back to slapping bugs. I'm still not sure what Hylics 2 is about, but that's kind of OK. An absurdist RPG made of 3D-scanned clay models, it plays like a long-lost RPG from the 1970s. Harry Shepherd: Journey (Image credit: Thatgamecompany) thatgamecompany's wordless wonder has long been my favourite videogame, and last year it finally found its definitive home on PC. Enhanced by a majestic score from Austin Wintory, this entrancing two-hour epic sees you floating over undulating sand dunes and sweeping through dank caves to reach a twinkling mountain peak. Pint-sized perfection. Phil Savage: Guild Wars 2 (Image credit: ArenaNet) Its combat is punchy and satisfying, its community is helpful and engaged, and its approach to levelling makes it easy to get involved in any of its regular updates—even if you haven't played for years. So many live service games would be improved if they took some inspiration from Guild Wars 2's model. Rachel Watts: If Found... (Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) Dreamfeel's coming-of-age visual novel has both beautiful and gut-wrenching authenticity. It follows a trans woman's return to her Irish hometown during the '90s, having to deal with the troubles of being a young queer adult. It's an ethereal story of awkward crushes, punk concerts, and a black hole that threatens to destroy reality. Chris Livingston: West of Loathing (Image credit: Asymmetric) RDR2 isn't the only open world cowboy game on PC. West of Loathing's art may just be simple stick figures, but the writing is brilliant and it's overstuffed with jokes. I played long after I'd finished the RPG's main quest, just to make sure I'd found every last scrap of humor. Robin Valentine: Mortal Kombat 11 (Image credit: Warner Bros.) Not just the only fighting game with a genuinely good story campaign, but for my money the most accessible entry into the genre there’s ever been. Easy combos, a slower pace, and a whole suite of fantastic tutorials make this a gory showdown that anyone can enjoy. Err, unless you’ve got a weak stomach. Andy Kelly: L.A. Noire (Image credit: Team Bondi) Rockstar's most divisive game is also one of my favourites. This lavish replica of 1940s Los Angeles is a dream for anyone who's ever watched a film noir or read a Raymond Chandler novel and wished they could be there. And a cast of genuinely great actors (including several familiar faces from Mad Men) really brings the story to life. Jacob Ridley: Florence (Image credit: Annapurna Interactive, Mountains) Florence is a snapshot of falling in, and drifting out of, love. It's delivered through simple interactions—each puzzle is intrinsically tied to Florence's thoughts and feelings. But even beyond its affirming story, Florence offers a vibrant art style brought to life by a wonderful soundtrack filled to the brim with light and intricate piano and cello motifs. Alan Dexter: Magic the Gathering: Arena (Image credit: Wizards of the Coast) What's that? MTG Arena isn't on the list? An oversight surely. If you want to exercise your grey matter there isn't a game that comes close. I've been playing the cardboard version for over 20 years and this is the best digital version by a country mile. The fact I still play daily is surely all the recommendation needed. And no, you don't need to drop any cash on it to enjoy it. Fraser Brown: The Beginner's Guide (Image credit: Everything Unlimited Ltd) An analysis of some levels from the perspective of a designer and fan, The Beginner's guide is a fascinating exploration of game design that becomes something so much more. It's insightful and uncomfortable and—actually, I'm going to leave it there. It's brilliant and you should find out for yourself. Wes Fenlon: Satisfactory It's really all in the name. Even incomplete in Early Access, this factory building sim is so damn satisfying in how it lets you optimize designs, then sit back and watch your elaborate construction whir with life. God I love building things that build things that build things that build... Dave James: Football Manager (Image credit: Sports Interactive) There is always a longterm FM career going on my home PC, and stored in the cloud so I can access whenever, from wherever. It's my comfort, my happy place, even when it's making me more angry than a bunch of little computer people have any right to. It's also the best RPG going. Fight me. Jody Macgregor: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Image credit: spike) The best game inspired by the movie Battle Royale is an extended parody of Phoenix Wright where gifted kids are trapped by a robot bear (just roll with it), and forced to murder each other. Only the killer who evades guilt in a class trial goes free. It's a comedy. Tom Senior: Mortal Shell (Image credit: Playstack) Dark Souls is an enigmatic game, but the soulslike Mortal Shell manages to be even more obscure. You play a pale spirit who can occupy the forms of four fallen warriors, each with their own skills and strange backstories. Fantastic combat and the innovative Shell system sets it apart from the games that inspired it.
