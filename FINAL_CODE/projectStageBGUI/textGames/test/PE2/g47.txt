Honestly not bad
The battle Royale game mode warzone is definitely a 13+ not bad at all however you can turn off all violence and language which I believe is suitable for anyone at all

Its not fun at all
it is cool that you can get resurrected after a fight in the gulag but that should happen frequently. It comes all down to the player that picked up the gun first and with no orientation whatsoever that is pretty hard if you are not experienced with the map i did put that to test and die ... continue reading

not as bad as you think
When you hear the title 'Call of Duty' you probably assume it's too violent for kids, but in this version that's not the case. before letting my son play this, i thought i would try it out for myself first. apart from some blood when you shoot someone there is no extreme gore or violence ... continue reading

So good
It’s a great game. I was really strict with my kids going on it but now looking back I don’t know why I was. It’s a great game and if your kids have common sense and work properly at school and do well you should reward them and guess what it’s free as well

Kids are perfectly fine playing this game.
The main game of Call of Duty Modern Warfare is boring itself. But the Warzone mode allows players to get creative.

OK for kids 14+
I have a 13 year old and a 10 year old child. My wife told me that I should try it out, then my 13 year old. The come to a conclusion for .y 10 year old. It was OK at first until I could turn off the gore and it was The BEST GAME. Kids will love for this.

The restrictions are false for this game!!!!!!
I have two kids that are at each others necks every second. This game separates them I'm surprised of how little blood is in an M rated game.

Amazing game for Battle Royal Lovers
This game connected with my daughter immediately. She was in love with the amount of detail they put in. She said her favorite part is the little amount of gore and blood.

It's ok for teens
There is swearing and a bit of blood but nothing teens haven't seen or heard before
If your child is sensible enough not to go out and do this stuff in real life it should be ok for your child.
