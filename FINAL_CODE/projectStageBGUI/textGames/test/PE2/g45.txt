 
OK
For the record, you CAN NOT turn off blood. You can turn off gore, but there are still dead bodies with bloodstained shirts. Its an OK game but its nothing special. It's like any other BR game I ever played. There is is also some banners that have F**K on them.

Call Of Duty Warzone
Call Of Duty Warzone is an easy to play game that resembles Fortnite. You can change settings to disable blood and other combat related graphic moments. If these setting are in place it is a great game that many people will enjoy. You can play with your friends or on your own. There are multiple game modes such as a campaign game mode and Battle Royale. There is some cursing in the campaign mode but in the Battle Royale mode there is no cursing unless you are playing with your fiends on a team and one of them curses. The game is free to play and a great game for kids 9 and up.

Stop being overprotective
Warzone is all about strategy in working with your teammates to help them win the match. It may have blood but most kids have already seen it in movies and you could also turn it off I am 10 years old and I play Love cod. If I and all the other kids Can handle It. And your kid too

Fit for a 13+
Warzone is an excellent, outstanding game. Yes the game does feature some graphic images, but wouldn’t affect a teen harshly. This game also teaches real life lessons and puts you in tactical situations to make you understand more about real life operations and scenarios. If you are uncomfortable with your child or teen playing the game, its understandable, but there are setting to turn off blood, gore, and language if that makes you feel more comfortable. The game also teaches you important social skills like teamwork. Overall I believe its a great game and fit for a mature child/teen.

It isn't that bad for kids to play
Although there is blood and use of drugs sometimes you can easily go to settings and turn off swears and blood and because there is a lot of interaction with players using microphones you might want to turn off yours and others players too.

Great Battle Royale Expansion to an excellent game
This game is the free to play expansion of Modern Warfare (2019) The scenarios in the game include various gun fights, shoot outs and the ability to use grenades which explode the enemies. When shot there is a blood splatter and enemies lay there with blood nearby and do not "disappear" like other battle royale. When shot your screen goes red indicating blood. Some guns have the ability to dismember enemies but you can turn off this in settings. Many characters curse profusely and some announcers curse when talking about the Gulag and more events. All in all this expansion is not as gory or graphic as the main game and its campaign and is great fun with friends.

Depends What Kind Of Kid
If you’re reading reviews to find out what age your kid should play Call Of Duty Warzone, you’ve come to the right place. I think it really depends on how your child is with video games, because this game can get addicting. You can level up your weapons to make them better, which takes a very long time to do and is addicting to unlock all of the sights and other things for all the weapons. With custom settings on you can turn off all gore which means that there is no dismemberment and no chunks of human flying when they explode, but there is still blood although it is very minor. Blood splatters on wall behind person you shoot, and there is always a puff of red when you shoot someone but when you’re in far combat, it is hard to see. Cars and helicopters can be used as weapons I’ve never seen blood from being ran over, but when a helicopter hits you it makes a splat sound and you see a blood pool where you once were. Swearing is not bad in this game, and most of it comes from people playing the game which is also called game chat, which you can turn off. Ok, that is all the game really has, I thinks it gets repetitive at times, thanks for reading.

amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
call W isn't the regular call it's not as bloody as the regular call, it's technically Fortnite or apex. Battel royal with no animated graphics or half-animated real graphics, it's straight-up real graphics. Speaking of graphics, call's graphics are amazing !!!!!!!!!!
I hope this review was interesting.

Not that bad
Again, explaining what I tell users on this site, for most FPS, they may cause addiction, and more or less cause them to rage over the game because they can’t win or something similar. As long as the player is mature enough, I’d say go right ahead unless you are concerned. With being mature, gamers know how to deal with stress from games they play, and how to keep themselves cool. They know when to take a break, and that just because they need to “clutch that win” or “having fun” doesn’t mean they HAVE to keep playing. Mature gamers know that real life comes first, and even if getting offline isn’t easy, they take up that burden, and return to the real world. Heck, some mature gamers as young as 12-13 can just shrug off anything inappropriate such as blood, gore, or extreme language and not react as if someone had just whispered a dirty joke in their ear.

If your gamer knows these points, they’re ready for pretty much any game they want. Just fiddle around with chat filters and such if you dont want your gamer hearing that stuf. Have a good rest of your day my dear reader.

Not for squeakers
Not suitable for 14 and under due to brutal executions. People in game chat use profanity and that is acceptable as it is an 18. If you will get annoyed with your kid getting cussed don't get the game.

Not Bad
this game is made out much worse than it is.
when you shoot someone the blood is not realistic at all and the character will just fall on the floor. there is the occasional swearing but i’m pretty sure you can turn it off.

CoD: Warzone
If your kid has played other battle royale games (Fortnite, PUBG, Apex Legends, etc.), this should be completely fine for them. There are several tutorials on the different modes of CoD: Warzone to help along the way. Unlike other battle royale games, there is also a Pillage mode (or Blood Money) where you try to kill people to collect the most money. You can collect many skins through missions for free.

MW was built for a well done Battle Royale game
This free to play Battle Royale version of MW is one of the best if not fun Battle Royale game. The mechanics suit the action in the game mode. Violence is present and frequently strong. Use of a large variety weapons ranging from Pistols and handguns, to LMG's and Snipers. With blood on: successful hits from weapons result in big puffs of blood and a bit of blood spurts that contain gore. Blood can stain the environment, but is present for long (unless the blood stains were built into the map). With blood off: Mild blood is still sometimes present but no gore is seen or bloodstains. Blood is harder to see. Strong language is occasionally heard. Before you start the official match, you'll hear the announcer say "Alright, enough f#!king around..." Some characters swear when knocked down or killing someone. Example, character Yegor when he instantly kills someone: "F#!K YOU!" Other characters make use of the word "$h!t" Gambling and consumerism is also present but more frequent if you own the free to play version. Season passes are always up for purchase. If you own the free to play version, then the normal game is also up for purchase, the original version and deluxe version.
