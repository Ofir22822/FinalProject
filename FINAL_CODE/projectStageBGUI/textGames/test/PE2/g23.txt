Great for ages 10+
I came here thinking I was going to get a copy of the original. Turns out it was nothing like the original! Sure it has the original SUPERHOT essence, but there are new enemies, power ups, and plot. If you haven't played the SUPERHOT series yet, you're missing out on a lot!

Original was better, still good.
A nice extension of the original Super Hot game. The graphics are better and now we have all these new types of enemies, like enemies with only a small part you can damage and enemies that explode with bullets when killed. There are also rare unkillable enemies that show up sometimes, I know there are three, though I’ve only discovered one so far. The story is okay, very similar in theme to the original game, with the game displaying ominous and slightly disturbing messages. There are these weird nodes where you walk through this building, it’s always the same building, with no enemies save for the first time you enter it, and the game continually tries harder to stop you and discourage you. Much like the original, you are also prompted to destroy a figure who seems to represent you. There are weird messages and stuff there as well, in between completing nodes. The game itself is ok, it starts to feel a bit repetitive as so far there is a relatively small pool of levels that are randomly plucked out and put into nodes. There are added game mechanics that appear to keep it fresh, like additional enemy types and weird exploding things, as well as “hacks” you find in caches inside the game, that you can activate in nodes to give you boosts. However, the original game requires more skill and thought. You would start each level in a set location, with enemies specifically set up so that you have to work out the best way to kill them. Now it’s really just you’re thrown into an arena with a bunch of red guys, and killing 7-10 of them completes the level. This system has sort of removed much of the challenge from a game, the only real challenge you need to overcome now is trying not to do anything wrong. It also contains mild swearing, though infrequent.

The 2nd most inovative shooter I've played in years
I loved the original game and played it for, well to many hours. The second game is just as good as the original if not a little better, though a bit more violent, due to the fact that there are things like knifes and bad guys getting empaled by records and such, but it's not that violent, the bad guys are glass holograms that shatter, NO BLOOD.
Thoughts on the story is that it's just a lure filled and spooky as the original game I haven't finished it yet, but I'm loving the storyline so far, tho there is some language so far all I've seen is s***hole, other than that I would say 11+, if I could leave with one thing on the story that would be, it's over, you shouldn't be here.

Fantastic and not inappropriate
Amazing game no blood can turn off voice chat completely safe for kids.

Good game, a refreshing challenge
If you are looking for a general over view: This game is fun, action pact and requires skill. There is less grinding required. Fully suitable for young ones if they have quick reaction times and decent third person knowledge.

Rocket arena is a super fun 3rd person shooter game about rockets. In this game, you are thrown into an arena with 5 other people, 2 being your teammates, and your goal is to throw the enemies out of the arena to win.
FUN:I have played many shooters during my time in gaming, and none of them are like this game. It's an interesting, unique premise that is executed well. There are different characters to choose from, so you don't need to worry about the gameplay getting repetitive. It takes basic 3rd person shooters and combines them with the fun percent system from smash brothers and creates a refreshing experience.
MICROTRANSACTIONS: Being an EA game, there are mircotransactions, but they chose to remove the idiotic loot box system and instead let you earn money in game and buy skins with that in game money. The rate of monitary gain is good too, so you don't have to grind super long for the item you want. another thing i like is they decided to make almost all the characters available from the start, meaning you get to skip most of the grinding and can go right into play.
GAMEMODES: Speaking of play, there are 4 gamemodes, each with their fun aspects. The first mode is knockout, which is a more traditional kill to win type mode, but with a rocket arena twist, that being you need to knock your opponents out of the stage, similar to smash brothers. This twist continues throughout all the gameplay. The next mode is Mega Rocket, which is a CTF(Capture the flag) style gamemode. Nothing too special. The next gamemode is Treasure Hunt. This gamemode has two phases. The first is you need to try to hold onto a treasure chest, collecting coins as you go. The second phase is you need to collect coins scattered around the map. Keep in mind this is all while being shot at. The last gamemode is Blast Ball, which is essentially football.
SKILL: This game is challenging when you first start playing. All of the abilities are geared to the characters play style and you don't always like the play style of a certain character, which results in a loss most of the time. Also, most of the rockets you fire are slow in comparison to most shooters, so you will have to get used to all of your shots having some sort of lag. Every character in this game has some sort of movement ability which makes them more maneuverable witch will make it more challenging to hit them. Also, height plays a big role in this game. Lots of characters have the ability to get very high, and you will have to be looking all around your character to make sure you don't get ambushed by a roaming plink(A character) who may be tailing you. This requires good game sense. However, once you learn these skills you will be able to secure lots of KOs and be useful on you team, which is rewarding.
IS THIS GAME SAFE FOR KIDS: Yes. You don't have to worry about your kid seeing strange things in this game, as it is perfectly safe if your kid has watched any kind of cartoon violence.

Fun exciting game that has no killing! It's called instead K.O./Knockout
This is a third person game, not like Fortnite. It's less violent, I think they made the game really well. It's fun, quick, and easy...a great game it's in it's own category from any other game!

3 Stars? What the carp?
This game is absolutely golden and is a great expansion of the original Catherine. How ever it is definitely more mature than most Atlus games.

Fun but risque puzzler
No explicit sex or nudity but alot of provocative imagery and talk. Cartoonishly bloody violence. Characters are often stereotypes but it ultimately paints a funny satirical picture of entitled dudebro perception of relationships. Puzzle sequences are challenging and intense.

Helps build problem solving skills
Firstly, it's a great game. It's engaging, fun, and overall well put together. It's a bit scary being all alone, and sometimes the ambiance can make it scarier. One part in the game, there's a chalkboard with an agenda for the week, and it reads: Murder, Murder, Murder, Murder, Murder, Murder, Beans. There is a blood trail, but it's not graphic and you could easily miss it. You can become pretty frustrated playing it, but if you are smart, you'll be fine. From a parent's point of view, 9+ should be able to play it without a problem besides frustration. Helps kids (and adults) overcome problems and think strategically.
 
Childhood Memories
I played the original 2003 version when I was a kid on my PS2. I had great times with the game. Later on in the future, I sold my PS and all my Games. I regret that choice to this day. But now that the remastered version is out, I don’t have to think about my mistake. This is a great game overall and would recommend it to all ages. I don’t understand why Game Critics are giving this game so much hate. So if your a fan of spongebob, or just want to try the game for yourself, go ahead! It’s worth every dime.

An Amazing Game!
I love this games, it has a great story and multiplayer! The games is an open world platformer with great level design and a gorgeous world! There is very little violence, you sometimes have to wack a robot with a few different objects but the robots just fall apart and disappear. There is no language or inappropriate jokes. This game plays great looks great and is great, I highly recommend it!

This is the best remaster ever
I played the original on the ps2 and i really enjoyed it. The remaster however is just as incredible. Although it may be a bit hard for younger audiences (5 and below) it is a good challenging game to put a few hours of play into.

Absolute Banger for all the family
I saw my son playing this and i was immediatly enlightened. It really opened my mind up to what life could be. I have recently quit my job as a neurologist and am now speed running this game. I feel happier than i have ever been. I would completley with all my heart recommend this game to any other familys and I hope that you can reap as much enjoyment out of it as i have.
