New tricks will make the headlines, but Sports Interactive's best move is to breathe new life into the brilliance that's already there.

With a newfound litheness on the pitch and deep data analysis, FM21 gives you an easy excuse to relapse.

Football Manager 2021 may not revolutionise the series, but instead it adds countless quality-of-life improvements – including ones to the match engine – that make it the best Football Manager game to date.

Football Manager 2021 is the best episode ever of the series on the pitch, where the experience is nearly perfect in terms of simulation, while off the pitch the game has really a clumsy and obnoxious user interface. Overall, the experience is great and the football world feels tense, realistic and dynamic as never before, but there's still more room to improve the game in terms of narration, flow and emotional storytelling.

Football Manager 2020 is another confirmation of Sports Interactive's ability in crafting a great title every year. No revolution is to be expected, but many smaller improvements bring the game ever closer to technical perfection. FM 2021 is clean and optimized, probably also thanks to the fact that the game will also release on Xbox One and Series X|S.

Football Manager 2021 is by far the closest representation to the beautiful game you can find. With an improved matchday engine, improved AI and even more datapoints than ever before, all represented in a more digestible method, making it more accessible than ever before. However, there's still no doubt that the series is still going to have a high barrier to entry, and it has some irritating issues, such as repetition in the press conferences and other interaction aspects. Issues aside, this is yet another improvement and superior entry to the series.

I’m still working my way through my first season at the helm of the semi-pro Bath City FC (a team I’ve chosen as a way to connect with my coworkers in PCGamesN’s hometown), and so there’s still more I’d like to see before assigning a score – particularly, the initial patch that updates the beta build I’ve been playing. But my impressions of Football Manager 2021 so far are largely positive. This is a clear step forward over last year’s edition, even if some of its new ideas don’t completely work.

With Football Manager 2021, Sports Interactive have once again delivered a game that countless fans will happily be pouring hundreds of hours of their lives into.

On their own, all of these things would have been significant improvements over the Zombies modes from the recent past. But when added together, they feel like a massive leap forward for the whole mode. By streamlining the overly complicated mechanics this time around, Treyarch is placing the focus back on the mode’s bread and butter: killing zombies.

The single-player and campaign modes are actually really great stuff. But like nearly all Call of Duty games, that is the content you'll breeze through within your first week playing if even for just a few hours a day. The bulk of the ride ends up being multiplayer and zombies and that is where the problems really lie. This is a game that I'm sure will eventually get the extra content, balancing, and bugs worked out along a series of patches and end up being much better than it is today. But unfortunately the buggy, laggy, unbalanced, and content-sparse game we get at launch is the only one I was given to review. And the balance of the excellent single-player with below average multiplayer ends up for an average overall experience.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes you back to the past, not only in setting and theme, but in its gameplay style and more. It all feels so classic. Between multiplayer, Zombies, and the return of a proper (and surprisingly less-linear) campaign, there is plenty of value for the soldier in all of us.

Probably the safest entry in the series of late, it's fairly safe to say that if you like Call of Duty games then you'll most likely enjoy what Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has to offer. The performance issues on PS5 are more than a little frustrating, although when things are running smoothly and those haptics are firing off beneath your fingers then there is a lot of enjoyment to be found, with the caveat being that there just isn't any discernible innovation at play here.

Black Ops is back and darker than ever. With a rich story and plenty of super-spy moments, this game keeps you gripping down on your controller. Always going to be compared to past titles, this iteration stands up to the challenge and delivers a whole new experience on what a Call of Duty title should be.

There’s a lot to enjoy here, and if you’re a person who’ll just check out the game in your free time versus grinding it for hours on end, you’ll like it. If you are somebody who likes to dedicate whole days to playing CoD with your friends, then you might quickly find yourself wanting to find something else to play.

While I wouldn’t call myself a Call of Duty enthusiast in any shape or form, I can say for sure that I’ve enjoyed playing through each of the entries that I’ve gotten to review over the years. Compared to 2019’s Modern Warfare, I would say that I’m having more fun this year mostly due to the time period that it takes place in and how closely it sticks to the flavor of movies I grew up watching. It’s ridiculous, all over the place and surely dumb, but at the end of the day, a fun ride. Just try and don’t take anything about it too seriously.

Another year, another Call of Duty. And the first of the new generation of consoles. We return to a spectacular and vibrant campaign with grateful adventure additions, along with a solid, direct and full multiplayer, full of game modes and content that will increase as the 'season' passes. Hours and more hours in front of the screen to which the insertion of Wargame within the same game is added to make the multiplayer experience more complete.

From Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s extremely flashy, yet ultimately shallow, campaign; through to its back-to-basics multiplayer offerings and reimagined Zombie modes, the game is great. While multiplayer is very subjective it is easy to see Cold War’s multiplayer becoming the next benchmark for frantic battles and firefights among friends and online communities. The game also looks incredible and loads like a breeze. For the first time in a long time, there is a Call of Duty game worthy of the attention it has received in the weeks leading up to its release. It may not be a profound title challenging personal philosophies, but it is most definitely worth playing even if just for its single-player narrative.

Don’t worry if you think that Cold War veers too far off from that exhilarating element of Call of Duty you have grown up with, it is still there in heaps!
