 
This is probably the best game i have ever played but it is very violent.
Lets start off by saying that this game is really great but also very violent. In one of the missions you are a CIA agent and you have to disguise as a terrorist and kill a large crowd of innocent civilians but you are able to skip this level as an option in the menu. This game does not have a lot of blood but that does not take away the fact that the game is violent with shooting, stabbing, punching, whipping, and much more. Some good things about the game is that most of the time you are apart of some sort of counter terrorism unit that fights for Justice. Parents before you buy your child this game please make sure that they are mature and are able to handle stressful scenes, shooting people, and explosions, I hope this helped!

10+ should be fine
First of all, some of the adult reviews aren’t true. You don’t take meth at all. This game is a classic. I played it when I was younger, and am very happy that it is remastered. The game features a lot of violence. There is a mission where you shoot up an airport. You don’t have to fire any bullets and you can easily skip the mission ( a warning appears stating that sensitive content is ahead, and you may skip if you wish without any penalty). You can turn off blood in the settings. There is a scene where the character is stabbed in the chest, pulls the knife out, and throws it into an enemy soldiers eye to save a teammate. There is a scene where your character is shot, and you watch as the enemy pours gasoline on your body. A fire starts, but you don’t see any gore or anything bad, just harrowing music as your comrades call out for you on the radio. If you turn off blood it basically becomes airsoft.

Depends on the child
If the child has seen war movies, it’s pretty standard, if they are sensitive to gunfire, lots and lots of killings and language, hard pass. But if your child has seen avengers, it’s pretty fine I guess. The story is great! If a little vulgar. The role models are amazing as well. So it depends on the child, but I think It’s a 13+ game.

Remastered classic is still fun, but still shows its age in gameplay.
Modern Warfare 2 Remastered contains the singleplayer campaign only. The story and narrative of Modern Warfare 2 is memorable with likeable characters. Gameplay shows its age in terms of level design and gameplay pillars.

Violence is frequent and occasionally graphic. Most of the time you'll be shooting waves of enemies during gameplay and entertaining set pieces. One mission (that you are able to skip) has you play as an undercover CIA agent working with a terrorist in an airport attack where the rest of the crew kills thousands of civilians (you can too, but you are able to progress without shooting any civilians). One sequence has you being stabbed in the chest, pulling out and throwing into an eye of a character. Blood sprays and spurts are present and occasional throughout the game.

Language is occasional and mostly moderate. Use of "b!#ch", "$h!t" and "blood hell" are heard. One use of "f#!king" is heard.

One Of The Best Games.
This game, while it can be violent is very good. You can turn off blood AND swearing, so that makes it more appropriate for younger kids, however, there is a little bit of drinking and drugs. There is also a very controversial scene where a massacre happens in an Airport and you can hear the civilians shouting in pain as they try to escape. But you are not forced to fire at the civilians and have 3 options: to kill them, walk through the airport as the NPC Terrorists shoot at the civilians, or skip the level altogether with no penalties or missed achievements or trophies, and before you start the game there is even a warning saying there is a mission that you may find disturbing. Overall, great game I strongly recommend it for people that are over 11 or 12 ish depending on what they can handle

Great, Iconic Game remastered for Current Gen
This is a great albeit short game. You play as various characters from military to SAS. This game like most entries in the series, includes a lot of gunplay. The game isnt excessively violent, but includes various violent scenes in missions such as loose ends and no russian. However no Russian can be skipped completely. All in all this game is great for teens who are interested in the original modern warfare trilogy.

not as gory as other games
you can turn off blood and gore and skip some missions that are violent such as ¨no russian¨ . also if you get collectables in the game u can turn enemies into pineapples so it can be violent but can also be less violent.

Great game but pretty mature
It is a great game but has one main mature moment which is in a mission called no Russian and you take part in a terrorist group and shoot up and airport but this game provides the option to skip this mission. There is also swearing but that shouldn’t be and issue for kids aged at least 10 and over.

PARENTS: YES IT IS GOOD FOR ANY AGES.
 
Persona 5: The Royal is an even better expansion of an already great game about justice, desire, and corruption. The main cast all has their own trauma that they overcome with assistance from their teammates, and the characters really grow on you from their initial appearance. The game also features a storyline comprised mostly of outing corrupt adults for their wrongdoings, and making them confess to their crimes. However, the first dungeon, called a Palace, is about an abusive teacher who treats all of the students like human garbage, and “plays scrabble” with one fo your party members, Ann, in return for not doing so to her best friend Shiho. And after the teacher confesses and turns himself in to the police, the writers throw Ann’s character development out the window and 50% of the time they use her for fan service. Another party member, Akechi, is seriously traumatized from being used as a teenage hit man by his father, and after dropping his friendly facade, is pretty rude to the player and the rest of the party. Other than that, this game is a definite must for anyone over the age of 16.

Incredible Game, But Not For Children
This game is incredible, it’s better than the original game in almost every way. The gameplay, the story, the characters, are all improved significantly. I recommend this to every teenager who is either over the age of 14 or is more mature. This game has a lot of sex, a lot of swearing, and a lot of serious topics.
There is a scene about 2-4 hours in where a high school student jumps off of the roof with the intention to kill herself. This same student was driven to do this by a teacher who raped her. Many students are abused by said teacher, and the game makes you hate him with a passion. Suicide and rape are serious topics that I believe people over the age of 14 can grasp fully. This isn’t just saying “they’re old enough to play it if they can handle suicide and rape,” it’s saying that they need to be old enough to understand the severity of the situation to get the most out of this game.
The words s**t, damn, bastard, bitch, a***ole, and piss are used quite often. “F***” is only directly said at most 4 times in the game. One of the main characters, Ryuji, uses the words above but substitutes “f---” for “eff.”
While there isn’t any nudity involving any of the human characters (no more than a woman in a bikini, or a grown man in panties) there are several personas that are inappropriate. The persona ‘Angel’ is a woman with nothing covering her body except simple wraps of cloth around her breasts and her crotch. The persona ‘Mara’ is literally a green penis in a chariot, and none of it is censored. The head of the penis and the balls are all shown off without any covering at all. Ann Takamaki’s persona ‘Carmen’ has a very revealing top, showing breasts on display, but no nipples are on the persona.
There are several personas with cigarettes and/or cigars in their mouth, but it’s not too noticeable. The owner of Café Leblanc, Sojiro, can be seen smoking behind the counter in the evening on some days. One of the confidants in the game is an alcoholic, and you meet with her at a bar in Shinjuku.
The game has great messages telling you to stay true to yourself, and to do what is best for you. The counselor Takuto Maruki even preaches things like “If things get too stressful, never hesitate to take a break, regardless of what it is,” and “Students can’t be motivated by stress to live a healthy life.” The main theme of the game is standing up to corrupt authority, and rebellion. This is a generally good message, and teenagers and adults alike can learn to take charge of their life instead of conforming to everyone else’s expectations.
Overall, this game is definitely worth the 120+ hours it takes to complete it. But I can not recommend it to anyone under the age of 14 just because of the serious topics, the vulgar language, and the uncensored nudity. It’s perfect for people 15 and up and will provide an incredible experience all while teaching them to take control of their lives.

This should’ve been rated T
Persona 5 Royal is an amazing experience. You play as the protagonist, who tries to stop a woman from being sexually harassed and gets falsely accused, (as the story goes on, the ties all together with the main plot) Being sent to Japan to be on probation.

There is very little blood, the only times you’ll be seeing that is in the characters “awakenings” (Though those cutscenes can be skipped with the press of a button) and a character gets shot in the head (no gore, it turns out to be a fake murdering with very little blood)

Swearing may be an issue, it’s pretty frequent (especially the blond haired character, Ryuji) but if your child isn’t offended by it, swear words are mainly said for plot or when characters are stressed (not a lot in one scene though)

There is guns, knives, and other weapons, but most of the weapons are cartoonish, and even when attacking an enemy, it just leaves enemies with stars around their heads or they just fly away (same with the playable characters, no gore when they die, just stars above their heads in a cartoony way)

Good game but some dark themes
So persona 5 royal is a great game with good messages spoiler warning!
however the first "palace" is about sports coach who does unholy things that are very horrible and i think this is the main area that gives the game a M rating because the rest of the game is better their are bad words mainly by one character ryuji sakamoto this one character swears a lot but never the f word which is spoken 1 time and in dialog 3 times. The game is about facing yourself and learning the truth and changing the hearts of rotten adults who violate the deadly sins unfortunately the palace remember is the sin of lust so you can see more clearly what is bad there. The story in this game is mind blowing even a better story than undertale! The story makes the people feel real and they did a great job in royal with the brand new palace making him have no ill will in any of his dialog makes you wonder what to do accept the new reality or not sorry im trying to not add that many spoilers. The puzzles in the game are pretty good getting harder ass you move on and extra fun. That will end this review the game is good with a few dark themes like death and losing family however it makes it seem more real because if they had perfect life it would seem fake.

Amazing game with great messages.
When I got this game my parents were skeptical because of it's M rating, however because they knew how much I wanted this game, they allowed me to play it. I was nervous as this was my first M rated game, however Persona 5 Royal did not disappoint.

This game is one of the most amazing pieces of literature I've seen. Yes, you heard me, LITERATURE. While the game has amazing gameplay with very creative places to do things, this game's story is what caught my attention. I found myself invested in this world of the phantom thievs, and how they are just kids with a strong desire to change the world, and overcome their own problems. The main character you play as has is own false accusation of assaulting someone and has to deal with being the "Deliquent transfer student" while your friends overcome their own problems of their lives, which are near the same level of severity as yours. The only warning I have for parents is that this game is highly addictive, however, I do not see that as a problem, because I think of it as being indulged in a good book. This game will teach your kids that being different is okay, and that when push comes to shove, your friends will always have your back. As I stated early, 10/10 game with a 10/10 story.

Great Game!
Persona 5 Royal is perhaps one of the best video games I have ever played. While the characters are not perfect, I believe this teaches better morals than if they were knights in shining armour, due to being able to see yourself in them. Excellent buy!

Let me start off by saying Yes, this game is very mature and deals with mature subject matter. Having a teacher sexually assaulting his students is one example of mature subject matter. This game does, however, deals with these issues in a surprisingly grown up way. The whole premise of the game is that the protagonist forcefully changes people's hearts to make them better. In my personal opinion, if your are 16 and up, this game night just become the best you've ever played.

Great game, but please know what you are getting into before buying it.
Persona 5 royal is a pretty good game that has an amazing story, great characters and really good music.

However, the game is rated M for a reason. Unless you know for sure you (or your child) are mature enough to play this game, don't buy it.

I guess you can look through the first hour or so of the game, but trust me when I say that this game is best played through blind, unless you already played through the original Persona 5 game, which in that case, go play it, its as good if not better than the original.

tl;dr: The game is rated mature for a reason, so be sure you know what you are getting into.

A good game with powerful messages.
Persona 5 Royal is a better, and improved version of Persona 5. It adds a new semester and new features during gameplay. The gameplay of this game is pretty easy to understand and it tells you the controls if you forget. Gameplay aside, the game has some messages about society that is really important. Especially at the end of the 2nd semester. However, the only concern you should have is that there is lots of swearing, specifically 2 characters who use it the most. There is some reference to drugs, and sexual assault, but those aren't really talked about a lot. All in all, its a great game for teens and downside is just swearing.
