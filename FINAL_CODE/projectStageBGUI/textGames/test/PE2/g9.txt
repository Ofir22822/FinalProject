I don't like metacritic because you don't need to own the game to do a review there. Youtube should be more reliable than metacritic but definitely not even close to Steam reviews kind of thing, it's also going to take some work to go through many reviews. Sorry but I don't really know of anything else.

Though somewhat stylistically uneven, Demon’s Souls PS5 manages to capture the spirit of the original game. The experience is certainly not for everyone, but if you manage to get your head around its steep learning curve and obtuse mechanics, Demon’s Souls will give you a rewarding experience, seeped in an unrelenting and oppressive atmosphere that you will almost certainly never forget.

Fans of the Souls genre will fall in love with Demon's Souls, and anyone who picks it up and manages to push through the fog of challenge will find a stunning world of danger and excitement to get lost in.

If you’re a seasoned Souls-like fan, then it’s worth picking up a PS5 just for Demon’s Souls. If not, I still recommend having your passport stamped in Boletaria, but know what you’re getting into beforehand and proceed with caution … and plenty of Moon Grass.

Demon's Souls is an unrelenting blast from the past, reforged with numerous quality of life changes and looking better than ever thanks to the PS5 hardware that gives this old-gen classic a true next-gen update.

Demon's Souls on PS5 is a brand new vision of a classic, one that captured the hearts, minds, and frustrations of many a player more than ten years ago. Bluepoint retains its pedigree of respecting the original while making the new update seem wholly fresh. If you missed Demon's Souls the first time around, or maybe if you just want to relive some old traumas, the PS5 remake is an excellent archstone to pass through for newcomers and Boletarian veterans alike. Who knew that one of the best PS5 launch titles would come from recapturing the lightning in a bottle that struck back in 2009? You may have died again, but Demon's Souls lives on thanks to Bluepoint and the PS5.

Beautifully remade from the ground up, Bluepoint's visual reinterpretation of FromSoftware's 11-year-old classic is a powerful launch title that brings excitement into the generation to come.

Demon's Souls is the second-best launch title of all time, and easily the best Sony launch title ever.

Although the gameplay of the original Demon's Souls doesn't out of date in 2020, Bluepoint still did a perfect remake job. It not only because the remake version looks like a next-gen blockbuster, but also it plays more smoothly than before. If you love souls-like games, you really should buy PS5 as soon as possible to enjoy it.

Demon's Souls is an instant classic, one of those rare retellings that stands triumphantly alongside the original as an essential experience.

There is much to like and enjoy with Demon's Souls. As a remake, Bluepoint have brought a beloved classic to the future in a rather spectacular fashion. Despite a few technical niggles here and there, and disappointing integration with the DualSense controller, the game offers an otherwise exceptional experience. From the way levels must be tackled strategically, through to how gear must be chosen beforehand, knowing that everything has weight including curatives, is an added stress that players might not realise they wanted from their Soulslike games. Serving to make an already challenging experience even more rewarding, further inciting how this original title truly is the grandfather of all Soulslikes, and for good reason. The Demon's Souls remake is a masterful experience truly showcasing how its genre-bending tropes led to the creation of the Soulslike experience it is known as today.

Yes. This is why you need a review system integrated into the shop. But nothing against multiple sources like Metacritic as a supportive rating.

You can also take a look at opencritic.com. I know it's not exactly what you're asking for OP (because it's not based on user reviews per se), but it does have the aggregation you mentioned so I just wanted to throw it out there.

User reviews suck. For one worthwhile review there are 1000 other crap that are just spams and trolling and other shitty block of text. If your goal is to accurately assess the game's quality, then I'd suggest you go read critic reviews, and the user comments on those reviews.
