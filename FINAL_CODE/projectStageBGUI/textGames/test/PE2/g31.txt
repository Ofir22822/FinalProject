 
Beautiful Game!
Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a masterpiece. Beautiful visuals, outstanding story, the combat is quite challenging, even in the late-game, but you can customise it to suit your style.
There are certain outfits that may be considered inappropriate, but these are entirely optional, and can easily be avoided.

Amazing
This game is awesome, it is addicting and a lot of fun I love the character design too, I have so much fun, don’t miss out!

great game kinda toxic
the game is really good no blood (I think if so very little) the game runs on crappy PC's and is just a fun time (best with friends or making new ones) with really nice maps, but you will need some thick skin to get through SOME games, not all games but some I have been bombed by all sorts of F-bombs and other swears that's why I said best for 14+ all and all good game 50/50 community

It's basically CSGO but needs more strategy
I personally think this game is pretty good overall but it does tend to get repetitive and even stressful. In fact this stressed me out so bad I started performing like garbage and am sitting on a hiatus from a few days now. now that I've spoke about the nature of the game I'd like to get into what it's all about; It's a 5v5 tactical shooter which heavily revolves around team work and strategy which is a mild turn off. The fact that team work is such an important part of this game is a real bummer when u play with random people because like most of the other multiplayer game the community is super toxic and start swearing at you for the smallest of mistakes. So yeah those are my thoughts about this game, it DEFINITELY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE it can get super stressful and super toxic but it does a few moments where you're just having fun instead of worrying about anything else. If you are a parent reading this please don't let 10 year old or 9 year old play this game it has a very toxic community and a lot of bullies.

Just like CSGO but kid friendly
CS:GO is a terrorist, counter terrorist game in which you must either plant the bomb or kill the counter terrorists or stop the terrorists from planting the bomb/defuse the bomb, that is what this game is but they've made it more kid friendly with less realistic graphics and instead of a bomb it's called a 'spike'. the only violence in this game is a little bit of blood splatter when you shoot enemies which is no were near realistic.

Fun game!
I think this game is perfectly fine. Mild blood which can be turned off, some character swearing which you can also turn off, and a sometimes toxic community but you can just turn off voice chat although this may ruin your game experience slightly as you can't hear calls from teammates. If you have let your kids play Fortnite, then you should let them play this, just go through settings with them and turn off anything you don't want them to access. This game is much better than Fortnite overall. Nicer community (still a little toxic) teamwork, and thinking is required. My only complaint is that skins for your weapons are RIDICULOUSLY overpriced like 30 bucks for a skin on one gun? Come on Riot. Overall great game just makes sure you turn off anything you don't want your kids to have access too

Great Game Parents I recommend this if your children play fortnite
To be completely honest I don’t understand what the fuss is about this game. If you let your child play fortnite they can easily handle valorant, though you are fighting you can turn all the blood and death off easily. I recommend this game over fortnite because it encourages teamwork and you really can’t play it without teamwork. So to parents out there this game is suitable for all kids above the age that you would recommend to play other animated shooters. It also encourages short playing sessions (eg: 40 mins) it does this because it requires lots of concentration so your child won’t be able to play match after match without beginning to struggle and then take a break after they realize today they won’t be able to keep playing indefinitely.

It isnt really that bad.
Valorant is kind of like overwatch, a FPS that many parents allow their kids. If you allow overwatch, then you can allow Valorant.

This game is the perfect choice for improving your hand-eye coordination, teamwork and communication. Even though it's violent, I still had fun playing this game.

Great game!
It's kind of a mix of CS;GO and Overwatch. Different colorful team characters with fast paced gunfighting. It has something for everyone and such a great game. But the community can be kind of toxic and some characters swear a little bit but a good game. Blood can be toggled by the way!

fun game
valorant is based on planting and defusing the “spike” in order to win. the goal isn’t to kill everyone. there is an online chat feature, but you can turn that off and mute yourself.

It’s Okay for 10 Year Olds
I have watched many violent movies when I was 8 and played violent video games at 10. I am not violent. Know why? I know in real life, violence is not okay and I know the consequences that come with it.

I honestly prefer playing Fortnite over this, but it is still fun

Great Game, Fine for 11 and Over
While the core of this game is to use guns to kill the other players it isn't particularly gory with just some red blood that is clearly animated and has an option to turn it off (in some cases such as mine I don't actually have an option to turn this off which may be because of my account age not sure though) and all the graphics are very clearly animated so the violence, while using these futuristic guns, is very toned down by the cartoony graphics. This game did cause concern about the anti-cheat and about how intrusive it is because it is installed into the kernel level of your computer however this isn't actually stealing any private information and would make it harder for someone to steal your data than it would for an anti-cheat that is installed on the user level as it is in most games. This game does also have very expensive skins so if you have a younger child playing it make sure that you don't save an credit card details.

Technical skill
This is a very fun and engaging but requires you to be helpful to the team. Most young kids don’t have the time to play a 30-45 min game and still give callouts.

It has blood in it but it can easily be turned off
I got it when it was in closed beta and I really wanted to get it but i knew it had blood in it so I was skeptical the first thing i did was look for the turn off blood setting and i found it. once you play it is very fun.

Good, if you adjust settings.
This game is pretty clean, if you turn off certain things. As mentioned in the CSM review, there is blood, and there is some language. I haven't really experienced either in game because I turned off the blood (there is a toggle, which is a really nice feature), and I turned down the dialogue volume or whatever is is called (E.G. different characters will say things throughout the rounds, and I think the bad language is therein; by turning the volume down for that I don't hear anything bad.)

There is a voice and text chat. Voice chat can be turned down and not used, and I think there is an option for the text chat, although the text chat is filtered.

Some of the female characters wear form fitting and / or slightly revealing outfits, but nothing too extreme.

Overall, if certain settings are turned off / down, this game doesn't seem that bad in my opinion. It actually feels less intense than Fortnite. That said, you really have to judge for yourself and / or your family whether this game is appropriate for your children. I hope this review assists you in making a wise decision for your family.

P.S. the reason I put that I think the game is for kids 13 and up is because I didn't have a choice to leave the field blank; I don't think a blanket age is a good idea; rather, parents should consider their child's maturity and whatnot.

The game is pretty good
It has in game economy so kids can learn how to manage money. It does have blood but that can be easily turned off. Some characters curse like Jett who says "There you are you little s-it" but that can also be turned off. Corpses are shown but it also can be turned off. The game in general is a fun fps shooter game. There are two sides, the attacking and defending. In the buy phrase they buy in-game guns using in game economy, which doesn't cost any real life money. The attackers have a bomb named the spike that they have to plant. The defenders have t defuse the spike. There are in-game gun skins that does cost real life money, but it's not must. Teammates can be rude and toxic but you can mute their mic or text chat.

Not that bad!
I think it is a lot like overwatch, if you know what that is. It’s a hero shooter we’re you pick your character and go into a game of 5v5, again much like overwatch. Lastly, the game is made by a trusted company called Riot Games, they have made many great games such as team fight tactics, league of legends, and legends of runeterra.

I’m a pc enthusiast, and when this game came out I was instantly hooked. The matches are quite long(40mins) for the standard, but the shorter matches are 10 mins (spike rush). This game is an animation, and if you let your kid watch Star Wars, they should be fine. Just tell your kid to turn their mics of since it is very annoying to hear kids screaming profanities into the chat.

Valorant is a fun, animated shooter!
Valorant is a fun shooter made for (in my opinion) ages 10 and up. The game involves animated charactors and no blood.
