Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a charming LittleBigPlanet spin-off that trades its creation tools in for a more straightforward Mario structure.

A delightfully charming platformer, Sackboy:A Big Adventure untethers the knitted knight from the creation-focused LittleBigPlanet and gives him his own grand adventure. In doing so, Sumo Digital has delivered one of the most thoughtful, interesting, and love-laden platformers in recent memory, resulting in a perpetual delight.

In terms of PS5 launch titles, Sackboy: A Big Adventure didn't make headlines as a highly anticipated game, but it manages to be one of the most charming and fun PS5 games so far. Its heart was an unexpected delight, with a level of detail and polish that made it an absolute joy to play. Snipped free of the level creation side of LBP, Sackboy manages to swingamajig his way to platforming heights that the character never has before, in more detail than ever on PS5.

A fun and well designed platformer that lacks the charm to make a long standing impact. You should try it if you want a good and family friendly game for PlayStation.

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is an excellently designed 3D platformer that is full of fun, imagination, and charm. It’s the perfect game to pick up with your PlayStation 5 to give the whole family a reason to crowd around the next generation console. While the lack of online multiplayer at launch is disappointing this game still has plenty of content to play through while we wait for that patch. The imaginative level design, beautiful visuals, and surprisingly good soundtrack will have you and the family smiling from ear to ear until the end.

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a platformer game with some little traditional mechanics that will catch all your attention. You can play with children, with friends or familly in some several levels, but if you prefer you can play alone. The plot is simple and enjoyable and the music will accompany Sackboy during the scenaries. You can't miss this videogame!

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a great adventure game. With some really charismatic supporting characters, and very varied levels, it is a totally recommended game if we are fans of this type of proposal, rounded off by some excellent graphic and sound sections.

Sackboy's presence leading the charge will no doubt attract those who are fond of their favourite PlayStation plush mascot from their childhood. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is an essential for PlayStation 5 owners, and one for PlayStation 4 fans to ring out the generation.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5 is the definitive version of Ubisoft's epic Viking title. With a sharper resolution, silky-smooth frame rate and a reduced number of bugs and glitches, Sony's new console offers a more seamless and enjoyable platform to experience this mammoth, engrossing open-world game on.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla really comes together on PS5. Near instant load times combined with silky smooth performance make it a joyous open world excursion, complete with an engrossing main story. What's more, the countless bugs that plagued the PS4 version of the game have, for the most part, been squashed. This is Ubisoft's best ever attempt at an open world RPG in the vein of something like The Witcher 3, and while it is still a little rough around the edges, Valhalla leaves its mark as a top tier entry in the Assassin's Creed series.

Despite the regrets, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a solid experience within the standards of the franchise. Without proposing to innovate, as happened in Origins, it managed to merge the implementations made by the modern iterations of the franchise with several of the iconic characteristics of the most classic ones, only revised within a new context, making a safe game in relation to the delivered content. In the end, Eivor's adventure is a very consistent entry into the world of Assassin's Creed.

I enjoyed my time with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The combat might be clunky, the stealth might be an afterthought and the game might be rougher than a scouring pad, but the game’s story, characters, themes, and world more than made up for these shortcomings. Eivor will go down as one of the better protagonists in the series, and her saga is one that is certainly worth experiencing…ideally after the game has had a patch or two.

With its much-improved stealth, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has won me over. This feels like the best AC in a long time. It gives you the choice on how you want to tackle your objectives, something Odyssey lacked if you wanted to stay in the shadows like the Assassins of old.

It might not be a quantum leap over the first game but this is still a gorgeous game with a lively world, with a fun battle system and exhilarating traversal, and on the PlayStation 5 with its higher frame rate and blazing fast travel this is also a leaner version of an entertaining game.

Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is very much a continuation of what Insomniac Games built with the last game but when that game was a game of the year contender is saying that such a bad thing? It’s one of the best launch titles I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing and it shows off the graphical, performance, and fast loading capabilities of the PlayStation 5. The story and world activities are also a bit more focused this time around due to the shorter run time which is a good thing in my opinion. Anyone picking up a PlayStation 5 should be suiting up as Miles as it is nothing short of a heart warming fun time.

Miles Morales doesn’t reinvent the superhero genre or change any of the core gameplay that Spider-Man fans fell in love with during the original game. Instead, the charm is found with Miles Morales himself and his journey to establish a presence in New York while becoming confident in his abilities without Peter Parker by his side… Miles Morales makes you feel like a fledgling superhero and a teenager, learning the ropes of life, love, and web-slinging.

Spiderman: Miles Morales is a game with enough personality and entity of its own to be considered a worthy continuation of the 2018 exclusive and, more importantly, one of the great excuses to buy a PS5.

Spider-Man: Miles Morales as a sequel is a half-step from Marvel’s Spider-Man. The game is not trying to bring a fresh take on superhero open-worlds. Rather, it is refining the mechanics and shaping it around the true star of the game: Miles. Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a completely character-driven game that knocks it out of the park and some. Miles, his family, and friends, his neighborhood – all are standout parts of this personal coming-of-age story that triumphs the original game. Take into account the rich Hispanic and Harlem culture is seen throughout, and you have something truly unique.
