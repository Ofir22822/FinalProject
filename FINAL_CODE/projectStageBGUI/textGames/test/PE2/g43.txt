AMAZING GAME
This is my favorite game! I've been playing for a week and am addicted. The only reason I say 6+ is that to really get the full experience you need to read. There's really nothing parents can say to make this look like a bad game :)

The best game ever made.
I love this game so much! I have so much nostalgia from New leaf. I DEFINITELY would recommend this for any age. In this installment of the series, you take a trip to a deserted island with 2 other villagers and Tom Nook. I was unlucky to get Plucky as my starter villager but later on, Beau would replace her. This is such a great game! It inspires you to have the best island and keep things neat! I don't like the fact that there are a lot of loans Tom Nook gives you. There are NO in app purchases meaning you cannot buy Bells or Nook miles. Once you get a pretty village and you get a nice aesthetic, you can play with friends who also have the game, or you can play locally with people near you! This game was released just at the right time on March 20th (day before quarantine for me). I got it for my birthday and have been playing it non stop. In the next part I will discuss some issues

1. No chat filter, but you can report others.
You can basically say anything including lude comments and racial slurs, I think nintendo should have added a chat filter (like roblox) for kids &lt;13. I (personally) don't mind having friends say things like "what the f---" but if you're annoyed by that, I'd make some custom signs as rules for your island.

2. takes too long to get villagers to leave your island
If you're like me, and you don't have any amiibo cards, It can be annoying to switch out the ill-favored villagers for cuter ones. I'm nostalgic and won't let anyone move in unless they are the right villager from my childhood.

3. BUNNY DAY
easter this year was so bad! I only caught eggs when i wanted to fish, my fruit trees turned into eggs, and that STUPID rabbit, zipper, I swear he laughed at my misfortunes.

thanks for reading and I hope you consider this before your purchase.

Amazing!
I have been playing animal crossing for 6 years, and this is my favorite animal crossing game so far. It's a very relaxing game, and has calming music. I like that you can build a community of villagers in your little island. I would recommend this to anyone 6 and up. This game is totally worth your money!

Amazing!!!
Animal Crossing New Horizons is a cute game that is fun to play, and very relaxing. While it is a very pricey game (59.99 USD) it is worth it. The characters are very cute and friendly, and it encourages social interaction and making friends. It may help children overcome shyness. It's also a good game to play before bed, considering the calming visuals. 10/10.

Great for all ages!
During times when you can’t get out of the house, this is a great way to talk with friends. You can also feel like you’re outside, because you live on an island. The animals are always friendly (unless you hit them with a net).

An Overall Wonderful Game
ACNH is a great game - one of the best in the Animal Crossing franchise. My only concerns is that children playing this game should be able to read - this game is very conversation-heavy.

Amazing Amazing Amazing
This game has so many features that you always have different things to do, but not so much that it’s overwhelming. The best way to describe this game is “perfect”.

Super Awesome Game, Dangerous Bugs should be Noted
It is a very awesome game, with lots to do. It’s pretty peaceful and calm, and very fun. It’s also very cute. I recommend it for people who like slow-paced, cute games. It has lots of characters to talk to.
However, before playing the game, you should know that there are spiders, wasps, and scorpions in the game. If you get stung by a spider, a scorpion, or if you get stung by wasps twice without taking medicine, you will black out and respawn outside your house. It is scary sometimes, and everyone should keep this in mind before playing.
The villagers are occasionally a little catty, but they’re sweet and friendly most of the time.
It is educational, if you ask Blathers at the museum to tell you about a fossil, fish, or bug. The game values working to make things happen.
Also, the multiplayer feature should be taken into consideration, and people should never go to the island of someone they don’t know very well.
All in all, a great game, but definitely not okay for children under the age of five. The ability to read and write is a necessity for this game. You should not play this game if you are arachnophobic.

I Want This Game So Bad!
As you have seen from the title of this review, I REALLY want this game. If you've heard of the YouTube channel PeanutButterGamer, he has a pretty great video about it and has done some streams too. But back to the review, I've seen all the trailers, directs, everything... but I don't have it. At first, my sister wanted it more than me As I didn't think too much of it. But as I learned more and more about the game, I slowly came to want it more and now, me and my sister both want it REALLY bad. But my mom has asked me the title of the game multiple times now while on her computer, so we'll just have to see. I just hope she gets it soon, cause if its a birthday present or something, well, our birthdays kind of far away, and everyone is playing it NOW, so... you can get where I'm coming from.

fun for all ages
Almost everyone in my family enjoys it. There are on-screen instructions as you play so it doesn’t take much time to figure out the controls. It’s fun and the best comparison I can make is that it’s like a mix between the sims and minecraft.

New instalment is a trend! And it is good!
Animal Crossing is a relaxing game with a lot of content and things to do. It is almost like a 3D version of Stardew Valley. Play this with friends. Mild violence is present but due to cartoony and child friendly visuals, it's barely mentionable.

A little problem
ok so, I think this is a great game BUT and this is a big but. Nintendo made it so only the player who creates the island and stuff does the main story line, so let your kid do it first or wait until Nintendo fixes this problem

Amazing and Peaceful Life Simulator
New Horizons is definitely one of the best games I've played in a while. Everything about it is brilliant: the controls, the beautiful graphics, the simplicity without being too boring, everything! This game is very kid friendly, I just rated it 6+ because there's some concepts that young kids would have a hard time understanding. For example, this game has a lot of money management. Overall a fantastic game, released at the perfect time.

Same as 1st
Same violence as the 1st (which is rated 15 on this site). Its very fierce and bloody; but also stylized and fantastical, reducing its impact compared to something more gritty and brutal like Bloodborne or Sekiro.
 
not horrible but challenging
its not that bad i love it if your kid is playing call of duty or stuff its really no worse than their campaign and it doesn't swear but play with a friend or its practically unbeatable it requires play station plus to play with a friend

Good game that promotes leadership
When I played for the first time, I found the game to contain quite a large amount of profanity used, though depending on the maturity of your child, it should be fine. I found the gore to be quite extreme, and I disagree with the reviews that say it is very little. For example, if you have a weapon like a club or another blunt force object, you continually hit the zombies on the head until it gives way and explodes brain matter and blood onto the nearest surface. In conclusion, this game is fine for children 13+, and depending on the maturity, possibly even 11+. Thanks for reading!
Edit: It is more of a survival game than it is a horror game, so your child should not be scared of the game unless they are very sensitive to anything somewhat scary. It is extremely mild in the sense of horror and profanity and gore are much more prominent in the game. Thanks!

This game is great, but has blood and gore.
This game is really fun for people who love zombie games. This game takes a lot of skill and is somewhat of a strategy game. In this game you have to build your small community during a zombie apocalypse and keep your people alive. This game does contain gore when you , but since this is a 3rd person game the gore is not super detailed. This game does contain the words f**k and S**t during the game, but i have not heard any other words.

Great Game !!!
This Game is Really Good, although it is a bit Violent. It is not that Bloody and does not have that much Language. ESRB Says it Mature, but they are just being Unreasonable. I am 11, and my Parents let me Play it, and I love it !!! It is also not too hard to Learn to Play ( EX : Minecraft )

A game with potential
As a almost 15 year old, this game is pretty suitable for someone around this age. There is a decent amount of blood and some occasional gore, mainly when there is a ground takedown. The game is quite repetitive, but there are constant content and patches added on weekly. Language is an issue in this game however, as THERE IS NOT a way to turn off profanity. There is the occasional and infrequent profanity from most characters, but one or two like to express themselves with the f bomb quite often, especially when wounded. There is no sexual stuff present however.

It might have some violence but if your kid has played games like halo or overwatch it shouldn't be a problem.
