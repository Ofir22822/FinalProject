Amazing game can turn off gore highly recommended
Love the game back to the good old call of duty games I highly recommend it and make sure to play the campaign it is really fun. There is an option to turn off gore so the game is not violent except for obviously the scary thrilling moments in the campaign there is online play with other people but if your kid is younger I would avoid letting them use the mic it is usually older teens you would talk to. Avoid the zombies though if you are under 14 it is very violent and scary otherwise go for it it is a great game

Black Ops Cold War
It really isn’t that mature. I think that modern warfare is more mature than Cold War. So review: Violence: 7/10 some intense violence, blood, gunfights, explosions, melee combat, but a mature 12 year old could handle it. Language: 7/10 I’ve heard worse in school, your kid probably has also. Nothing for the rest besides alcohol, in which some characters are at a bar, but it’s nothing to worry about. I was actually suprised on how tame CoD is. Way less mature than MW. Maybe only one or two disturbing scenes unlike MW. Really fun.

Okay parents and teens.....
Okay, It's a Call of Duty game. There is violence and swearing but this can be turned off in the settings of the menu. Let's start with the campaign, this is where the M rating for the game comes from. There are words like s--t and f--k used throughout, but nothing more than any action move or PG-13 rated film we haven't seen. Violence is the other major thing in the campaign that gives it its mature rating. There is non-stop violence through the whole story, but the most fun mission in the campaign is one where you don't even kill anyone. You're a spy getting intel in a Russian setting. There can be cocaine seen in the back of a wearhouse in a mission or two, but it is never used.There is absolutely no nudity or anything of that matter. So parents, before you even dismiss the idea of letting your kid play, look into it and read all the reviews and know YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL THE BLOOD AND GORE, SWEARING, IN THE SETTING MENU I THE GAME MENU. Hope this helps someone decide.

Everything you need to know is in this review
DO NOT WORRY, Immediately after opening the game for the first time it prompts you with the question to enable or disable graphic content. If you select to disable, there will not be a single swear word throughout the whole game and you will not see blood and gore. This is a great game, one of the best in the call of duty franchise. The only instance of drugs is cigarretes in the single player mode called "campaign", the campaign is also the only instance of a single poster of a woman wearing revealing clothing. as of 11/17/20 there is no alcohol anywhere in the game. The zombies mode could be frightening for some children. In the multiplayer mode there is a chance you can hear other players speaking, you can easily stop this by muting them or going into a party. Do not worry about foul language or blood if you choose to disable graphic content, if you accidentally allow graphic content, you can change it back to disable in settings

Best game I’ve ever played
I love this game I’ve been playing COD for about 5 years now and I love all of them but this one is amazing. I was expecting it to be worse that MW how I was wrong though. The campaign is 10/10 and I love the multi player zombies is meh but who likes zombies so 10/10. It is not as violent as expected but tackles conspiracy theory's about the Cold War and it has tons of swearing but you can turn off the talking and the blood and gore 10/10 game.

Cute but short platformer has mild cartoon violence.
Parents need to know that this fun game has little to no violence. Common Sense was right on with this review. This game was made to show the potential of the new PlayStation 5 controller. The violence is very mild and there are no frightening scenes. You might use a bow and arrow occasionally but not to kill. This game is perfect for kids and it is a lot of fun, the only problem is that it is a little bit short. This game is also perfect for adults who had one of the older PlayStations. It is a trip down memory lane and a loveletter to PlayStation. Thanks for reading.

Much like previous games, just a few songs with questionable lyrics to look out for
While this game received an E rating versus the E10+ of last year's game, I would say the content is on the same level. There are a handful of songs that contain suggestive lyrics; The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" contains the lyric "You can turn me on with just a touch", Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita has the lyric "Friends don't know the way you taste", and The Girly Team's cover of Till the World Ends has the lyric "Get you off with a touch dancing in the dark". The most questionable songs here are BLACKPINK &amp; Selena Gomez's "Ice Cream" and Billie Eilish's "all the good girls to go to hell". While young children may not pick up that "Ice Cream" isn't about actual ice cream, it will come pretty obvious to anyone older: "You can take a lick but it's too cold to bite me...You're the cherry piece, so stay on top of me, so...Like it, love it, lick it, do it like la-la-la, oh yeah." "all the good girls go to hell", while technically using the word in a religious sense, has a title alone that will be eyebrow-raising to conservative/religious parents.

While written out here this might all sound like a boatload of objectionable content, this all ultimately adds up to a handful of lines in songs that are more censored than they are on the radio, which is why I have kept CSM's 10+ recommendation. It's up to parents to look at gameplay and consider whether they think the songs included are appropriate or not.

Why 10 plus
This is an easy 0 + if I could pick that it is just a bit repetative for 40$

Amazing and extremely challenging game has some blood
First off, I just want to say that Common Sense is exaggerating. There is no mature content other than blood. No cursing, sexual content, or drug use. The blood isn't even that bad either. Successful hits with your weapon sometimes result in a small spray of blood that is usually really hard to see. You will sometimes find blood on the environment, but it's rare. Also, you can stab your enemy occasionally, but this doesn't show blood. This game is awesome and really hard. You will die again and again. I think that it teaches kids perseverance. There were many times where I just wanted to give up, but whenever I pushed on I was rewarded. I recommend this game to any teen who can handle some blood and a challenge.

Awesome
I think that this game is really fun and really reminds me of the dark souls series. I have finished all of the souls games and playing the remake really made me feel like i was playing Ds1 for the first time!
There is minimal blood and really cool back stab animations. There are minimal swears and no sex.
Idk bout you but my class would have been mature enough to play this a few years back when we were 10 or 11 (my class swears often so i get used to it).I think this game is awesome and im a HUGE spider-man fan so I think kids 11 or 12+ should play this. At max 14. Gonna get this for my 13th birthday when i get the ps5.

Good game.
Good game, I wouldn't hand it over to a 8 yr old but would definitely give it to a 10, 11 or 12+ year old as a Christmas present. I absolutely love this game and think it would be an excellent gift.

Sequel has language and violence, but also has positive messages
Parents need to know that Spider Man: Miles Morales is a follow up to the 2018 Playstation exclusive. In this crime fighting game, you play as Miles: a 17 year old boy who is trying to protect his city as the new Spider Man when Peter Parker is on vacation. There is lots of combat, you will beat up criminals whoh will often shoot at you. There are cutscenes showing some violence, but it isn't graphic. There are also uses of s--t and a--hole sprinkled in the diologue. If kids can handle the mature content, they will find a great role model in Miles. He is kind, compassionate, and always trying to help those in need around the city. This game has a strong message of standing up for others and that everyone can be a hero. I reccomend this game to teens looking for a well made game with a great story and smooth combat system. Thank you for reading and I hope this helped.

The best game superhero game ever made.
Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the highly anticipated sequel to Marvel's Spider-Man, a game released in 2018 for the PS4. That game, although I have not reviewed it on this website, is absolutely amazing (10/10). And Spider-Man: Miles Morales is certainly just as good, if not better, than the original. It definitely lives up to the hype - the story is great, Miles as a character is interesting and likeable, the new features (such as Miles' Venom attacks) are super fun and cool, everything about it is just awesome, even the soundtrack! Playing the first game isn't absolutely essential to enjoy Miles Morales, but it certainly enhances the experience. Just in case you were wondering, I'm playing Spider-Man on the PS4, not the PS5. And it's still incredible! Regardless of what platform you play on, it's a solid 10/10 from me.
