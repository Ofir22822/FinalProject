Mediocre at best.
To it's credit Planetfall looks better than you typical average RTS but my God the gameplay and mechanics are 10 times worse. The fights are simply put not fun, moving around the map and finding new territories is not fun. Overall a very polished but extremely boring experience.

It's mild violent but fantasy

For almost any age.
It is a really fun game, simple enough controls and the kill animation is so cartoony, which is good for younger kids. I would put younger but it may be hard for a 4-1 year old to play( unless your really good at games). The violence is no worse than the original game and same with the weapons(they just have different types of them).

Not a game of the year, but a whole lot of fun.
Don't expect award winning gameplay, but do expect a really fun game. The couch coop was fun to play with my son, there was nothing to be concerned about, it's really easy to pick up and learn, and it's only twenty bucks (it's currently game pass too). The gameplay is simple, but fun. Good twenty bucks for a short, sweet, simple game.

Very Great Combat Game!
The reason why I rated Minecraft Dungeons, 14 and/or older, is because in the game you can collect souls from enemies. You get these souls from defeating an enemy; Witch, Zombie, etc, but you can use these "Souls" to attack/ heal/ defeat enemies. But you are trying to save the Minecraft world from the evil Arch-Illager. But it has too much violence in my opinion, because you are almost always attacking a zombie/ skeleton, and there is no blood or gore, but after you defeat the enemy, its body will drop onto the ground like it is dead. And the point of the game is to collect armor, weapons, and artifacts that you can use to defeat enemys.

Minecraft Dungeons is probably for 8 and up
I think that minecraft Dungeons is very fun but the only thing for younger kids is that you need pretty quick reflexes and some boss mobs are hard but I think for kids 8+ it would be very fun. I think violence is 3 out of 5. and another great feature is that you can play multiplayer with up to 4 players

Minecraft: Dungeons, is by far the best Minecraft spinoff
Minecraft dungeons is a great game, altho I'd recommend 11yrs and up for this, dew to the combat mechanics, if you get used to it is vary easy, tho I think 10 year olds could most certainly play this game, maybe 9 year olds, but they would need help.

Over Hyped and has the simplicity of a door
Minecraft Dungeons looks good, it has those great Minecraft art style and the monsters. But frankly this game is terrible. The major problem you ask. The simplicity. It has two attack buttons. You could literally teach a mouse to play this thing. Overall just disappointing because it had such potential to capitalize on the rebooted Minecraft frenzy.

Good game
The Story is a little average, but game play quick and fun.
I believe the game should be for people 6 and up because,
younger ages may get frustrated with it.

Fun game!
I was so exited to play the game when I got it. The only problem is no cross play. Itâ€™s coming out soon

Great Minecraft Game!
This is a great game for minecraft fans. It looks great, and the controls are easy to learn. It is a dungeon crawler so that is different from the original but none the less still great. There is a fair amount of violence however. You have to kill Zombies, witches, armored zombies, Illagers, endermen, skeletons. You use weapons like crossbows, spears, swords etc. Sometimes these mobs will lose their heads. The dead mobs fall to the ground, and disappear a few moments later. No blood or gore though. There is no language. Overall this is a great game!
