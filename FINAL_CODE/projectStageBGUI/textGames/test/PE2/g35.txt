A faithful remake
Having played the original game, this remake does a fantastic job of recreating the scenes while maintaining a fresh perspective of gameplay. I do wish that they kept the scene where the trail of blood was though. There's a bit of swearing though, not that that's a bad thing

For new fans and old
This is a very good game but there are some profanities like s--t and scenes that may fly over the heads of younger players. Other than that most people should be able to play this amazing game

good game
it is a really good game but does have some mild langue.
 
Even pre-teens can play
As an adult who played the original game, and comparing it to this one, I would say to parents that if there child is younger than around twelve or eleven than this may be a bit too much for them because of the violence and profanity. Other than those things this is an awesome game that anyone could enjoy. There's no sexual content, no blood, and there's not too much swearing.

Amazing remake of an amazing game!
This is an amazing game. But, there is a decent amount of violence and swearing. Some characters are drunk and others smoke cigarettes. And some characters also have revealing outfits. But it is an amazing game and I highly recommend it!

Detailed fanfare is a near perfect revisit, for better or worse. Battle system deceivingly classic, but also diverse.
I played the original. The same convoluted plot is still intact, not verbatum, but with all it's basic quirks and complications. The character renditions are near perfect to their nostalgic last century counterparts, but now with over the top, very cliche' cartoon anime emoting straight from any given Japanese cartoon. To the point of all this tho-
What there is to Like:
1. GRAPHICS are very detailed and well done, each part feeling as though it is using the template of the original and filling in the blanks left by many of the limitations of the past.
2. STORY is a slight variation, but this is a good thing NOT just being hopelessly verbatum as it would be boring to predict every outcome for those revisiting the story. In my opinion, this 3 part saga will be much more integrated, detailed and coherent given technology advances plus time and effort put forth into these separate chapters.
What's different:
1. COMBAT is not turn based, per se'. But wait! Although each encounter doesn't cut to a top down fight, you can let the combat play out and use commands as action points build OR control them in real time choosing any character with specific movement, it's your call. Don't let the ongoing animation fool you, you can make it play out very much like the original turn based, only stream lined so you don't have to keep mashing the same button and targeting enemies with arrows every single time. And being without cut scenes, each round eliminates alot of tedium jumping in and out as encounters are seamless. You can slow time to a crawl anytime you want to take your time strategizing like a turn based RPG, pause or get more involved whenever you want at your own pace. I wanted a turn base for sure, but they secretly made it just as good , they just didn't explain it too well in theory how approachable it actually is. It takes some adjustment if you want to learn, but it lets you play how you want. Key is, don't get nervous when things start happening, it's more theatrics than anything else.
2. CHARACTERS were read alongs in the original and left interpretations open as to specifics. Here, each character seems like a great rendition from the originals in terms of dialogue and detail. Where Eastern taste shows is the peace signs, winks, weird grunts and over the top awkward moments that seem so out of place and dramatic to a fault. It has some fantastic cut scenes and details we never had, but this game is hopelessly Japanese at times making it feel like a Kids show or a Pokemon episode. Depending on your taste, it could endear you or just make you shake your head.
The Bad:
1. SAMENESS. Every flaw of the original comes through in some shape or form. If you didn't like the story, character archs or complicated plotlines before, you're not getting a redo here, just more detail. I thought parts of the story were near nonsense before, but it also made it 'not boring'. Nothing here is unfamiliar and your take on the past won't change much here, but it does fill in some blanks.
2. LANDSCAPE is extremely monontanous. Midgard is the entire setting in this first chapter when it was just a few hours of the original FF7. Point being, the dull, grey color pallette dusted with brown almost post apocalyptic setting can get pretty dreary and repetative. Final Fantasy has always been a tech heavy world with magic, but the steam punk, Mad Max aesthetic is ongoing, almost stiflingly so here. Without an outside, flourishing world or remote dungeons to break it up, the landscape can get pretty dull and monotanous for anyone paying attention and hoping for a change of scenery. In this sense, there is no open world feel, only a very linear mission in a very specific place for however long you make your play through last.
CONCLUSION:
All in all, I like the game. But in some ways I like the original better. I love what they've done but I also miss looking forward to a change of scenery and surprises. Not only do we have to wait a long while just to see chapter 2, but so much is known already if you ever played FF7 prior, that this can actually feel like straight up, high budget fanfare instead of an epic adventure with mysteries yet to unfold. I almost feel as if they should have made an FF7- 2 instead of a remake. However, I DO feel as though the developer accomplished what they had set out to do for the most part, and for what's here I'm pretty content for what it is. Honestly, I think I may be understanding the story much better this time 'round, winks, grunts and anime emoting aside.

P.S. For KIDS, a good amount of 'colorful' language throughout. Violence and killing of both monsters AND people. Suggestive themes are very apparent later on, sexual themes become more prevalent but not initially apparent in the early parts of the game.

Definitely for people that played the original as a teen.
Fans of Final Fantasy, especially those that played the original will feel nostalgic playing the game. It is only part one of the game, so be prepared to get the second when it is released. There is a significant amount of moderate foul language, ie, sh**, h***, d***.
The fight scenes are like the rest of final fantasy in that they donâ€™t have blood or gore.
Tifa and Aerith are fairly well covered in the first 2 phases of the game but in the 3rd they very sexually dressed. The entire 3rd phase(Wall Market) is very sexually explicit. Like a raunchy movie set in underground Las Vegas.

A Compelling Tale, Containing Violence and Adult Themes, If it Could Just Remain Focused
Final Fantasy VII, in its original form, is an absolute masterpiece, not only as a game or even just as a work of art, but the tale it tells is absolutely wonderful and deeply, deeply moving. This Remake retells the opening part of the story and expands upon it quite nicely -- Many of the things that the original had room for improvement are fully enhanced in this remake. For example, Biggs, Wedge and Jessie are given full personalities, and Barrett went from being a silly "urban" stereotype to a very full personality, and might actually be the best written character in the entire game. Additionally, Aerith and Tifa both feature more agency, so if you're looking for a story-driven game with strong, inspiring female and non-white characters, these three do an excellent job, even Rude, a villain, as he's competent and intelligent.

The problem with the story is that it lacks focus, and I don't just mean in regards to it being long-winded, although it certainly is that too. No, I also mean that there are times where jokes are thrown into a moment of triumph or tragedy, although luckily these are relatively minor. The biggest problem is that sometimes entire sequences will play out for a very long time right after the main Story's Narrative has emphasized the urgency of another element unrelated. Like, there's a really good part in what's called the "Train Graveyard", but this is literally 90 minutes long, and takes place during a time where your characters need to make serious haste, otherwise thousands of people will die! This completely took me out of the cutscenes during this sequence, which is a shame as the actual cutscenes themselves are very well written and directed, even resulting in some genuine emotion.

As a game, it's very easy to pick up initially, features some excellent graphics and level design, and a wonderful musical score than ranges from cheesy techno to bombastic orchestra and choir. From an artistic standpoint, this might be the best game of the last half-decade as well, featuring both large and small images that are immensely unique (or unique to the original and this remake). Midgar was a brilliant artistic vision in 1997 and this is only more the case 23 years later, and the same can be said from the Sector 7 Slums to the serene and quaint house of Aeirth.

To put it short, Final Fantasy VII remake is a near-perfect 25-30 hour game needlessly stretched to 35-45 hours. The story is moving, the heroes are inspiring, and the game's technical merits are top-tier. I don't, however, recommend this for any children younger than 15, as there are mature themes such as terrorism, loan-sharks, widespread poverty, destructive corporate corruption and even prostitution. These were all present in the original as well, but in the original many of them were subtext to what was taking place, but here there are entire scenes devoted to discussing these themes openly. Additionally, this game showcases the collateral damage of your actions in a way that actually causes serious harm and even death for entire neighborhoods, but I consider this a highlight as it treats this subject, in particular, in a very serious tone. But anyone over 15, adults included, I very, very strongly recommend this game, flaws and all.

Brilliant remake for teens and up!
This game remakes an old classic, greatly changing everything from its graphics to combat. You play as Cloud who is a mercenary making his living in the steampunk city of â€˜Midgarâ€™. As with all final fantasy games, the combat is not graphic or gory, but instead relies more on explosions and fights against big, mechanical bosses making it suitable for a younger audience. There is some swearing, such as â€˜s**t, d**k, p**sâ€™ etc. however nothing too offensive or frequent. Some of the female characters wear more revealing costumes and you have the opportunity to flirt/romance over the course of the game however there is no graphic or even implied sex. Alcohol is consumed but not in excess. Overall, a fun, creative adventure with goofy humour and over-the-top characters good for teens and up

Serious Simple Fun
Just dont expect the depth of Doom. Comically over the top gore with fantasy monster men, but u can turn it into candy and rainbows if you want (seriously).

Really good!
I think that you just have to be able to see gore to do this.

I good
Now it good but the people curse and you made wonâ€™t find the zombies behind you an it doesnâ€™t have no sex.

Remake of the classic shooter is terrifying and profane
Parents need to know that this horror remake is absolutly not for little kids. In fact, every single game in the Resident Evil franchise is not for anyone who is scared easily. This is pure nightmare fuel with a great storyline. Zombies and giant monsters will attack you and take bites out of your neck if they get too close. You will fend them off with lots of different guns, and they dont go down easy. A spray of blood is easily visable on every bullet impact, and sometimes limbs and heads will come off. The environment will be spattered with blood sometimes as well. Somehow, this game really isn't as violent as I expected. While it is bloody at times, combat isnt frequent. There is also quite a bit of profanity. In fact, the main thing that makes this game mature is the many F words and the overall scary atmosphere. I reccomend this game to adults who like horror and suspense, NOT little kids unless you want them to have nightmares for a week.

It is alright for mature kids
My son had asked me for this game, and originally I said no, But after I did a little research I found out that you can turn off blood. There is some language but most teens I think can handle it. Overall i'm so glad that you can turn off the blood, it is a great relief.

Blood, swearing, but most kids can handle it.
I got my son Re3 on Xbox gamepass, and he loves it! It is not that scary, but it has a bit of language. My son was not affected at all, so i think most kids can handle it.

A really good remake of the Resident evil 3 game for the PS1
This is a really good Survival horror remake but this game is really violent including blood and decapitation, and also has a lot of swearing but overall, I would let a 15 year old play it.

Not that bad
The game itself is not bad due to no sex being present. The language is more than shit or the f word in some cases bitch is used. No drugs either making fine as long as your child is mature and not scared easily because sure frightened me.

Gory enough for teens
Teens will enjoy shooting zombies in the head and will enjoy the story. It is much better than the original and has enough gore for teens to handle I think its annoying that these soccer moms think that games like these cause violence, well news flash, that has been debunked many times. So it is perfect for teens

A very underrated game.
I absolutely love this game. I love the challenge, the fear aspect, and just the overall atmosphere of the streets of Raccoon City. So many people hate this game because it isn't as "polished" as its predecessor the Resident Evil 2 Remake. Which is true to some degree. Re2 may be a much better looking, more scary game, but that doesn't mean that Re3 is a bad game. I personally love this game. It is not nearly as violent as Re2, and the zombies are not as scary. So if your child is old enough to play re2, they are really old enough for re3. My only concern is that there are more F-bombs in this game than in re2, which I personally don't even know why they are needed, it adds nothing to the game. This game is still violent though, just not as much as re2. I recommend 16+ or at the youngest 15+ just because I feel it requires more mature audiences rather than tweens or children. It would be very dark and heavy for them. If my little brother watched this game, he would probably pee himself. One great message of the game is that the main character is trying to save civilians from the zombie outbreak, which is responsible and right. So yeah, awesome underrated game, but I recommend your child is a mid-teen before playing it.

This game is good for friends and solo playing
The game itself is amazing with the action and third person shooting. If you want a fun game to play with friends this is the game with over 2,000,000 copies sold in 5 days I highly recommend this.
