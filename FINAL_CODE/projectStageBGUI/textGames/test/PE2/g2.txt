No purpose & Mother’s Voice Super Annoying!
I cannot stand this show. There is absolutely no point to it and the mother’s voice is super annoying.

I feel bad for Ryan that his family are using him to make some cash

I see the parents spend a lot of times with their kids. They are learning and bonding at the same time. Very close family!

Videos great, toys terrible
My 4 year old son loves Ryan and his toys, his videos are great, some educational and don't mind him watching it at all.
But the toys, my god the toys, the small blind bags, yes they are overpriced but my son does love them and I don't mind spending £3.50-4 as a treat from time to time. ... continue reading

Concerning.
My son loved it. His behaviour went from calm and sweet to violent and aggressive, not listening demanding and erratic.

He isn't in school yet and we have a very scheduled lifestyle. I narrowed it down to this show he was obsessed over. Took it away he went right out of control. A day ... continue reading

Just say no.
I'm so glad the YouTube Kids app has a block this channel. Our house is almost 100% Ryan free.

These videos offer nothing. There are plenty of other videos when mom/dad/caregiver needs a break.

Promotes greed and selfishness
Ryan's Toy Review has joined the list of shows that are banned in our home. The show promotes selfish and greedy behavior with the main character, Ryan, being given an absurd amount of toys on a routine basis. Further, the parents provide him complete undivided attention with little to n ... continue reading

Am I the only one disturbed by his googly eyes video where he keeps ignoring his parents demands to stop sticking the eyes on them?
Around a year ago or less, I stumbled upon the googly eyes video where he "pranks" his mom and then his dad for the whole video by magically sticking googly eyes all over their bodies and their house. I can never finish it to fully see if there is anything redeeming at the end, because h ... continue reading

Don't let your kid watch even one video
We made the mistake of having our 3 year old son watch the apparently innocuous video of a kid unboxing and playing with new toys. After some days, our son was spending too much time watching it, but the content he was seeing did not have any constructive material for our son's growth. A ... continue reading

If you care about your child’s developmental needs, do not watch.
Coming from a psychologist, this kind of greed oriented and mindless programming is a waste of your child’s precious early learning years. There is no educational or values associated with this channel and others like it. It will promote low self worth and a mindset that will hinder the  ... continue reading

Just Dont, Run Away While Your YouTube is Safe!
One day while my son is obsessed with Cars, stumbled across this mess called "Ryan's toy review" where this kid had a GIANT "suprise egg" fulled with Cars toys galore. He watched that and that was the beginning of my eye twitch...

At first it was ok, but it has gotten out of control, it is like they have taken over everything. The mother's voice is... I don't think there are words... my head hurts just thinking about it.

And for those saying that Ryan doesn't act like a brat??? You OBVIOUSLY have not seen them all. YOU CAN SEE THE POINT OF EDIT WHEN HE DOES SOMETHING REALLY BAD!!! And his poor poor hamster.

I just sit there with my jaw on the floor like, thats not how you treat a hamster. That fish is gonna be dead in a week. The mother is supposedly a previous science teacher? Yet she is always trying to figure out a basic thing like... "It is called _______ lady!!! For .... sake!!!"

There is no educational value besides the garbage science crap his mom makes rarely, which gets no views because it isn't appropriate for their target age. And for the people who say "well it is a toy review there shouldn't be educational value" it IS NOT JUST A TOY REVIEW ANYMORE! It is just a "quick we have run out of ideas but need to milk the heck out of this cash cow!, throw anything together!!" It is a mess. And just annoying.

Avoid watching at ALL COSTS!!!!

Garbage parents garbage example
I can’t stand this show. Not only is the moms voice terribly annoying but the whole idea is based on exploiting their child for money and products , and role modeling entitlement and spoiled kids.
It’s gross
Don’t waste your time! I do not allow my girls to watch this trash anymore

Ryan’s Toys Review and Ryan’s World
I am really not a fan of anything Ryan, sure he is cute and makes my kids laugh on occasion but these videos only remind kids what they don’t have, very little education offered and really don’t emphasise good moral standards and good behaviours in children. These videos only promote to kids about what they don’t have and not what is really important. When I saw my children ask what Ryan has or can they go where he has gone that was it for me. If you ask me Rydan Schrock is more my kind of video to watch, it’s funny, great emphasis on family time and focus on good family values. Also the toys promoted (which is not much) are well within our budget.
