Annoying parents, terrible content.
Absolutely awful! The only time my girls watch this is of it comes on by mistake on YouTube. The content is not educational at all. The language used is boring and repetitive (E.g. Super duper etc).

Both of the parents voices are totally unbearable! Watch it once and you will see what I mean!

Do not waste any time on this rubbish!

Very opportunistic
Unfortunately, this is more of Ryan's mother's channel than Ryan's as his mother (along with his father) makes up at least 80-85% of video content. Even more unfortunate is the fact that Ryan's mother is highly annoying; her voice is kind of shrieking tone and she talks non-stop! The parents seem very opportunistic, plugging Ryan into each and very venture they can lay their hands on and now seem to be even grooming their young daughters for same kind of role. Besides, what exactly is the purpose of the channel besides showing expensive toys being purchased for kids, and parents spending all their time playing those toys and promoting them -- kind of obnoxious!

See it from a kids point of view
At first i hated this show. Until my four year old was so sad because she couldn't watch it . So we started watching it here and there. Granted yes they advertise in ways a lot but also they teach you things and sometimes its just showing them having fun as a family. More families should come together and play together just for fun. There only little for so long. Our daughter insists on doing things he does like reading or riding a bike and its amazing how much she wants to do things like he does and she does . She learns quick. Sometimes we even get ideas for fun things to do. Not all of them are super expensive.

Unrealistic expectations
I'm glad I found this, my daughter watches this on YouTube and now the annoying fill is on Hulu. I allow her to watch it bc it gives her joy, even though I think the whole family is annoying. The boy needs a hair cut and sounds like he could use a tissue. The Mom's voice is like nails on a chalkboard and goes through my head like needles and the dad we'll he's a part of it all. I think these videos are extremely ridiculous, as many said before this has no educational value except to show off the thousands dollars in toys he gets a week. It's unrealistic bc many children live in a home where Mom and Dad work and can't be a constant source of entertainment for their children. Yes I do play with my daughter and I do spend a good deal of time with her but after whatching videos like this she doesn't like playing alone, it's "boring". My sister bought her a Ryan's toy egg and for $20 I was expecting more than crap toys made in China. Over all I really do not like it don't get your child into or you will regret it. All he does is try to sell his brand so he's parents can continue not to work and live off their children. Dispictable!

Makes Kids Happy, Feel included and Teaches them Science!
My three year old has been watching Ryan and his beautiful family for almost a year now. He already had a big imagination but watching Ryan and his family has only allowed it to grow! As he gets older he will learn from the science experiments too! Even as a parent I have fallen in love watching these videos with my son.

Annoying Parents
I am amazed at all these parents spewing negative comments about Ryan and his family. My now 3yr old watches it and I don’t mind it because there is no violence, my kid doesn’t throw fits over it, she doesn’t ask for any of the toys they play with, and to be honest it grew on me. Whoever said Ryan is bratty is lying because that’s one thing I have never seen. He is also very helpful and loving to his sisters. I don’t love this family but I enjoy watching their outings and them all play with each other. Those kids are not neglected because you can see how the twins are cheerful. Some ya’ll grownups need to chill out. There’s way more worse channels on YouTube that your kids/teenagers are watching behind your backs. No such thing as a perfect parent.

Spend your parents money ASAP
are obviously paid to sell toys. The family is sweet but it is too much . There r inappropriate adult ads with suggestive language in between the shows. Ok to watch once in a while but sales pitches not healthy.

Ryan’s toy review is garbage
Do not let your children watch this. This show is a complete scam. All they do is prostitute their own child for “likes” or followers. They promote garbage toys that are expensive and break within minutes of play. Keep in mind this by is a young child and being forced to produce videos, not allowed to be with friends or siblings, which he has. Any parent like his mom or dad should be stripped by CPS of parental rights. They are only forcing him to say certain things for the product endorsement and not for anything more. Stay away and block this garbage.

Sales and advertising directed at your children
Started good and innocent ..... Then his parents dominated selling cheap quality crap to kids on behalf of the Walmart group.
They have produced apps with games for small children ... And surprisingly they are pay to play and pay to win schemes.

Pretty disgusted with how this has developed

Wow
Wow what a bunch of whiners. This show is perfectly safe and acceptable for kids to watch. And no, it is NOT educational. Pure entertainment. And I’m guessing you don’t sit around watching the History channel, do you? No, the latest Netflix series that you adults watch is also not educational. My 4 year old loves it and I occasionally watch it with him. I find some of the travel episodes interesting, like when they’re in Japan or on a cruise or at Legoland. My son has a blast re-creating Ryan episodes. We play “the floor is lava” a lot, we have a “Yes day” where he makes daddy do silly things that he has to say yes to, etc etc. Ryan is just a kid that acts like a kid. His parents are fun and having fun with him. My only complaint is that every episode lately is about their toys, it’s getting kind of annoying.

Block this channel.
I remember seeing my boys watching his channel when Ryan was playing with toys at a younger age and his parents would play along but now that he's much older and is still doing the same thing and the mom still yapping nonsense in the video. My boys are older and as a parent I would like them to watch content that has some education in it. This channel does not bring anything value able but make your kids want to go buy toys. All this channel provides is showing you new toys in the market. It went from a family channel to a marketing channel and it's not what I want my boys to watch (fake). His channel has been blocked.

Too much hate on here.
The fact that so many parents are on here hating on Ryan and his family, is absolutely obnoxious, childish, and disgusting. First off, i commend Ryan's parents for quitting their jobs to pursue youtubing fulltime. This allows them the opportunity to spend more time with their children, something that a lot of parents around the world don't have the privilege of doing. Any parent knows that spending time with their kids is one of the most detrimental and influential thing any parent can do for the development of their kids. If youre one of these parents saying that Ryan's parents are exploiting him for money, is so stupid. If his parents were driving around in Ferraris and splurging on expensive, materialistic things, then yes they would be exploiting him, but theyre not. I think that a lot of the parents on here are just jealous of their success. I'm sure if you could do what theyre doing, you'd hop on that very quickly and do the exact same thing, but youre not and therefor the only thing you can do is use this platform to spread your hate and jealousy. Show a little humility and be proud of the success this family has found, Ryan shows more maturity than the lot of you. Lastly, a lot of the toys they review are given to them by their sponsors and a majority of the toys they do review, actually gets donated to local charities. This speaks volumes of them and if you think that what Ryan and his family are doing is wrong, then there is something very wrong with you. And if you're one of these parents saying these videos aren't educational, well then they would be educational to you specifically, to teach you what its like to spend time with their kids.

Don't watch will make your kids even dumber!
I don't know where to start. Ryan's content at the beginning of his career(not his career but rather his Moms') was informative, pleasant, and fun; but now with Ryan is getting older and losing more of his core audience, just seems like they are trying to exploit and show off their wealth, and not put much thought to any of their contents. Taking extravagant trips to Japan and buying ridiculous expansive toys to review. While Ryan in the back ground, without nurture or any educational support becomes more like a prop. How many videos have you seen Ryan actually doing stuff. I think, this family with their fame and fortune are being bought by corporations, and what made them famous now is just what they want them to be. I'm not saying all their videos are that way, but I would say 4.4 out 5 videos.
Now with their little twins, that's their next aim. To make them famous and call their new channel Ryan's Baby Twin Toy review. Its really sick. Sorry to be so cynical but I'm just protecting my kids.

Educational and teaches family bonding
Those are saying that this channel is terrible and waste of time, they definitely don't watch it with their kids and spend time elsewhere leaving them alone in front of TV.

The videos are very educational with science experiments, social skills, family bonding and creativity. Its also educational for parents as well on how to be creative with toys and pretend plays with your kids and spend quality time with them.

Yes everything has a flipped side. The mom's voice can be loud and irritating but hey, she is making a lot of effort to give her children the best childhood, which is the most important element in a person's life and it is the hardest thing to do for any parents.

and also, Kudos to the brilliant marketing skills. They are advertising their own products using their own Youtube channel, for which they are being paid for, Unbelievable!!! There is nothing bad by making money out of these videos with children, in fact the kids are also having a great time in the process. If your dull mind couldn't appreciate this idea that's your little problem.

Ryan and his family are doing a fabulous job. Hats off to his parents for all the effort for making the videos through which my daughter learnt many good things.

Unrealistic for kids
My kids think that this is what is expected. While he may never act spoiled or ungrateful, his parents never give him the chance to learn how to behave in a situation when he doesn’t get a new toy or go somewhere unrealistic. My kids get good stuff on their birthdays, holidays, and sometimes just because. Kids shouldn’t get toys just for existing. Maybe if it showed him doing chores and earning money and going to buy a toy then playing with it, that would seem like something I want my kid to watch. And I will be figuring out a way to block all of these channels.

Videos provide zero value for kids or families
Just shows spoiled kid getting pretty much anything he wants. They claim to review toys, but just open boxes and play with toys. What reviews are they talking about? Definitely would not recommend to anyone.

Its OK, my son loves it
I think this is just mindless entertainment, but its not meant to be an educational show. Thankfully my 6 year old is not the type to want all those toys just because Ryan has them though lol. I just tell him toys are expensive and I can't afford to get him a lot. He seems to understand. Its amazing how hateful some of these reviews are. I mean I'm a little jealous of Ryan's parents too, making all that money lol, but they seem to be decent people. And at least they're spending time with their children, instead of sending them to daycare for other people to raise.

Ugh!!!!
What i like is that it is a real family. What i dont like is that my son thinks he can mail himself to ryan. He got a golden egg for christmas and the code had already been used. My son cried. I feel awful as a parent for allowing him to watch it. He is too young to understand that he does not get to meet him because we are so far away. It breaks my heart because he wants to meet him and i can not make that happen.
