Really ehh game
Idk the games ok I’m not a huge fan but the M rating is there for a reason.

age 6+ 
Good game, terrible age rating
How on earth did this game get rated 10 and up. It has no blood, no death is shown upon crashing, and no language, except for maybe online but I have not heard anyone swear yet so it’s fine. Even in CSM’s own review, they state this, but they include consumerism which is what I believe led them to rate it 10 and up, but that’s still dumb because the only consumerism is from cars and child is able to buy a car obviously.

age 17+ 
Violent and blood and gore
It is rated for esrb mature

Misfired Criticism
For the most part, CSM hit the nail on the head with this review, giving it 3/5 stars due to its numerous technical flaws. However, I think it's important to point out that this game was made by one man. Literally, one singular dude designed, programmed, and developed Bright Memory. The game stands alone as a testament to his achievements, and for that I would grant it an extra star. Had it been developed by a studio, it might've been flawless.

I love this game
I love this game more than Odyssey, the story is deeper with more purpose and there is more to the game as well. It’s an adventure of honour, loyalty and starting new. You upgrade your village, help your friends and make alliance's with other viking groups and you go on raids and take down a network of bad guys.

I think this game is suitable for 14+ but if they’re too immature for the sensitive topics then absolutely turn the censors on.

There is a lot of violence, obviously. But I found that I didn’t notice the gore, you’re too busy running away to notice the blood or a too-small flying head.

Sexy Stuff - there is a cut scene in a brothel but there is only one topless women, she is the heavier chested women but nothing over average. You can also see sex sort of camera and in the background, but it isn’t graphic at all. You also see men in their undies. It’s not heavily sexualised and very toned down, which I appreciate.
You can also romance characters but you don’t see anything.

Drugs, there is drug use, sometimes accidental but it isn’t glorifying or anything.

There is swearing but not too much.

Amazing Game, Great Messages
This game has many great messages such as the only honorable way to die is in battle, so if you didn’t die in battle your a coward.

Some tweens/younger teens can handle
My 12 year old asked recently for this game. I wasn’t so comfier blue with an ‘M’ game at first because the hasn’t played very much violent games, but I thought he was mature enough, so I got it for him. Then, my 10 year old asked to play this. I said when I watch him play this for a few weeks. Then, I realized it’s an amazing game! If your kid has played Overwatch, they are definitely ready for this!

The Best game for teens and pre-teens!!
This game may seem not to appropriate on the outside but when you dive into the game it is a jewel that I think all kids should learn about because Vikings are part of the world's ancient culture. There is some blood but if your kids watch Avengers then there is no problem. I think this is a great game and is appropriate for most Teens and pre-teens!!

Great game!
Really good! A little bit of blood but nothing too serious. Fine if you are 12 or a mature 11 year old.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla
Assassin's Creed Valhalla is separate in the Assasin's Creed world. It is the first title in a new series. This particular game has a fair amount of blood but that can be turned off in settings. As far as scariness it is about a medium on a scale.
It has great music and is very realistic to what Vikings did back in the old days. There is singing, fighting to protect your territory from other Viking clans, and most importantly great scenery. Graphics are absolutely amazing and you completely control everything in the game. It's like a choose your own adventure book but in the Viking age. If you or your child has watched things like Avengers: Endgame or any of the Avengers movies Assassin's Creed: Valhalla will be OK. The only big thing is the scariness and that's pretty much it. I hope this will help you!

Seems fine as you can turn of blood, gore, nudity, esc with the right settings its fine for anyone

Great Game
It is historically accurate and I think that it would be great for your kid to play it. Make sure they can handle violence and it has some scariness so make sure they can handle that but overall it is a great game.

Love it so far
This game is amazing here is my review for all the categories
Sex 2/5 There may be some nudity but you just hit like two buttons to turn it off
Violence 5/5 Lots of blood and gore if you don’t like your kid seeing that stuff don’t let them play
Language 4/5 Some f words but not frequent
Drinking, drugs and smoking 3/5 Smoking and drinking are part of the game
Positive messages/role models 1/5 Not really any of those but when you raid a village you can’t kill innocent civilians
Overall great game recommended for kids 12+ That can handle violence

Good game
It is amazing what it can teach you and I recommend it to everyone looking for a good game to play that is not to complicated but still enjoyable.

age 14+ 
The masterpiece returns and so does Virgil
Still teen friendly. Fantasy violence with blood. Next-Gen delivers the performance this game deserves.

Easy Game
The game is too easy oops accidentally did it blindly in a pretty quick time.
The best thing since torn with your hands bread
UNDERRATED it's a masterpiece it REALLY is i cannot express just how much good this GAME is it's so good AND it deserves to be recognized for how good it is and YOU will never play somethinglike this again boi

age 15+ 
Nice game
I think little hope is definitely safe for people 15 and up it uses a bit of vulgar language and there are some bloody scenes.Oh,and it’s also pretty spooky.But other than that there’s nothing really unsettling about it.And I think that it’s good for ages 15 and up.

Great
This game is amazing the jump scares are great I’m 13 and I felt comfortable playing and played with a friend who is also 13 we both got a really scared by the jump scares but it isn’t to bad. But don’t let ur kid play by him or her self it is very scary without a friend but I would recommend this game.
