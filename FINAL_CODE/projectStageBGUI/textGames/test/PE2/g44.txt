 
Good game that promotes leadership
When I played for the first time, I found the game to contain quite a large amount of profanity used, though depending on the maturity of your child, it should be fine. I found the gore to be quite extreme, and I disagree with the reviews that say it is very little. For example, if you have a weapon like a club or another blunt force object, you continually hit the zombies on the head until it gives way and explodes brain matter and blood onto the nearest surface. In conclusion, this game is fine for children 13+, and depending on the maturity, possibly even 11+. Thanks for reading!
Edit: It is more of a survival game than it is a horror game, so your child should not be scared of the game unless they are very sensitive to anything somewhat scary. It is extremely mild in the sense of horror and profanity and gore are much more prominent in the game. Thanks!

This game is great, but has blood and gore.
This game is really fun for people who love zombie games. This game takes a lot of skill and is somewhat of a strategy game. In this game you have to build your small community during a zombie apocalypse and keep your people alive. This game does contain gore when you , but since this is a 3rd person game the gore is not super detailed. This game does contain the words f**k and S**t during the game, but i have not heard any other words.

Great Game !!!
This Game is Really Good, although it is a bit Violent. It is not that Bloody and does not have that much Language. ESRB Says it Mature, but they are just being Unreasonable. I am 11, and my Parents let me Play it, and I love it !!! It is also not too hard to Learn to Play ( EX : Minecraft )

A game with potential
As a almost 15 year old, this game is pretty suitable for someone around this age. There is a decent amount of blood and some occasional gore, mainly when there is a ground takedown. The game is quite repetitive, but there are constant content and patches added on weekly. Language is an issue in this game however, as THERE IS NOT a way to turn off profanity. There is the occasional and infrequent profanity from most characters, but one or two like to express themselves with the f bomb quite often, especially when wounded. There is no sexual stuff present however.

Its a good zombie game
It might have some violence but if your kid has played games like halo or overwatch it shouldn't be a problem.

NOT AS BAD AS THE OTHER CALL OF DUTY GAMES
Not as bad as the review says it is you can turn off the blood and gore as well as the cursing in settings. Otherwise it can be scary if you get sniped out of no where. Just make sure that you trust your child to turn off the gore and cursing and if they are mature enough then I think it is fine go for it!

Battle Royale meets call of duty
It is okay for teens to play. And yes it still has lots of violence and blood just like other call of duty games. And it surprisingly has disturbing images and what I mean by “disturbing images” is since this game is a free roam battle Royale game There are sudden sounds and shootings. It could scare kids. I’m sure teens can handle it. Great game for teens!

Fantastic game
First of all the professional review said the game mostly just had the word sh*t in it. But nearly every time I get into the gulag I’m greeted with profanity which is mostly an fbomb. Other than that this game has Barley any violence as most people you kill are from a distance. But once up close blood is easily noticeable.

Fun game!
The gameplay if probably fine for most kids 13+ at that point kids have been introduced to swearing so that’s probably not a big deal at least to the kids I can’t speak for adults. There is gore present
but honestly I don’t see that as a big deal and if you do you can turn it off. The gameplay is a lot of fun

Another Battle Royale Game
This game is more on the lines of PUBG than Fortnite, and yes it is M-rated. The language is pretty strong with the f-bomb and s-word tossed around frequently and if you go to the Gulag, the UK Team Leader will usually say "Go sort this f-er out." Other than that, the violence is just a red splash of blood, no gore, it pushes the battle pass on you, and there are lots of PC cheaters. But that's just life and you have to live with it. There is open online chat, which is not a new thing in today's world, and the Plunder mode is pretty exhilarating and a nice change from Battle Royale. This is set in the universe of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019, and Warzone pushes you to buy Modern Warfare and any other Activision games that have come out recently. After a while, the game can get boring but its really fun if you're playing with friends. And for those of us who hate hearing toxic little kids, good news: all of them are playing Fortnite, so you'll hear mostly older teenagers on Warzone, which is good.

TL;DR- Good game, 9/10 would play again. Be wary of PC cheaters.

I don't get what the 18+ rating is for if you turn on parental controls all you have is a realistic fortnite with tomato sauce.

Great game. The gore shows bullet holes that aren’t very realistic, but are still bloody. When shot, the character will leave a Tarantino style blood decal on the wall behind them. Some characters do cuss though. When one does an execution on another, he might utter, “Got ya c*nt” but if you use the default guy he doesn’t cuss at all and is silent and pretty much an empty husk of a person.

Get serious!
This game is very good and has barely any violence! You can turn off the gore and dismemberment. Please trust me because I love games. It was made for People to stay at home during the Coronavirus. You HAVE to let your Kids download this game.

Fortnite But For Teens...
So, this game is a Battle Royale game that is arguably better than the thousands of others out there. It has blood, gore, profanity, and partial nudity than CAN be disabled. The nudity is women wearing tight bikinis BUT it is mostly in the form of stickers. Once you disable the profanity etc. it should be fine for 13 year olds. The only thing that I would say could be harmful is that it can be violent. Unlike Fortnite, it is violent and realistic. Since it is realistic some parents would not want to let their kids play games where they are pumping a person full of metal. BUT that does not mean to ban your kid from getting this game. It (to some extent) teaches you strategy and teamwork (if you play with more than one person). So my conclusion is to let your kid buy this game and then you as the parent can go into the game and turn off all of the blood and gore etc. So just because its rated M doesnt mean that your kid isnt mature enough to handle it.

Nice twist to the Call of Duty franchise
If you ever feel like you need a more realistic, fast paced battle royale game I think Call of Duty: Warzone is the thing for you. The marvelous gun, character, and environment graphics are one of the things that make Call of Duty: Warzone what it is today. The game graphics are still amazing when you put them on low mode, but if you put them at medium or higher they become notably realistic and almost seem to pop out of your screen. There are rarely any glitches with character animation, and the way that the characters interact with things are very smooth. The realistic sounds and effects of Call of Duty: Warzone make you feel like you are really there. There are also a lot of different game modes so you don't get bored of battle royale. While it might be true that the online player community of Call of Duty: Warzone is toxic, what matters more is that most of the people will help you or just be kind in general. It is an extremely big player base and there are a lot of people, all levels and ages. However, you definitely should watch out for toxic people, because there are some. If you or your friends need a little adrenaline boost or motivation, go to your nearest console or computer, download Call of Duty: Warzone, and give it a nice, good playthrough.

Its fine
There is nothing in it i have no idea why it says some operators smoke because i havent seen this. Its just a battle royale game. If you dont want blood effects im pretty sure you can turn it off, it does swear a bit but not that much its mostly certain operators that swear and also when you enter the gulag, which is just where you go when you die to see if you can get a second chance, its a grand game.

Friend
Every parent thinks that this game will turn there kid into a monster. It wont. I've been playing this game with my friend for a long time, and its been really fun. One of my favorite streamers reckless killed himself and me and my friends were devastated. We decided to tell the game lobby about it and just like that, we were all in down town being peaceful not shooting each other and sharing our prayers for him. Then, WE ALL HOPPED IN FRONT OF THE TRAIN AND WENT TO HIM!!! I have made memories on this game and its crazy how respectful the community is. It is not a bad game at all.

great strategy game!
This game is a next gen version of fortnite. You land on a large map and try to be the last standing. There is virtually no blood or gore, and there is only a little bit of language. The only thing that draws a star is the difficulty. Activision decided to pair pc players with console players. On some occasions i have not even landed before i am shot out of the sky. If your child has a hard time losing, this game is NOT FOR THEM!!

Warzone
Sure the game is a bit realistic but you have to take into account the unrealistic stuff to like how gas just happens to make a perfect circle for players to fight in and how when u die after absorbing manny bullets u go to the gulags and fight for your freedom.no I’m not denying that it’s a strait up violent game.at first I didn’t want my kids playing. but I decided to give it a chance since it was getting such Good reviews.and I have to say after playing it my self I started to like the game.the only thing I dislike the game is that you can talk to totally random people on you squad.but u can mute them and go about your game.
I give warzone 5 out of 5

Some blood and a few swears
Warzone is like any standard Battle Royale shooter. 150 players, in solos, duos, or teams of 3 or 4 fight. There is a large arsenal of guns with many different play styles. There is visible blood upon bullet impact but not much else related to gibbing. Your player or commander may say phrases like “let’s sort that fuck*r out”. For the first 20 minutes of the match, players who are killed, or rather, captured, can fight their way to freedom in the Gulag. In team modes, if the Gulag is closed or the player lost in the Gulag and remains captured, teammates can buy them back. You may inject yourself with healing items to revive yourself, but shields are armor plates and your health regenerates. Over all, the blood and language are tolerable for anyone who is mature enough. The only realism is in the graphics, not the gameplay or violence.

So fun but...
(I am only 10 so if my spelling is bad please don't judge me)This game is AMAZING it is a FPS battle royale game but COD. I fell in love with this game instantly it's so good, but if your your kid is not 14 and up they probably shouldn't play it. If they are mature I would say 10 and up. The reasons why I think this way is that if you, your teamate, and I think an enemy gets shot and/or shot at they drop F bombs and say more cusses, blood can be shown when getting shot but not much, however there is something you can change in the settings that makes there be more blood, gore, and dismemberment. If you don't want to have your kid here cussing have every volume turned down except for music and I think the other one is called game effects, there is also another thing to do if you don't wasn't your kid to read cusses in the text chat, there is a setting called profanity filter and you want to have that enabled. So if you do all of that I would say 9 and up. If your kid is under 14 and they want modern warfare you should probably say no and if they ask way, say that I said there are many disturbing scenes. Overall amazing game I love it.
