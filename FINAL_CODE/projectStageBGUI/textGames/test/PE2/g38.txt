 
An improved version of an excellent game (good for teens)
Persona 5 royal is the new version of Persona 5. It adds extra content to a very long game already!

Violence:
Some blood spray when characters take off masks and "awaken" their persona but usually just violence you'd see in a typical RPG. Some references to suicide.

Language:
F word is used very rarely so the language is as bad as a PG-13 film.

Sexual:
One infamous persona looks like a green penis on a chariot. 12 year olds would find this funny. References to pedophiles (the 1st main villain is a pedophile but you send him to prison) 12 year olds joke about pedos though.

Overall: 12+

Objectionable content that serves a purpose
As the title states, Persona 5 Royal is without a doubt one of the greatest games I have ever played. From start to finish, the story and characters are phenomenal, and most importantly, the characters feel like real people.

Unfortunately, with this realistic approach, there is bound to be some objectionable content that earns the game it's M rating. First of all, the dungeons in this game are based on the concept of the "Seven Deadly Sins," save for a few of them, and naturally one of these dungeons is based around the deadly sin of lust. While nothing truly horrifying is shown on-screen, we do see characters behaving with sexual implicit mannerisms, dressed in extremely skimpy clothing, and worst of all, the boss of this dungeon, a high school teacher, is heavily implied to have raped a student, which drove her to attempt suicide. However, as the main goal of these dungeons is to get the ruler to confess their crimes, these all serve to make the player despise the ruler, and helps to get the player invested in the story while not promoting these sorts of actions. Further sexual content is present throughout the rest of the game, but not frequently. Some Personas (think Pokemon, but demons) have genital-like protrusions, or are almost completely composed of genitalia, but these are few and far between. Additionally, some characters will make sexual comments toward others, but it is usually played off as a joke, and the character receives some sort of comeuppance for it in the end.

Additionally, with the characters being realistic, there are also some references to both drugs and alcohol in the game. One job the player can undertake in the "student life" portions of the game are working at a cross-dressing bar, and one of the player's "Confidants" (a character who is thoroughly explored) is an overworked journalist who frequents the bar and is more often than not seen drunk. Additionally, the player's main source of healing items comes from another Confidant, a shady doctor who has a license to produce her own medications, but not test them, and so uses the protagonist as a guinea pig of sorts.

There is also a great deal of swearing in the game, as per the norm with M-rated titles. The majority of the swearing comes from a particularly vulgar character, Ryuji Sakamoto, who is present from the very beginning of the game, and frequently uses words such as "s**t" and "b*st*rd.* Most of the swearing in this game is of this caliber, though there are a few instances of "f*ck" being dropped by some mafia members. There is also quite a bit of violence, with characters being shown bleeding frequently and various forms of executions being performed in Persona Fusions, including guillotines and the electric chair. However, the blood effects are more cartoonish than gorey, and the executions usually lead to the Personas dissolving into light rather than being extremely gruesome.

All in all, the objectionable content isn't possible to ignore, but it certainly isn't encouraged by the game. If anything, the games very themes about making criminals confess their crimes are a testament to the fact that the game speaks out against such things. All of the objectionable content serves a purpose in the story, weather it be to make the player despise the antagonists, or to realistically characterize high school students and their own inner struggles. Given the things people know about in middle and high schools nowadays, I see no reason why someone around those age ranges shouldn't be allowed to play this game- there are far worse ones out there.

Every family should play this
This game has everything for the whole family. Sure, there is heavy language and sex references , (and an arc that implied a girl was raped) but the good overweighs the bad. Each phantom thief is a great role model that all kids can look up to. Also, this game overall has a great message. It’s that nothing will change in the world unless you make it change, which is a great message for kids. 10/10, every family should play this

Kono, Giorno Giovanna, niwa yume ga aru
Persona 5 è un buon gioco che insegna alla morale dei bambini. I contenuti di questo gioco includono riferimenti a droghe, alcol e tabacco. Alcuni non giurano nulla che un liceale non abbia mai sentito. E alcune simpatiche anime girls in bikini, ma a parte questo è un buon gioco per raga ... continue reading

Great game
It’s one of the few games that explores the idea of jungian concepts of the self and the shadow self, while also delving into real world politics and current events. Not much of any cussing or violence, it’s more like an anime in the sense of art style. The moral of this story is to be true to yourself, follow your heart and do the right thing. I don’t know if children will be able to truly grasp the hidden messages and read between the lines.. for that reason I will say the older you are, the more you’ll most likely enjoy it. Obviously there’s always the exception to the rule, but this game is deep. Take your time! The more you know about psychology, the more interesting this game becomes. Hence why I think older kids will like it a lot more. Other than being at an age where you truly grasp everything, I suppose a 13 year old could play based on what’s there, I just don’t think a child that young would really grasp this story psychologically. Again most likely the older you are, the more interesting it becomes. Check it out!

Take it from someone who has actually played the game
It isn't overly violent, some blood and sometimes enemies explode into blood but the violence is in a comical style and not gory.
As for sexual content, although never taking itself seriously, you may be horrified by some of the content. I'm not going to hide anything so I would like to point out that it includes anal rape - there is a weapon called the rectifier where the player sticks it up the enemies bottom (it blurs it out its more implied), it's not graphic but it's in the game. There is also the option to sleep with characters although in this case nothing is shown. Your character can be naked in most parts of the game and it will blur the nudity, on pc there are mods to remove the blur, including on the afformentioned rape so make sure your child doesn't use them.
Language is bad but big deal they've heard it all before.
There is a sequence where you snort a fictional drug and get really high and start seeing curries as well.

AWSOME GAME but not for young kids
Great game for teens, but very edgy for young kids. its about you as a S.W.A.T member and your mission in companion mode is to kill terrorists which involves slitting throats, stabbing, and shooting, and one scene involves a guy peeing and you stab him. although you can not see the private part, it is still very clear to the audience what he is doing. although its a great game, it may not be suitable for young children.

Definitely a 50/50: Gat out of hell
There is a lot of sexual innuendo and a lot of killing, but it is one of those games I play just to muck around in. You have a lot of powers and weapons to chose from and the blood can depend on what you do as well. It is always meant to be taken as a silly game (So to speak). So if your kids under stand that is a silly game then I would say give it a chance. Also another thing is it is set up like a fairy tale which can put some people of.
 
Not that bad!
A lot of people say over the top I was skeptical about it at first to but then my son showed me the story I said NO but then he said I'll just free roam beeing the old timer I am I didn't now what that would mean he showed me it and it was fine! I make sure every day or so to make sure he isn't doing the story and he isnt! (My son is 8)

fabulasssssssssss
this game may be a little hard to grasp at first but I think that its ok for children. I think us adults underestimate out kids influences most kids know exactly what's happening and don't really care. sure they might annoy you talking about how amazing it is but really I think you should just let the kid go and let him/her play what they want to they just want the game for fun not for the sex violence and drugs. kids are just like us but smaller. so this game is good for kids.
