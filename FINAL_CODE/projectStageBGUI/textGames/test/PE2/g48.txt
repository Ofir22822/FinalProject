Just amazing!
Amazing graphics. It may be hard for younger, inexperienced players to understand. It makes you feel as if everything in the screen is real. No spoilers from me, but I thing it's just stunning.

Absolutely Stunning
Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a game that you'd have to play in order to fully appreciate it. Visually, it's gorgeous. The artwork is amazing and the animations are very fluid. The gameplay is a huge step up from the previous game, with much more combat-oriented options. The story is a bit all over the place in the beginning, but once it gets really into it, it all makes sense.

it doesnt work
its so dumb it doesnt work.

the best
Here, play bob the robber 4 on hud games, not everyone knows.

Complete waste of time and money
The graphics on this game are so poor even players with the strongest stomach will feel car sick, there is no free play mode or maps on this game so venturing off the track will just reset you back to the track. Very disappointed with this game after all the hype. It's a good thing I have the real deal in the garage to play on.
 
This game isn't violent
The reviews for this game compares it to gta, this game has almost no violence. The blood is almost none, the only concern is the story being a bout the mafia. My kid was begging me to let him play it so I sat down and watched some gameplay and then decided it shouldn't be R at all. It should be M. After my sun played it he said it was really good and he enjoyed it and is waiting for the next game to come out now!

A Great game but not for kids!
The game is set in 80s Japan during the bubble economy - which means that the backdrop is a time of sex, booze and gangsters. Which should be enough to keep kids away from the title.

The story is great, it is about a young guy who is framed for murder and is trying to find his way in the world of the Yakuza, big buisness and trying to figure out what like is about. The game actually has two MCs, the other one is a Yakuza who has fallen from grace and is trying to get back into the game. Both MCs are pretty moral (as in they don't want to kill anyone and try their best to be as good as they can be).

All in all one of my fave games but not one I will ever let my kids play (until they are old enough) especially with the VERY stark sexual themes (which are in a lot of mini games and impact the main story).

Amazing
While this could be one of the best of the Yakuza games, it full of violence and swearing, the fights are mostly tame however the heat action moves could range from enemies having their heads pushed into wall or being crushed by bicycles. There is also one or two torture scenes, one in a flashback, mostly obscured but the second is far more graphic. The story is also mature and at times very emotional. Best left to the adults but still one of the best titles on PS4.
 
Not tame, but not too crazy
I first played this game when I was 16, Majority of the reviews I read at the time claimed violence as extreme as Mortal Kombat X, but that was not true by a longshot. There was no intense blood or gore, still even a little could be a disturbing sight for kids under the age of 12. many of the reviews I read criticized a part in the story (trying to keep this spoiler free) where a man cut off his own finger. However, this action was off camera, and you did not see his injured hand nor the actual finger. The story was great. 10/10 the best game in the series, also the best game to play first. There are some women in bikini outfits but no nudity or real sexual content, another thing that reviewers and the ESRB were going off about. Would recommend to ages 14+

Most violent one of the series
You can tune down blood amount. Although attacks can still be cruelly violent. Strong language is frequent, but heard in Japanese(still seen in dialogue). Smoking and drinking is done by main characters. But story is very great, engaging.

Yes.
As a teenager who played worse games before this (GTA, Saints Row, Etc.) this game is pretty tame compared to them but a hell of alot more fun and a more interesting and intense storyline, it's not some shoot-em-up GTA style game instead, this game is actually good, it has the right about of story telling as well as gameplay which is mostly beating people up, though there's side quests and optional things like Karaoke and dancing. In my opinion, even in the Yakuza setting you're still playing as a good guy, in this particular one you play as two different men who have to battle their hardships to save the ones they love.

Japanese GTA is a tad bit tamer, still not for young children.
There are no explicit sex scenes/nudity in Yakuza 0, so if that's your main concern with games like GTA 5 this is a great alternative. However, there is still strong violence, language (again, not anywhere near as much as GTA), a minigame involving flirting with bikini-clad girls, and the ability to get drunk. Good game for those who are old enough to handle it.
 
Japanese version of zero series is NOT for kids.
Many people don't know but the japanese versions of some zero games are very violent, if you switch your game version to japanese of a zero series not the zx, there is a lot amount of gore. The robots even splatter blood so only adults or teens will play the japanese version if they like blood and the story also has a pretty dark tone too. The english version is very fine though. It is a really good hack'n'slash game like devil may cry but it is 2d, you can eliminate enemies like a super cool assassin robot.
 
The Mega man Formula Refined And Perfected
Megaman Zero/Zx Legacy Collection is a very great game with 6 classic games inside (for parents there is lots of blood in the japanese version so dont let your kids play it. the blood is actually just red oil but its like blood.)i have played mega man for most of my life and zero was always my favorite character. there are some death scenes like in Mega man Zx, a character named giro dies. And zero dies too (sadly) but they dont show it.Zero Is a great role model because at the final boss fight of zero 4, Zero says right before the fight "I never recalled ever calling myself a hero, and I only fight for those who i believe in." (giving zero his answer to the mega man x4 zero saying, "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FORRRR?!?!?!?) And he knows even if he has to lose his life to save others, he knows its for good reason.Many of the characters are good role models but Zero is the best one of them all.

Fun, but hard!
This game might be rated "T", but in reality, the game itself is not bad. In fact, when the games originally came out, they were all rated "E" or "E 10+". There is a tiny bit of blood in the beginning of the first game, and the circuitry of robots are red (so it looks a bit like blood) but there is nothing gory. I myself hate blood, but this game was not disturbing in the least. It's pixilated, so the blood is NOT realistic. Now, as for the fear factor, there are some very slightly disturbing things for more sensitive viewers.
A) The protagonist, Zero, kills all of the Mavericks in cold blood.
B) Dr. Weil is downright CREEPY, and there is a slightly creepy image of him in game 4.

One VERY important thing to know: The games are HARD. Originally, they were practically impossible for less experienced players. But with the addition of save-assist and casual scenario mode, the game can be much easier. I would say that it might be a little too tough for kids ten and under, but again, I don't know the skill level of any one kid.
This game is truly a masterpiece, one of the best in the Mega Man series! It is so fun, and I would definitely give it a try, no matter your age! Play Casual Scenario Mode if you are having trouble beating the game.

Thank's for reading!

why pay money when you can get it for free
why pay money when you can get it for free.

Very child friendly
The original 3ds version was 10+ and this should be too. There’s nothing graphic or sexual. There is some minimal language such as hell, crap, and dumbass but most kids know those words anyway. You can buy wine but it’s only really for cooking. You don’t even kill the monsters; you just send them home. The messages are all positive and talk about community and helping others. Get this game, it’s amazing and you’ll never get tired of it.
 
A lot of fun for everyone
Love fun games hospitals this is for you

Fun builder game, shows death but satirically, no blood/gore.
Game is very child-friendly and very fun for most ages in my opinion, game does show death and ghosts mildly, however there is no blood or gore in the deaths or in treatments/surgery/etc. All illnesses are also fake and comedic like a disease that turns you into a clown, or puts a light bulb on your head.
 
Great for kids!
its just like a bunch of action fuigures fightning not a bad game the story mode is great and i love everything about this game

Great graphics but awful lack of content.
This is without doubt the best graphics in street fighter games, but the lack of effort by Capcom put into this game is astoundingly disappointing, especially in arcade mode. In arcade mode each round is only one round and there are only 3 fights in a whole character story. There are only 16 characters without purchasing( you can purchase 7 characters which is disappointing compared to ultra street fighter IV ( 44 characters). Overall the only things good about SFV are the amazing graphics and enhanced combos. It also features mild violence, language and sexual images.

Street Fighter V: Champion Edition is the Definitive experience!
Street Fighter V Champion Edition is the same game, with all the previous content in one package. Violence is the main and obvious factor. Characters kick, punch, throw, scratch and bash each other. Animated blood is occasional but pretty mild. Characters grunt in pain and defeat. Language is mild. In story mode, use of "damn", "@$$", "p!$$" "hell" and "bastard" are heard. Sexuality is moderate. Female characters wear certain revealing clothing that emphasize their rather big breasts or butt.

VERY GOOD GAME, don’t use Laura or Mika.
One of my favorite games ever! Very good gameplay and very good story. I’ve only had it for a few days, and it’s the only PlayStation game I play! Some suggestive themes, like Laura and R. Mika’s clothes, but otherwise, very good, 9.9/10.

Ok game, not much to worry about content wise
I got this game for £8 on steam and think that's a good price . The game uses a free to play model meaning that to unlock extra characters you have to "buy" them with fight money (the in game currency ). As far as I'm aware, there's no way to buy fight money, you have to earn it through playing the game (or buy one of the season passes to unlock it all at once).
I don't mind this as I normally just play as ryu anyway and he (along with about 8 other characters) are avalible from the start.

As for stuff that parents might not like, well there's punching, kicking e .c.t along with unrealistic special moves. So unless you're like my dad and don't like the concept of punching in games, then it's mostly fine. All the characters have unrealistic and steriotypical and exagerated designs (especially in female characters). But I don't think it's anything too bad.
There's also online play but no voice chat (I think) and text chat is restricted to pre made messages. So while you can interact with other people, nothing bad can happen.
There is some language such as from birdie, a British thug type character who will say things like "bugger" but this is only heard when you KO him i also read in other reviews that some other mild swear words (like "ass" were used but i can't say myself
Inconclusion, the game is fine for everyone 10 and up (in my opinion) and possibly younger if there's an older sibling to makes sure things are fine .

Use your own discretion
This games review is pretty spot on. Many female characters are sexualized even to the point of comedy. My dad said of the character Rainbow Mika that she was "busting out of her bra" but honestly it's up to you whether you think it's too much. The gameplay is loads of fun, with new content added in updates every month in 2016. The meat of the game right now is in its online play- the current single player story can be beaten in an hour. A new cinematic story mode is coming which looks really fun. You have to be a member of PS Plus to go online if you didn't know. It disappointed me that online play wasn't free like in Nintendo games but I gave in and bought ps plus anyhow.

Worst game ever
What is good:The game has good graphics.

What's bad: For starters, I find the game really hard to play. It is just so difficult to use special moves. In addition to this, the move instruction manual is completely hopeless.I only figured out how to use a 'HADOKEN' 30 min into the game, plus, the 'easy' setting doesn't make a difference. last of all the characters make really unrealistic and actually quite creepy noises when they are hit.

Please don't get this game. I am only trying to save your money. Complete waste of money.

Staple suggestive themes and bare bones delivery mire a once 'must have' franchise.
For parents, read the Common Sense review as I won't reiterate the same points. As far as replayable content and controls, this is another fine rendition of very responsive and quick controls. Unfortunately, with the most bare bones delivery set in comic book form and the cutback of a huge part of it's roster with only a handful of new fighters, this is perhaps the most disappointing Street Fighter game to date. Although this title knows very little rivalry in quality, even in it's worst renditions, this was considered a step back and a letdown to most fans of the franchise. Also, after the crossover Street Fighter X Tekken game with it's 2 on 2 features and massive roster, this game conveys a comparatively minimalistic feel with a huge missing lineup of characters and modes found in previous games. Being a Playstation exclusive should not entice one to buy a PS4 console as SF4 and X Tekken were superior games despite the fact they are not as High Defintion, but they both more than make up for this in sheer content and replayability.

This game is definitely a great fighting game. Beginners can 'button mash' to victory, whereas more experienced players (like me) can string together advanced combos to win. A must-have for any gamer over 10.

Better then mortal combat! (Though that game is really good)
A all around fun game me and my 12 year old love this game! But sadly when ever we VS he usually beats me ):
