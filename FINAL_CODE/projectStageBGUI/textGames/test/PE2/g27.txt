Absolutely FANTASTIC game
There are a lot of terrible reviews for this game. I can see were people might not like the game, but in my opinion they aren't seeing the main point of the game. Let me start off by saying I am fourteen years old. This game really pushes the limits of violence for me, as every kill feels and looks really life like. There were a couple times I actually had to take a break from playing the game because I kept thinking about those violent moments and it made me feel kinda sick to the stomach. Overall tho not worse than Mortal Kombat but the fact that they made every thing feel and look so real is what pushed it for me. There is also lots of swearing, but nothing I haven't heard at school before. There is some drinking and one part where two characters smoke weed but it's not bad or anything. For sex and nudity, there is an part with implied sex between Ellie and Dina but it just shows them kissing before and in they're underwear after. There is also a part were it briefly shows to chapters having sex, and only a characters boobs are shown, nothing below the waist. Other than that there's not anything else I can remember. Now story wise (spoilers ahead) this game is a masterpiece, but is a flawed one. It is a very intense story about revenge. I really enjoyed the first and last third of the game, where you got to play as Ellie and see her story progress. In my opinion I did not like the second third of the game where you play as Abby. Although it felt needed to the story after playing, I kept finding myself wanting to go back to Ellie and her story, and was really happy once it did. Abby's section of the game seems dragged out a bit and I feel like it could have been shortened. The only other thing that I think would have been better is if Ellie got her revenge. It would have seemed more completed if she had killed Abby, it makes the long journey seem for nothing. After thinking about it a lot tho I now see why she didn't kill her. I think that Ellie realized that Abby was a parent figure to Lev, like Joel was to her. She remembered losing him and realizes that she doesn't want anyone else to feel that pain and suffering that she did. I still don't think Ellie's story is finished tho, with Dina leaving at the end and her not finally being happy, I think the next game should figure out a way to make her story finally be told and let me know that she is finally safe and happy, if there is a next game. I feel like this game is absolutely amazing and overall told an amazing and beautiful story. There were many moments where my heart was pounding and I felt like I couldn't breathe, which is something a game has never done to me before. After thinking in it I this is a ten out of ten game for me and you should definitely let your kid play this game and the first one so that they can experience this amazing story that will stick with them forever

Bad Game Concept with much violence
I personally like the last of us part 1, it’s theme was really good, about a man and his daughter. Although in the second game, the whole concept and the storyline is solely based on revenge and personally that’s not really a great story to tell.

Sequel to Zombie nature game is mature. Message about Violence
The last of us part II is the sequel to the 2013 video game hit. This sequel takes the player 15 years after the events of the first last of us. Putting players in the hands of Adult Ellie. The visuals of this game is beautiful and stunning as the first one. While the visuals are good and all. Is the violence in the last of us part II too intense for teens?

Violence = 9/10 (intense combat and killing)
The whole thing about the last of us basically involve lots of innocent people who die along the way. And revenge is involved in the story line itself. So expect plenty of intense combat scenes of gun shooting, bow shooting, blood and gore, graphic killings and injuries, and torture. Also there are zombies involved in this game so expect to see plenty of disturbing and disgusting looks of zombies such as zombies missing arms, legs, limbs, and even heads.


Language = 10/10 (strong)
Throughout cutscenes and the game itself there will be scenes of characters swearing and saying rude insults to each other. Language such as plenty uses of the F word, S word, and plenty of more swear words. All involving teens.

Sexual material = 6/10 (sex talk and activity)
There isn’t that much nudity nor sex. But there is one scene where two characters kiss and engage in sexual activity with both male and female nudity involved. And in another scene two characters kiss and fall onto the couch. The entire scene isn’t shown but it’s implied that they had sex.


Drug and alcohol material = 4/10 (brief)
The main character also known as “Joel” is shown drinking whisky in a scene. And Ellie and Dina find a room full of weed and smoke.

The game = 8/10 (fun,colorful, but not so good ending)
The game is so good I have never had so much fun playing a story game. Usually story games are Boring and have nothing interesting. But this one completely shows how a story game should be. The game is good and all but I feel like the ending of this game could have been stronger. That’s the only problem I have. Everything else was incredible! I recommend this game! It gives it a great message to players that revenge is bad.

Mature game for mature players
This game is more than just good. I personally think it's one of the best I've ever played. Everything about it is so much more detailed than the first game, and even that was impressive for something out of 2013. The gameplay, the combat, the graphics... Just. Chef's kiss. With that said, this game has seriously earned its PEGI-18 or Mature 17+ ratings. The combat is amazingly detailed, which means that violence is very much present and it is extremely graphic. I usually have no problem with in-game violence, but some scenes were too much even for me. The game does have a great message though, and despite its violent nature and the messed-up world, the characters have deep relationships with one another, which really does tone the intensity down at times. The characters also smoke weed, drink alcohol, swear and even have sex. Nothing too graphic too often, but one sex scene was definitely surprisingly out there. I would say this game is good to play for 17 year-olds, or mature 15/16 year-olds. Without spoiling too much, the game does have a deeper message which I've seen lots of players miss. Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this game a chance. Look deeper than the surface. I promise you, you won't regret it.

Amazing!
The Last of Us: Part II is about as good as games get. Stunning graphics, perfect acting, sound design, does justice to the first. Everything a good sequel or any game should be. It is a very Mature game, hence the rating. It contains intense violence and gore, more intended for older teens and adults or really desensitized 15 year olds. The gameplay itself has some bloody violence with guns and melee weapons. For a scene, two of the main characters smoke weed. There is kissing for several scenes. At one point, the most sexually mature part of the game, we briefly see female nipples and blocked intercourse for about 12 seconds. At one point, a female character takes her shirt off to tend to wounds, we only see her back and her shoulders. Not meant to be sexualized. There is heavy language, like the first game, including, but not limited to, the f word. Alcohol is shown, but mostly used as collectible supplies for health kits. The game has some really powerful and positive messages, including a message about inclusion an discrimination of people in a religion and people of the LGBTQ+ community. Story-wise, this game is amazing. Like the first. It hits you right in the feels like the first. But it is a very mature game, and parents should keep in consideration what their child is used to playing. If the maturity isn't much of a problem, the game is a must-play, especially for fans of the first.

At a concept of horror, to make feelings dark
This game I played was really horrific, and very entertaining and would give an example on some cases of the story and the gameplay itself so far.
During the past few days on playing the game, ‘started out with a message of hope from Joel on the strings of guitar I could always remember, in a personal look in a classic chain of the makings of Naughty Dog themselves through the wilderness of environment and atmosphere, instanced on the veining change of Ellie and her fearless outcomes over the growth of her strength and body.
Ellie and Joel back in the first game of The Last of Us was really good, and powerful for a complete game on a next PlayStation game to finally warship the controller on the edge of your seat, and also would too: congratulate the sequel of The Last of Us Part II through the whole adventure of a brutal violent discovery as it begun to at least finish of what has come to be its enemy of hers.
So if you wanted a short review, here it is, and would give an thank you for reading this ;)

This is rated for only mature audiences:
As a gameplay/movie/tv show/etc. it would be Rated NC-17 for:
substantial explicit amounts of extreme graphic disturbing violence with persuasive behavior including torture and disturbing sequences with visuals of gruesome gory images and some sexuality/nudity with strong language throughout

Very violent, but teens can manage.
I'm 13, and I was a little worried going into it, but overall I was fine. It's really violent, but the worst parts for me were when animals died. In the very beginning there's a really mangled dead moose, and later there's a cutscene where you stab a dog. These parts were pretty bad, but nothing unmanageable. In the middle of the game, there are scent dogs, but I got through without killing any of them. It just makes the game more difficult. There is a ton of swearing, but if that's the reason you're not letting your kid play this game then you're being optimistic. They've probably heard all these swears before either at school or hanging out with friends. The only other concerning part is there are 2 sex scenes. The first one has no nudity and is only implied, the second shows nude top halves. It's pretty graphic, and I skipped it, but as long as you know where it is it's fine. Just in case you're about to let your kid play it, (minor spoilers ahead), the scene is when Abby finds Owen at the boat. If you're not sure when this is, I don't want to spoil too much, so look it up.

Its a great game! You should get it if your kid is mature enough.
This game is amazing, and I loved it. It has a lot of shooting, but most of that is just shooting the zombies, there is violence shooting people but most of that is near the end. There is a sex scene but there is an option to skip it so you should be good. There is a lot of f-bombs and sh**t but if your kid is mature you could get this for them. Overall really fun and entertaining!!

Terrible story, mature stuff. Just look somewhere else
Excessive swearing? Yes. Blood and Gore? Yes. Explicit images of women? Yes. Do the characters smoke weed at one point? Yes. This game literally has it all. Just read the box. Also the story faced major scrutiny for doing some things wrong.

Good
The story is nowhere near as good as the original game, and the ending was mediocre, but the visuals are stunning, the gameplay is fun, and the cutscenes are enjoyable to watch. The game contains extremely graphic violence, strong sexual scenes and references, and use of very strong language, including scenes of drug use.

The Best!
I am 10 years old and played this game. It was amazing from start to finish. There is a lot of violence but it is not anything as bad as some other games.There is some romance but it can always be skipped in the only two cutscenes that have it. So therefore, I think it is good for anyone ten and up. But now i’m going to talk about how generally good the game is. Despite the mixed review, this game is overall stunning. It is about 25-30 hours long and is 100% worth no matter how much money you spend on it. It’s graphics are beautiful, it’s gameplay is stunning, exiting and intense. I recommend this game to anyone who has access to it. Even I did’nt have a PS4 when it came out but then i bought one to play this masterpiece. Take my word for it, and stop reading reviews. Just play the dang game.

Bad game with scenes that do nothing to the terrible plot
I wouldn't recommend this game to a single person. First of all, they added meaningless character traits that support nothing in the storyline. The second and worst part is the sex scene. Some games feature a scene where the characters get a little intimate, it normally has an influence on the story and is at least slightly important to the character development. This was not. This was an abomination of a scene. It lasts way too long, is useless to the already terribly boring plot, and just is super uncomfortable to watch. Please don't get this game. Not worth your time.

Found it very good - however it can be controversial
This game has a brilliant story - Joel and Ellie return and are done very well and also newcomers like abby are executed to a high standard. Controls are fairly simple.
However the marketing for this game is seriously misguiding and therefore the game can be controversial at certain events.
There's violence, there's swearing, there's sex. But the game gives the important message of violence not being good.

Violent, but good.
This game swears a lot and there is talking and a bit of showing of sexual interactions between Ellie and another female, nothing is shown. there is also use of weed. however it is a very amazing game and if you are able to play it you should.
