it has a ton of blood and gory but it is not that bad if you can handle gore like me than it is fine and you are a good guy that is really strong and kills demons from hell and it is really fun especially in this time at home but if you can't handle blood and gore then you should start playing it when your 14 or older

Great but dont expect mercy
This game is very fun, its gory, but cartoonish, although it can get very hard at moments, especially at the mid point of the game,so dont go in expecting a typical shootet because the game will test you.

great fun insanely addictive fps
first off let me say this. Doom eternal is a very gory bloody game... you rip off heads stab demons "basically zombies" and cut them in half with a chainsaw. that being said it is a great game super fun and great story with super fun game mechanics. I'm not going to tout the whole "if your kid is mature enough" bull you see on here all the time. No one should be playing this if they are squeamish. but fun Game 5/5

amazing
The violence is not that bad but the difficulty is crazy
you might be an ultra gamer but idc because for most ppl this game is hard
it is frustrating but satisfying once you have completed the level
The boss fights are hard and parkour is also annoying

Rip and Tear until it’s done.
Honestly, 10/10 game. I don’t understand some of the angry mothers talking about how it supports Satanism. Pretty sure this game has a VERY big anti-demon message(poor Olivia.).
The gore is pretty intense, but honestly, it depends on the person who plays it. Some people are better with gore than others, so do NOT let a kid play this if they have a weak stomach.
The game itself is amazing and was extremely fun. And the slight comedy in it is absolutely HILARIOUS!
Take care, and please dont shoot a hole into the surface of Mars.

Rip and Tear
No one would have thought that the remake of DOOM 2016 would be as good, nay, better than the original. But when id software launched DOOM ETERNAL on March 20, 2020, the naysayers were proved wrong. People believed DOOM 2016 was groundbreaking and maybe even the best first-person shooter in all of video-game history, how could id software possibly out-do themselves?
There has never been such a terrifying and amusing plot like Doom Eternal. The plot is appropriately complex, making you wonder what’s about to happen next, inducing you to keep playing just to find out.
In addition to the incredible plot in Doom Eternal, the gameplay, control, and movement are unique compared to all the different movement shooters. It's tight and responsive, helping you move around the area.
Last and most importantly, the soundtrack in Doom Eternal is so motivational and breathtaking. It comes at the right time and fits in perfectly with the mood of what's happening, whether it's a spooky or scary mood or a violent and fighting mood. The soundtrack makes the cut-scene feel more epic or maybe even more emotional.
You should definitely go purchase Doom Eternal!

Nice
Although you find blood and gore, you have to kill demons from hell and destroy the Khan Makr, if you fail and you have extra life, you'll win.

Gory video game, teaches teens that demons are bad.
Demons have invaded earth and the doom marine sets out to kill the icon of sin

Violence:
The violence is quite brutal but it’s unrealistic, so if your teen doesn’t rip someone’s heart out and make other children eat it then it’s fine because all bad violence is quick and doesn’t last long

Language:
There is none, not at all!

Extremely Fun, However Extremely Violent
This game is an amazing FPS action game that is very fun to play. However, the game revolves around a man named the "Doomslayer", who must protect humanity from a demonic invasion on Earth. Though his intentions are very good and heroic, he does use very violent (often times graphic) means to succeed. You kill demons with various means of weaponry and your fists and feet (only in Glory Kills). This can result in graphic bodily explosions, dismemberment, graphic stabbing, and some skulls getting smashed into the ground by Doomslayer like watermelons (all these being accompanied by sounds that might nauseate violence-sensitive players and kids, but not me). This game also may be a little to scary for little kids, due to the fact the games plot revolves around the forces of Hell killing everyone on Earth so they can take over it. There's no language, violence, or sex in this game whatsoever. Overall it's a really fun game, but should only be enjoyed by older, more mature gamers.

Looks fun
Haven't played it but seems fun

Great messages: Demons are bad, praise Jesus
Great role models: Protagonist kills demons
Easy to play: Protagonist is overpowered
Too much violence: Much but not too much

Gory great fun
This was the first of many games I bought and played over quarantine, and it was a great way to start. A ferocious, demon-slaying ride brimming with gory thrills, explosive weaponry, and awesome looking enemies. The arcade-esque color scheme and the fact that you kill demons instead of people lessens the impact of the violence a little bit. The story and online is lacking, but that doesn't matter. The only real problem is the scenes in between the combat. I love puzzles and exploration almost as much as action in games, but in this case it slows down the pace a little (one level in particular).

It's a VERY violent game
The game is super realistic with amazing graphics and a LOT of blood, you the main character has to kill demons in many ways like crushing their head ripping their body parts of and lots of different weapons like shotguns and chainsaws. Although it is a gory game as long as your kid knows the difference between right and wrong they should be okay playing this game

The greatest fps
Doom eternal is perfect.
Gameplay: the fast pace of this game makes it so that you feel both like a god and keeping on your toes. With the glory kill factor it keeps a way to make it even faster, just all around fun as a bun.
Story: A bit complicated if you read the codexes, but if you don’t it’s pretty straightforward. I won’t explain it, read a synopsis.
Rating: it is violent but it won’t effect your kids you moral panic parents. Also swearing? Seriously?
Buy it or i will steal your peanut butter

dont expect.....
dont go in expecting a game like overwatch with minimal gore. you play as a guy not just kicking, but dismembering demon butt. the only "swear word" in the game is hell. but if your child can handle uncanny demons being dismembered with a CHAINSAW then great game

it’s best doom game
there is a lot of blood especially when u glory kill ur enemies. the blood isn’t rly a problem if ur into FPS and gore. there is no swearing, sex, drugs or any of the sort. 1 thing that’s a little sad is that some of the enemies look u into the eyes and are like sad when u kill them.
