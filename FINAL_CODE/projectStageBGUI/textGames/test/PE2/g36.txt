 
Take it from someone who has actually played the game
Call of duty modern warfare 2 remastered is the remastered version of the 2010 call of duty modern warfare 2.
Now I have actually played the game myself so here are my thoughts....

His game is great and there is little to no blood and the graphics haven’t had the hugest update since 2010 so the blood is pretty unrealistic. Also there is NO gore which is great because in the original one there was quite a bit of it but the developers have taken it out this time so it’s not as violent. Also I see a lot of other parents talking about the mission “No Russian” were you are an American but you go undercover in a Russian team and go into a airport and shoot civivlians, and yes I’ll admit it this mission is pretty concerning but the best thing is.... IT CAN BE SKIPPED! And the multiplayer is absolutely fantastic! And in the multiplayer there is NO blood at all!

If you get this game for your child and they skip the “No Russian” mission I would recommend this game to kids age 11+

Mostly like a standard hollywood blockbuster
Modern Warfare 2 is a pretty tame shooter. The action is pretty over the top like a Michael bay movie with tons of explosions, set pieces and innumerable death counts; although death is always from a distance. There is some blood, but never any gruesome gore and very little language.

The only mission that is potentially concerning is "No Russia", where you participate in a terrorist shooting against innocent civilians. The mission isn't meant to glorify terrorism and only exists to vilify the game's antagonist, but it can be disturbing to some. This mission however can be skipped.

Modern warfare 2 remaster parental review
I think it’s fine to be honest I loved mw2 and the remaster makes it better but I wanna say a few things there is one mission no Russian where you go undercover as a Terrorist and you arrive at a airport with one of the main villains Vladimir Makarov and a couple of other people of his crew you start of in a elevator and then makarov informs his crew to speak American words to blame it on the Americans and you basically start world war 3 with the Russians and America you kill probably over 300 innocent people at the end of the mission turns out makarov knew you were a American and not a Russian there is a bit of language but it’s pointless to go over it is strong but it is not used frequently and there is another mission you can turn off blood in the graphics setting of the remaster SPOILERS ALERT
On a mission called loose ends Your general kills two of the main
characters on the mission End game you play as soap and at the end of the mission you pull out the knife your general stabbed in you and you throw it right in his eye causing him To die immediately this scene was pretty quick and only blood was shown No gore was shown

Seriously, parents! Don’t let your kids play this stuff!
Okay, first of all this game is NOT for kids under 16 or even 18! My 13 year old son wanted this game.




Yet little did I know about the disturbing violence, I got it for him.




I noticed that his aggression towards his siblings got worse. Then, my 12 year old son wanted to play it. I said Okay as long as he was with my 13 year old son.





I got tired of hearing “Wow, bro. Did you hear me shoot a Bitch with a sniper?”





I also got calls from the school saying their grades went down from A- to D+.




Eventually, I decided to try it out myself. I was shocked by the violence, blood and gore.




My suggestion for if your child is 15+ and wants this game is to not let them play this game on discord with strangers.

It’s okay for 12+
My 15 year old son wanted this game. At first, I didn’t know what to expect. Yes, there is violence, blood, swearing. Then, my 12 year old son wanted it. I said after I watched my other son play it for a bit. If you turn off some stuff, It can be a great game. Just make sure that your kids understand that that game can not be repeated in ANY way.

Unless little Jimmy is going around killing bystanders, this game is alright for kids.
Personally, this call of duty was more disappointing than the others. The closest you get to seeing someones head explode is when you slit the throat of a member of shepherds private army at the END OF THE F**KING CAMPAIGN (I want more violence in my fps games. Doom did a good job so why not you, CoD?). anyhow, onto the actually game. The blood is relatively tame (well, to me at least). Language is exactly what your children hear in pewdiepie videos. The story is fine, but come on, nobody paid any attention to it (except me). The mission that had the internet more crazy than a succubus after receiving a facial from Paul Short, no Russian is a weird one indeed. As a Russian woman myself, I don't really care for it. I don't like the mission because of the whole terrorism thing, I don't like it because not much really happens in the mission. You kill a bunch of people and Makarov puts a bullet in your head. That's all. Anyway, the game is good I would recommend it to anyone who likes fps games.

Pretty good
Yes. It is a very violent game, but what common sense media DOESN'T TELL YOU IS u can turn of the blood and language. Now if they have seen more than one R movies, and u r fine with it this game is okay for them to play but if u don't let them see RS, then just disable blood and they will be fine

Pretty good
A good campaign remastered, problem is that there is no multiplayer!!! Sure if I wanted to replay the game I'll go back to this, but still multiplayer has a toxic but fun community which is technically what fun with others online is built off.

Appropriate for kids and not that bad ;)
I played this game for myself and at first I thought it was too bloody and violent and too much cussing. However I realized you can turn off BLOOD and LANGUAGE. After you turn it off it’s very appropriate for children and makes it a lot more fairly safe for youths.

COD:MW2
Very violent remaster of a call of duty game, it is also bloody, and has lots of swearing but I would let teens play it.

Mediocre
The game is an ok remaster but the only thing available is the campaign! This is really disappointing to multiplayer fans like myself. The game is fine for kids. If your child has played a Call Of Duty game then this will be fine for them. The game at the moment is going for £20 which is a good price especially as new Call Of Duty games or about £50. Anyway, hope this review helped your decision!

LEGIT BLOWN AWAY!!
This game is great! The violence and language isn't a problem: the problem is the drugs. The main character has a drug addiction and at random points NEEDS methamphetamine or he'll begin going crazy and another charter smokes often. Drugs is a problem but it doesn't encourage foul play but its still a factor.

Hope this helps!!

Brilliant game
The game is amazing! One of the best!

Of course there is a bit of blood and language but its nothing more from what kids see anyway and besides, with the covid threat its great for kids to be occupied and stop their panic. Just a couple of ours to escape reality can make the biggest difference to them. Just let them have a bit of fun.

Massacre training
Artistry notwithstanding, it’s unbelievable that this game was “remastered” with the “No Russian” massacre mission included.

Terrific war game remaster with bloody war violence and and a disturbing scene.
If MW2 Remastered was a film, it would be rated:

R for war violence throughout, a prolonged sequence of extremely graphic and grisly terrorism and disturbing bloody images

Modern Warfare 2 remastered is truly one of the best war game remasters for one of the best war games ever made. Here is the parent review sorted into 5 categories:

VIOLENCE: As a soldier, you can and will shoot and kill enemies in combat, splattering a lot of blood on surfaces and pooling it on the ground under the victims body. The game also has intense and surreal moments of war where the protagonists are near death and in frightening life or death situations such as: The driver of your car is suddenly shot. A car blows up leaving you on the ground. In a boat, you fall off of a water fall. You and another man are suddenly shot, then lit on fire inside of a pit (non-graphic, offscreen)

Through all of that, the most graphic and violent moments in the game take place in “No Russian”, a mission in which you play as an undercover soldier trying to act as an ultranationalist for intel on terrorisim. In this mission, you walk into an airport with the ultranationalists and have the choose to shoot into through hundreds of innocent civilians. If you decide not to fire at them, you are forced to watch the bloody carnage. The victims of the attack crawl on the ground, shout, hide and cry. This mission is skippable without punishment.

At the very end of the game, you are disoriented and are holding a knife in hand. Despite this, you are tasked with killing a villain. On the way to the enemy, you can slit the throats of his men. When you reach him, he counters your attack and slams your face against the hood of a car then stabs you in the stomach. Then, you are forced to watch him and your friend fight to the death with their bare fists as you start to fall asleep. However, to save your friends life and kill the enemy, you have to pull the knife out of your chest and throw it into the enemies eye. This is a very bloody and graphic scene overall.

LANGUAGE: Very infrequent cursing and language on a PG-13 level. 3-4 uses of shit heard throughout, 1 fully audible use of fuck at the very end. Stronger language heard in Russian.

Drug content: None in this remaster

SEXUAL CONTENT/NUDITY: None in this game

TOBACCO/ALCOHOL: Some smoking of cigars.

OVERALL: 13+
