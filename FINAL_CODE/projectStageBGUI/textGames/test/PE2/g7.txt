Disgusting - should be banned
Two awful awful parents exploiting their son for financial gain. Hours and hours of awful videos which are just selling their awful cheap line of line of merchandise to my young children. Shouldn’t be allowed to push their rubbish toys onto children like this. And don’t get me started on ... continue reading

Useless
I cannot stand this show. They use their child's name but it seems to be his mommy's show. You can tell how fake it is and that it is strictly for financial gain. There is nothing beneficial about this show for anyone's child.

And personally I do not want my child to idealise a criminal ... continue reading

Exploitative, cynical money-grabbing scam
Meaningless content designed to brainwash kids into begging their parents to spend ridiculous money on toys equivalent in quality to what you'd find in a Christmas cracker. Vile to the core.

Undercover advertising
It's aggravating. It pushes spending especially of their brand of toys, which are cheap and over priced at best.

I have never seen such mind bending rubbish in all my life. Ryan's mother does nothing but scream, you'd never believe she was once a teacher. The toys are utter rubbish and cost a fortune. If I could erase this channel I most certainly would

My son loves the show! The low reviews are because they didn’t think of it first! Our kids play with toys anyways, why not have them saving for their future while doing it !

Don't buy! You'll regret it if you do.
This product was a filled with mostly cheap filler plastic and more plastic containers.
Items inside the small containers are very poor quality (like any of the Ryan's toys), cheap and some have barely anything inside.
It's a polluting nightmare if non recyclable plastics are your concer ... continue reading

This is capitalism at work. One of the worst atrocities on the internet, targeted at easily influenced kids.

My son who is 6 years old has been infatuated with Ryan’s world. At first I didn’t mind him watching the shows, they seemed to do a lot of science experiments.

Don't let your kids watch

Mother acknowledges only two kids.
For the better part of a year I've been monitoring how ofter the mother mentions "Emma" and how often she says her other daughter's name. In fact, she seems to say "Emma" obsessively and maybe once in the span of a video can she remember she's got another daughter named "Kate". There a ... continue reading

So I am a babysitter, not a parent but the 3 y/o I was watching was watching one of Ryan’s videos. It was about Ryan’s mom (NOT a fan of hers) pretending to be a thief and stealing his toy and chocolate coins during Ryan’s ‘nap’.

This is awful. One of the slime making episodes is nothing more than the mother trying to get Ryan to behave and not act like a spoiled brat.
