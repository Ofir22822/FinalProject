More Ryan airtime less of his Mother PLEASE!!
My little boy loves Ryan and talks about him constantly but can something be done about his mother PLEASE!!! Her voice is like a Bloody chainsaw revving up and down with loud screeches akin to a Banshee. All she does is position toys to be sold and has no other purpose. When Ryan first started it was about Ryan now the show has become about her airtime and not Ryan. Can someone please tell her to go back into the background!

How does this have more than 1 star?...
Saving myself the typing by saying that I agree with the same thing that every other parent here is saying.. Wouldn't ever let my children watch this garbage. I have no idea how this is so "popular"...

Awful
Stupid show. My 5 year old is exponentially whinier and acts up more after watching this dumb show. I have taken away the iPad but the damage is done. The Ryan toys are also crap. Their shows ate giant commercials for them to peddle this junk as well. The putty from the giant egg left a large stain on my carpet.

New toys brought out in Australia
Bought a new toy and the colouring didn’t even last 2 hours. The name Gus rubbed off not even 30 minutes later and with a special needs child you can imagine how this turned out. $10 for a squishy toy, I expected more. Not very happy.

Be like Ryan’s Parents
Spend time with your kids and play with them! This family is a genius. You can hate them all you want, but they are not forcing you to watch their show, or buy their stuff! Lol. Take control of your family’s values and don’t depend on youtube. Anyways, that’s all! Don’t forget to subscribe! Lol

Doing it RIGHT
I honestly am a big fan of this channel and this family i don't know what the hell these people are thinking saying it's uneducational I watch every single episode with my daughter and don't see any of this as dirty or inappropriate as for the being greedy part this is just a blessed family living their BEST LIFE with their children so stop hating or being envious because they are happy and making money. I'm pretty sure they do donate you don't know what they do . My daughter loves Ryan and I love to see them travel and go places it's very interesting they do alot of family time it awesome!

Can the mom just please STOP TALKING???
My kids ABSOLUTELY LOVE Ryan and his toy reviews, however everytime I let them watch it all I can hear is the piercing sound of his mother's laughing and commenting. It really puts me off from turning the videos on for my kids. Please either stop talking on the videos or learn some volume control because I'm not the only parent that thinks this way. Ryan, however, is adorable and I love seeing him play and share his thoughts on toys.

A waste of money
They toy are cheap as ever and a chocking hazard. They want $40 for an egg that has $10 worth of crap. The slim stained my couch and alot of my sons clothing that doesnt want to come out. Save your money and your childs brain its a waste. They persuade u into buying toys that they are getting for free thru YouTube. They making money off play with toys like cime on nah they make anyone famous nowadays. Hope they remove it off youtube for good. Ive been trying to block this channel for months now. And tips on how. The views dont need to go any higher period

Reality Check
I truly like the innocent old fashion play. However, I am a widow and had my first child at the age of 42 years old . His dad died one month after his first birthday. My point is ; my son really enjoys this show . I and many parents can’t nor have time to play with there kids. I play with him but not at the level of Ryan’s parents. My son thinks everybody should be like Ryan’s parents. These people new what they were doing. I am pretty sure they have a maid! It’s just not real!!! These people have money and had money before the YouTube toy reviews. I can’t answer my son when he says “ where is daddy and why can’t we play all day” . Coolest for them making a ton of money and wondering how many toys they donate and who they donate too.., they have family that also got rich from this! My son asks “ why can’t we do that? I build houses out of card board for him and we paint. Never enough, my son will stop this Ryan stuff! It’s just unrealistic!

I really dont understand all the bad reviews if you dont want your kid to watch Ryan's toy reviews because it doesn't teach them anything just block the channel turn off the TV, tablet, computer and teach them play with them. Ryan's toy reviews it's like any other cartoon or shows for kids. yes it makes money like any other show I dont understand why is everybody mad for that, or are they mad because it's not them making the money.we should all know a lot of parents take their kids to commercials,shows,pageants,modeling and nobody it's mad for that.i personally let my kids watch Ryan's toy review and izzy's toy time for a little bit of distraction when they are done with their activities am not expecting/waiting for a show to teach my kids, just like dancing with the stars it's not going to teach me anything. in my opinion rayans and izzy's toytime are way better than other kids channels.

Incredibly Obnoxious
Mindless videos of the kid and his parents playing with toys and singing songs is like nails on a chalkboard. I thought I was ahead of the game when I blocked the channel, then we discovered the channel "Gus the Gummy Gator". Also the same family but with an alligator costume. Ugh.

My child has austism he is 6 years old before Ryan’s toy review he was completely non-verbal and I had never heard him laugh he would never watch tv and was always very frustrated, since watching this program on a daily basis he laughs everyday has a small vocabulary he actually loves watching it which is a massive achievement for him I can’t thank Ryan and his family enough it clearly is educational if they can teach and Autistic child some colours and to say a few words there doing a great job, plus Ryan has the best childhood what child wouldn’t want to play with his family

Nothing but a business.
Ryan and his parents are making money off of your kids by advertising to them and exploiting the viewer's trust. He is literally shoving toys up your children's throat. This is practically brainwashing. When my daughter was watching Ryan she said she wanted toys, and wouldn't stop wining unless I bought them for her. After I made her stop watching Ryan she was back to normal again.

A money-making channel with no learning purpose
This channel is suggested to my kids and ever since then one of my kids got addicted. I tried to be patient at first but the more content I see, the more I think this channel is useless for any kids’ learning. All you do is to see Ryan playing with his parents and sisters. There is zero learning and is basically a waste of your kids’ time. Watching too much TV is bad to start with for our eyes. Using my iPhone to watch something educational is fine, but Ryan’s Toys Review channel along with the other channels this family create (EK Doodle featuring Ryan’s twin sisters) is a pure waste of your kids’ time. I wouldn’t recommend this channel to any family with kids. So what if Ryan is cute, so are my kids. I can also film my kids playing and unboxing toys and then put the videos online. Just because a channel features a child doesn’t mean it is educational and useful for any purpose. This channel has zero educational value and is ruining my kids’ eyesight.

Silly Suburban Parents
I'd like to comment on the people complaining. If you don't like your kid watching the show, block it. You are entitled to do whatever you want with your kid (except for abuse). The problem with the complaining is this.... no one held a gun to your head and made you download the youtube app, or even watch the platform. These Ryan Toy Youtubers are just doing what everyone else is doing on youtube, trying to get views. Youtube used to be a community platform, now people can actually use it as a source of passive income. You are all complaining because you are lazy and extremely jealous. You won't read a book, or take a class, to learn how to have the life the Ryan has. Imagine a life where you don't have to work and you can actually give your kids a full life without always telling them, "No honey, we can't afford that..." That would be WONDERFUL if everyone could do that. But not everyone can, because not everyone is willing to put in the work. IF you don't like Ryans show, go to the LIBRARY and rent some EDUCATIONAL DVDS and put them in a DVD player, then, no youtube. But don't complain for your own parenting, that's on no one but YOU! Also,.... I should question how spoiled your kid is if they have their own tablet....psshhhhh....

Worst show ever. There is nothing stimulating or educational for kids. The parents are kids and sorry Ryan, you have nothing motivational and no personality. Not sure how you got onto national television.
Have your kids read a book instead , or color or go outside, play dough, pull your hair out, snuggle with your mom.

I just think you tubers are a different type of entertainment not meant for tv. They aren’t actors... and now, this show seems sterile and boring compared to the YouTube channel... Which btw I also think is annoying, and have a hard time understanding why my 3 year old could watch Ryan for endless amounts of time. He loves this new TV show too now.
But on YouTube it seems more entertaining.
I actually think the Dad is the star.
My rating is a 1 on Nichelodeon, but probably a 2 on YouTube!, My sons is probably a 5, on both... but it’s definitely better on YouTube then Nick.

Seriously Nickelodeon?!
WHY am I seeing the obnoxious Ryan’s Toy Review family on Nickelodeon? It’s not enough that they’ve infiltrated our electronic devices but now our televisions too. My kids are watching Paw Patrol and all of a sudden Ryan’s Toy Review comes on after and I cringed, they are as annoying on tv as on YouTube. Why is Nick encouraging these buffoons? Just STOP!

My daughter loves it. Even when I go to my friends house, rayan is on in their TV.
Especially, Ryan’s mom is so annoying. Her voice is really makes me mad. Like I want to kill someone. Dad is good.
The video recording is also so bad, that makes me dizzy. I wonder if it is impacting to my kid.

Mass Marketing
I've never had an issue with my children watching Ryans' Toy Review, especially when they focused on the outdoor play videos - it gave my own children ideas for imagination play and games they could do with friends. As of late, I've noticed that for every birthday, or special event, the family rolls out all of Ryan's products ,marketing the toys to our kids. It seemed subtle at first, but now it's every where and the intent is clear that the parents have given in to their greed. I thought seeing Combo Panda and the other new characters were great! They even stated that it gave Ryan a way out of making youtube videos. It gave them more product to push in almost every single new video - it lost it's original purpose. Even if you cave to the toys, more specifically the mystery eggs, it's a waste of money. You could spend upwards to $100 + on the large egg just to be left disappointed and astounded at the three small, dollar-store-cheap, weak plastic toys. This family is using their child for financial gain and is openly ripping off families who choose to spend their hard earned money on a toy they could have picked up from dollar tree. And now their son is not only making youtube videos, he's newly contracted under Nickelodeon.

exploiting children
The toy review YouTube channel isn’t that great, there’s no reason for it. Their toys in Walmart are very expensive and you can tell they aren’t thoughtful of their fans. $25 for a toy game that isn’t great material and horrible instructions. Definitely better games out there for way cheaper. And not to mention their very glitchy game app. Very expensive coins as well and there is no way to earn them for free. You can tell they aren’t thinking about their fans who got the there they just want money money money

Not just toy reviews
I love this channel. Yes my daughter adores it but I’m so glad she does. They not only review toys, which is great because it keeps my daughter from ever having a fit at the store. She also learns so much from this show. How tornadoes are formed, density of objects, heck she even knows how to extract iron from cereal. No it doesn’t sound like a lot but for a 5 year old she really is showing an interest in science and math. We even have contests in our house. I see a lot of reviews about the moms voice or using their kid, but I don’t know any parents that spend this much time with their children playing and learning. Keep them coming. We love the eggs. The stick on tattoos need to be manufactured better because they never go on clean. The putty is amazing. Please just sell these individually in tiny eggs. Slime is too slimey. But hey, we try to keep it to the kitchen. I don’t care what anyone says, if you can make a profit off spending time with your kids, do it!

I saw one episode were the boy and his mom were pulling pranks on the father while he slept. I thought it was a bad influence on kids. Plus I’d rather have my kid play with his own toys instead of watching some other kid play with toys.

the worst thing to plague youtube.
this stupid brat gets hundreds of toys a week with the mother just rolling in cash with the sponsorship money, i bet ryan has no self-awareness or any clue on how to do anything, the annoying voiced parents just want the money. Also. They. Put. A. 2. Second. Pause. Between. Words. Like. This.
im like bitch my son can hear fine, if i could give this a -5 star review, i would. ryan is an example on how dumb downed our society is.
