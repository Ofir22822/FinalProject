Really ehh game
Idk the games ok I’m not a huge fan but the M rating is there for a reason.

age 6+ 
Good game, terrible age rating
How on earth did this game get rated 10 and up. It has no blood, no death is shown upon crashing, and no language, except for maybe online but I have not heard anyone swear yet so it’s fine. Even in CSM’s own review, they state this, but they include consumerism which is what I believe led them to rate it 10 and up, but that’s still dumb because the only consumerism is from cars and child is able to buy a car obviously.

age 17+ 
Violent and blood and gore
It is rated for esrb mature

Misfired Criticism
For the most part, CSM hit the nail on the head with this review, giving it 3/5 stars due to its numerous technical flaws. However, I think it's important to point out that this game was made by one man. Literally, one singular dude designed, programmed, and developed Bright Memory. The game stands alone as a testament to his achievements, and for that I would grant it an extra star. Had it been developed by a studio, it might've been flawless.

I love this game
I love this game more than Odyssey, the story is deeper with more purpose and there is more to the game as well. It’s an adventure of honour, loyalty and starting new. You upgrade your village, help your friends and make alliance's with other viking groups and you go on raids and take down a network of bad guys.

I think this game is suitable for 14+ but if they’re too immature for the sensitive topics then absolutely turn the censors on.

There is a lot of violence, obviously. But I found that I didn’t notice the gore, you’re too busy running away to notice the blood or a too-small flying head.

Sexy Stuff - there is a cut scene in a brothel but there is only one topless women, she is the heavier chested women but nothing over average. You can also see sex sort of camera and in the background, but it isn’t graphic at all. You also see men in their undies. It’s not heavily sexualised and very toned down, which I appreciate.
You can also romance characters but you don’t see anything.

Drugs, there is drug use, sometimes accidental but it isn’t glorifying or anything.

There is swearing but not too much.

Amazing Game, Great Messages
This game has many great messages such as the only honorable way to die is in battle, so if you didn’t die in battle your a coward.

Some tweens/younger teens can handle
My 12 year old asked recently for this game. I wasn’t so comfier blue with an ‘M’ game at first because the hasn’t played very much violent games, but I thought he was mature enough, so I got it for him. Then, my 10 year old asked to play this. I said when I watch him play this for a few weeks. Then, I realized it’s an amazing game! If your kid has played Overwatch, they are definitely ready for this!

The Best game for teens and pre-teens!!
This game may seem not to appropriate on the outside but when you dive into the game it is a jewel that I think all kids should learn about because Vikings are part of the world's ancient culture. There is some blood but if your kids watch Avengers then there is no problem. I think this is a great game and is appropriate for most Teens and pre-teens!!

Assassin's Creed Valhalla
Assassin's Creed Valhalla is separate in the Assasin's Creed world. It is the first title in a new series. This particular game has a fair amount of blood but that can be turned off in settings. As far as scariness it is about a medium on a scale.
It has great music and is very realistic to what Vikings did back in the old days. There is singing, fighting to protect your territory from other Viking clans, and most importantly great scenery. Graphics are absolutely amazing and you completely control everything in the game. It's like a choose your own adventure book but in the Viking age. If you or your child has watched things like Avengers: Endgame or any of the Avengers movies Assassin's Creed: Valhalla will be OK. The only big thing is the scariness and that's pretty much it. I hope this will help you!

Seems fine as you can turn of blood, gore, nudity, esc with the right settings its fine for anyone

It is historically accurate and I think that it would be great for your kid to play it. Make sure they can handle violence and it has some scariness so make sure they can handle that but overall it is a great game.

Love it so far
This game is amazing here is my review for all the categories
Sex 2/5 There may be some nudity but you just hit like two buttons to turn it off
Violence 5/5 Lots of blood and gore if you don’t like your kid seeing that stuff don’t let them play
Language 4/5 Some f words but not frequent
Drinking, drugs and smoking 3/5 Smoking and drinking are part of the game
Positive messages/role models 1/5 Not really any of those but when you raid a village you can’t kill innocent civilians
Overall great game recommended for kids 12+ That can handle violence

Good game
It is amazing what it can teach you and I recommend it to everyone looking for a good game to play that is not to complicated but still enjoyable.

age 14+ 
The masterpiece returns and so does Virgil
Still teen friendly. Fantasy violence with blood. Next-Gen delivers the performance this game deserves.

Easy Game
The game is too easy oops accidentally did it blindly in a pretty quick time.
The best thing since torn with your hands bread
UNDERRATED it's a masterpiece it REALLY is i cannot express just how much good this GAME is it's so good AND it deserves to be recognized for how good it is and YOU will never play somethinglike this again boi

age 15+ 
Nice game
I think little hope is definitely safe for people 15 and up it uses a bit of vulgar language and there are some bloody scenes.Oh,and it’s also pretty spooky.But other than that there’s nothing really unsettling about it.And I think that it’s good for ages 15 and up.

Great
This game is amazing the jump scares are great I’m 13 and I felt comfortable playing and played with a friend who is also 13 we both got a really scared by the jump scares but it isn’t to bad. But don’t let ur kid play by him or her self it is very scary without a friend but I would recommend this game.
age 10+ 
Brilliant game,it’s ok for kids.
I think this would be more entertaining for kids than adults. I mean it is ok for adults to play but I really don’t think they would be interested. As the game controls aren’t very sophisticated and neither is the games story, I think it would be interesting still for 10 and younger but the amount of swearing is why I put the age limit where it is. The online isn’t coming out until December 2020 but when it does come out, I expect it is going to be great. Like watch dogs 2, this game is a masterpiece. Highly recommend to anyone.

Um . . .
So I watched a youtube video of people playing this and the second I saw the graphic punch and very realistic graphics, I turned the video off. It is something I surely would not ever want to play, but it is definitely something many people would want to play. But, I would not recommend this to any kids. It is too violent. However if you are a grown-up and this is your kind of thing, I think you would love this game.

Great game, but not for children under 13
The game is really good and I personally have it and im 16, but kids 13 down should not play this game because there is quite a lot of violence and cussing. But overall the message of the game is pretty good.

Stunning game.
Although there maybe a fair amount of strong language it is nothing more than they fit into a 12 rated film, this is the same for most of the gore and weaponry, as long as your child isn't actively looking for in appropriate references they will not find any

Really Good Bootleg GTA for ALL AGES!
At first, most people think that it is a bootleg GTA V brand game. But it's not. Maybe it has some similarities with GTA, but you have more tasks, and it is very fun to play with friends.

Great graphics, decent story, mediocre gameplay.
Watch Dogs: Legion consists of a relatively large open world based on London, the story consists of you having to take down and investigate Albion, a private corporation that replaced the police after the fictional London bombings, and other companies such as Blume, and another hacker group that caused the bombings and has believed to have ties with Albion.

The graphics are great in my opinion, and the story is a major improvement from WD2 (I haven't finished it yet though), as I wasn't a fan of the immature cringe storyline of WD2, as it was a major shift in tone then the first game which I still do like a lot, although, this game seems like a significant downgrade over 1 and 2 gameplay wise, the hacking (which is what the entire WD series is about) has been severely downgraded in my opinion, removing the ability to hack traffic lights, steam pipes, and other hacks that were standard in the last 2 games, the police/Albion are useless, unlike the last 2 games you can escape them almost instantly, are they blind?, enemies loose you immediately when you exit the restricted area unlike going in a car chase like the other WD games, maybe due to the lack of road hacking, and the PC optimization isn't great either, although I've come to expect this from Watch Dogs games, I assume they'll fix it later, the story does include more elements from WD1 then 2, such as sex trafficking, and other topics that may not be suitable for everyone, I have played about 75% of the main story, and from what I see, you should hold off from buying it until it becomes more of a stable game, and maybe wait for a discount too. The driving in this game seems way too easy, the cars are very light unlike in past Watch Dogs games, I assume because people complained about the hard and annoying driving from the first game.

The play as anyone system is unique, and it's alright, if you do die though, you need to wait 60 real life minutes to play as the character again if you have permadeath off, and if you're going to play the missions non stealthy, get a operative that already has guns, as you cannot buy guns from a gun store, other then 4 other guns that aren't that great, and 3 of them are non-lethal, and forget picking up guns from enemies, that's just not possible at all, and the NPC AI seems to worse then WD2, they just seem overall more broken.

Overall, I still prefer Watch Dogs 1, but its a major improvement over Watch Dogs 2 story wise.

Great Game!! For 12 and up
Great for mature 12 year olds. A lot of F bombs and other types of curse words. A little graphic but not to bad. Your main concern should be the language. It tells you to stand for what you believe and your rights which are some positive messages. There is drinking but it’s london so what did you expect. But overall AWESOME GAME!!

this game is a great game for semi-mature children
this game is about a resitence againt a facist militia that has taken over london and it is your job to protect london, i believe this game is completely fine for mature 12 year olds and definitly fine for 13 year olds this game has a good message which is that facist militias are really bad and every citicen should stand up agianst overreaching far-right goverments

This game is perfectly fine for kids 11+
The game has no sex at all and little to nothing bits of swearing in some cutscenes. I recommend this game to everyone who likes GTA 5 type games like myself. Don't hesitate to let your kids who are 11+ because they will really like the game and never see sex.
