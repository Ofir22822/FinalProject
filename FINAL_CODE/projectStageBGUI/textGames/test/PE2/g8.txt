Bloodless violence in well made prequel to Breath of the Wild.
Parents need to know that this fantastic adventure is a great follow up to the fantastic open world game known as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I highly agree with Common Sense Media's review for Breath of the Wild. This game has lots of action. You use swords, axes, spears, a ... continue reading

Best Zelda game in a while!
An amazing new Zelda experience! Great gameplay and story! This is not like most Zelda games though, but that’s no reason to skip out!

The reason this game is rated T isn’t because of the violence, but the AMOUNT of it. You’re pitted against huge hoards of enemies that you have to try t ... continue reading

Fun and Slightly Challenging
Overall this game is great! It has an easy style of game play and an interesting story. There is basically constant action through and nearing the end it gets kinda challenging, but it still remains fun! If you are looking for another Breath of the Wild this isn’t it. It has main story s ... continue reading

While my 3 year old loves this channel, my husband and I can't stand it. There's really no purpose to it, and the mother's voice is so extremely loud and obnoxious even when we have it set to the lowest volume on his tablet it is still extremely loud.

Ryan's Toy Review is like trash reality tv for small children. It seems to be addictive for kids yet has no real substance. The mother's voice is the single most irritating, obnoxious noise I have ever heard in my life.

Your child will learn nothing but bad things from Ryan Family Review
This family should be reviewed for child labor laws. Your child will learn nothing from this youtube family. They brag about their income by showing trips and their new pool, etc.. They open oy eggs just to throw them aside and not play with them. The mother and father say the dumbest things, wrong facts and spell things wrong.. I cant stand this show and I wish youtube will block them.. They post the trashiest videos also.
