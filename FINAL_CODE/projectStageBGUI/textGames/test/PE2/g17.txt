Mildly violent and sometimes frustrating
Oddworld is mainly focused on puzzling through levels. With funny humour, the game is also very smart. Violence is minor. You do not fight regularly. You can possess other enemies to kill one of their own which leads to them exploding afterwards into chunks with blood.

A well-made and well-designed mildly violent puzzler
Oddworld: New n' Tasty is a challenging platformer where you play as an alien called Abe who's species is in slavery. You attempt to escape, while aiding as many of your fellow slaves to escape as well. There is a heavy, but not atrocious amount of violence, eg farmed animals attacking and eating you, falling into meat grinders, hitting land mines etc. If your child is sensitive to decent amounts of violence and a little gore, wait a year or two more. Otherwise, if your child likes puzzlers and mildly violent games, this is an immediate win-win. Or if your child likes thrillers and puzzlers, and is ok with violence, also a win-win situation. I reccomend this to 11+ kids!

It's entertaining and challenging.
The game requires lots of skill for kids and adults alike, but it's very much worth it. The game follows a bipedal, strange looking alien (Mudokon) named Abe (or Stitch-Lips if you're feeling cruel) and his adventures to free himself and his friends from enslavement and being turned into lunch. The game tests your ability to solve puzzles, how good you would probably be at I-Spy, and, sometimes, your morals (if you're that bad of a person.) The game has plentiful amounts of black comedy, and can make you laugh and feel bad about it 5 minutes later. Sadly, the game lacks this quality halfway through the game once Abe puts on his big boy shorts and goes back at the facility to finish the job. The game can be very violent, and unforgiving. The gore won't make you vomit or enter another room, as they're *almost* just blobs or meat chunks. The enemies die in a singular hit, but the problem is so can you. The game also includes multiple endings, and the good ending requires hard work. If you're aiming for a perfect ending, don't bother- it's nigh-impossible and takes about 3 months to complete. I, myself, am heading down the bad ending because I'm bad at this game. Don't let your kids see the bad ending. Ever.

In conclusion, it's a good game. The meaning behind the game is also pretty amazing. Buy it. Buy it for your kids. Buy it for your dog. Buy it for your pet rock.

Just as good as the original!!
I've been playing the the original Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee my whole life, and this remake stays true to it!! It's got all the same scenes, except revamped and even more gorgeous!! (Which is also kind of a downside, though, because the bad graphics made the original so much creepier) Definitely worth every penny!!

Good horror
I think it’s a good horror game, but you need to focus very much. It’s very terrifying, horrifying. That’s why I rated this game for 15+.

I've played this game and its very fun. the Amnesia franchise is very good. there are some nude corpses but your kid probably already knows what that looks like and what it is by 11. Very good game I recommend it to anyone.
VERY good game
the game has a little bit of frustration due to the permanent death, which makes you start over, but overall, quite fun. the people who rated this game sound like they haven't ever ripped through the world with an explosive laser beam an then killed the boss by spraying acid on it. the role models aren't great, but any kid who understands make believe things won't really follow in the characters' footsteps, i mean, the main character doesn't even SAY anything. not like you could go wrong there... great game, a bit annoying when you die, but also a good game to wean addicted children off of gaming.
Great!!!
REALLY GOOD, IMAGINE PLAYING ON A SCREEN THAT IS ACTUALLY IN YOUR HOME!

Fun but design improvement for Nintendo Switch

same thing
To be honest there is norhing in this game that isnt family friendly, just 2 starts cause it has been the same thing for 5-6 years.

age 6+ 
It's realistic but not that realistic

age 8+ 
Rated PG (frequent mild violence, threat, mild bad language).
SEX/NUDITY - None. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are frequent sequences of mild violence and action, which usually are very cartoonish and have strong comical elements. PROFANITY - There is infrequent use of mild language ("bastard", "ass"). DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - None. THREAT/HORROR - There is a sustained sense of mild threat and intensity throughout, although it is contextualised by the game's cartoonish and humorous nature. Some sequences, such as when Crash is chased by a dinosaur, may frighten very young children.

PG - Parental Guidance, some moments may be unsuitable for young children. Contains mild content, generally suitable for children aged 8 years and over.

A game for the older Crash fans, kind of
(This review contains spoilers)

I've been a huge Crash fan ever since I was a kid and this game was really enjoyable for me, it has everything I wanted in a Crash game - new powers and playable characters that nonetheless don't get in the way of the game's core (platforming, collecting boxes and fruits and such), challenging yet fun gameplay and fun cartoony antics of the lovable Crash and his friends and even foes...

That said, this game isn't very beginner friendly if you haven't played the previous games and the story and the characters have slightly more edge to it than in the previous games.

The game is almost as hard (if not as hard or even sometimes harder) as the first game, which was already pretty difficult, especially if you are trying to 100% it. If your child is patient and can handle hard games, it shouldn't be a problem, but it's important to keep in mind.

As for the slightly inappropriate content...

Violence/Scariness: The violence is very cartoony, there is no blood and while some parts may be scary to younger kids (like the levels where Crash/Coco are running from the T-Rex), they aren't extremely scary or anything. That said, the game very clearly states that there is at least one timeline where Crash and Coco died and it's shown that their friend Tawna still misses them, which could be potentionally upsetting.

Bad language: The game contains words like "bastards", "kickass", "bloody", "buggers", "bollocks" and "hell". One of the skins is called "Mother Clucker". At one point, Cortex (the main villain of the franchise) almost says that he wants to shove something up another character's butt, but is interrupted.

Sex: Nothing explicit, but the game is filled with some innuendos and jokes that were clearly more aimed at adults. There are levels called "Booty Calls" and "Rock Blocked", as well as a skin called "Big Horn Energy". Also, there is a scene where two characters flirt with each other in a rather suggestive manner (which is even worse when coupled with the fact that they are alternate universe versions of themselves).

So yeah, while the game is still cartoony and fun, younger players may need some parental guidance. However, if your kid is fine with a bit of difficulty in their games, some swearing and some dirty jokes, they shouldn't have problems with this game.
