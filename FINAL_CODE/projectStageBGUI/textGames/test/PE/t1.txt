Dynamax Ruins The Game For Everyone
A very good game
Long time fan and parent
An epic new adventure!
Disappointing.
Still not worth the money but has been improved...
It's fun for kids like myself it's a favourite
It's a great game with some kid friendly messages mixed in.
Note: I do not own a Nintendo Switch, and I do not intend to purchase one. Parents need to know that SWSH does not feature Mega Evolution or Z-moves, gimmicks from the previous generations' metagames. Furthermore, transfer from Gen VII is currently not possible. Dynamax ruins the balance of Pok?mon, and the new Galarian forms outshine other Pok?mon. One good note about SWSH is at least Gyms had returned instead of Island Challenges. I give this game a 2 out of 5.
Pok?mon sword and sheild are the best Pok?mon games ever bede is a very good character he is a good character
Ive been playing Pokemon since 1997 and over those 22 years ive seen some big and small changes to one of the main game fraancises i love. I started out with the anime in 1997 and got yellow for my birthday the next year and have never looked back. What I love about this francise is how kid friendly it is and some of the values it teaches of friendship and careing the anime values as well as every time anew game comes out with new pokemon it challenges the player even more to think stratagy and how this would work with this move and so forth. In other words get kids heads thinking and helping to learn how to stratagise. A usefull skill to have in this everyday world. Now ive heard of the bugs and the glitches but im still looking foraward to really playing the copy my wife got me for christ,mas. and this thing about not all the pokemon being in it? Didnt red and blue just start out with 150? Besides pokemon home is comeing out next year and i dont think itll be forever that we will not asee the missing pokemon in game. After all dont they patch up games all the time and update them on the switch? What im trying to say is if anyparent asks me the number one kid safe game to play my first answer is always pokemon. To me its the number 1 computer game for all ages for everyone to enjoy
As usual, several female characters are scantily clad in two-piece swimsuits or similarly revealing clothing.
I'm just gonna start off by saying that while I thought $60 was a bit overkill, this game was definitely worth the wait. This game may not have had anywhere near a complete pokedex, but it had plenty of new pokemon of unique designs and movesets and two new legendaries to catch. The character designs and humor in the game was also very well done. The dynamax battles were very fun and engaging and the graphics were very beautiful and polished and definitely not glitchy. After beating this game, I have to say, it was a very enjoyable experience.
Don't bother.
I'm a long time Pokemon fan but these games, which are the first main series games on a actual home console rather than portable are NOT worth $60 at launch. Having less than half of all Pokemon to catch is just a minor issue compared to the bad graphics and glitchiness of the games. And also do NOT get the download version because it can cause you to lose your SD card data because the game is very very glitchy. The games do not look much better than the older 3DS games and the online support is basically a pay wall. You have to pay money to play the games with other people online. There are Pokemon characters who are NOT coded into the game at all. You can't bring old legendary Pokemon from other games because their data doesn't exist in the games. So if you have a shiny Latias that you caught in Pokemon Go for example, you can't bring it to the new games. The starter Pokemon are shiny locked so if you are a shiny hunter you can't reset to get them shiny. You also cannot get about 400 or so other Pokemon because they are not coded into these games. In the 3DS games you could get 807 or something like that as of Ultra Sun and Moon. In these Switch games it's just over 400. These games cost $20 more than the 3DS games yet you don't get as much content. I regret buying Sword. I listened to good reviews from the game sites like IGN and gave the games a chance. And I totally regret it. I already have the game beat even though it is supposed to be a 40 hour game I had it beat in 14 1/2 hours. The game is just bad. Edit: there are free updates and paid expansions that add more Pok?mon both new and old. The games are getting slightly better but a companion app called Pok?mon Home is needed to do transfers and adds some missing features back like GTS but it costs a chunk of change ($16 yearly subscription) to actually get any use out of it (it’s freemium with only enough free storage for 30 Mons). It’s been improved but it’s still not quite worth it. I will say it went from a 1 star to 2 and a half stars.
A Masterpiece of Modern Art
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece of modern art. It transcends the barriers of our mere mortal understanding and ascends to a new plane of reality beyond that which we puny humans are even capable of comprehending. It has touched my heart forever, and I am a deeply changed man. I give Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales a perfect score of 100/100, and graciously declare it to be winner of the 2000-3000 Millennium Award. Truly, humanity has finally reached its ultimate evolutionary form.
This game isn't violent
A Great game but not for kids!
Amazing
The reviews for this game compares it to gta, this game has almost no violence. The blood is almost none, the only concern is the story being a bout the mafia. My kid was begging me to let him play it so I sat down and watched some gameplay and then decided it shouldn't be R at all. It should be M. After my sun played it he said it was really good and he enjoyed it and is waiting for the next game to come out now!
The game is set in 80s Japan during the bubble economy - which means that the backdrop is a time of sex, booze and gangsters. Which should be enough to keep kids away from the title. The story is great, it is about a young guy who is framed for murder and is trying to find his way in the world of the Yakuza, big buisness and trying to figure out what like is about. The game actually has two MCs, the other one is a Yakuza who has fallen from grace and is trying to get back into the game. Both MCs are pretty moral (as in they don't want to kill anyone and try their best to be as good as they can be). All in all one of my fave games but not one I will ever let my kids play (until they are old enough) especially with the VERY stark sexual themes (which are in a lot of mini games and impact the main story).
While this could be one of the best of the Yakuza games, it full of violence and swearing, the fights are mostly tame however the heat action moves could range from enemies having their heads pushed into wall or being crushed by bicycles. There is also one or two torture scenes, one in a flashback, mostly obscured but the second is far more graphic. The story is also mature and at times very emotional. Best left to the adults but still one of the best titles on PS4.
Japanese version of zero series is NOT for kids.
Many people don't know but the japanese versions of some zero games are very violent, if you switch your game version to japanese of a zero series not the zx, there is a lot amount of gore. The robots even splatter blood so only adults or teens will play the japanese version if they like blood and the story also has a pretty dark tone too. The english version is very fine though. It is a really good hack'n'slash game like devil may cry but it is 2d, you can eliminate enemies like a super cool assassin robot.

Awesome tool for making whatever your imagination wonders too!!
back to full review
Dreams is a great engine to create whatever your heart desires in any way, but you can also play the things that other people make. And that’s when it gets slightly inappropriate. Here is a parent review sorted into 5 sections: VIOLENCE: Violence is limited, and if it gets over the top moderators can remove the creation from the browser. This violence can range from mild-moderate fight scenes, violence such as shooting with blood sprays and splatters, dead bodies and mutilated corpses with innards hanging out rarely. Inside games, you can also explore dark and disturbing content of any kind, with an exception of rape and sexual harassment. LANGUAGE: Language is infrequent and hard to find in general, but you may hear some usage of “shit”, “damn”, “hell” and “ass” along with all of its variations. Sometimes, you may find a “fuck” or two that snuck under the moderators DRUG/ALCOHOL/TOBACCO USE: In games, characters can smoke, show and do drugs etc. without any restrictions. SEXUAL CONTENT: This is restricted in every way, and you will never see any of this as well as nudity isn’t present. OVERALL: 12-16+
Staple suggestive themes and bare bones delivery mire a once 'must have' franchise.
Parent of 2
Better then mortal combat! (Though that game is really good)
For parents, read the Common Sense review as I won't reiterate the same points. As far as replayable content and controls, this is another fine rendition of very responsive and quick controls. Unfortunately, with the most bare bones delivery set in comic book form and the cutback of a huge part of it's roster with only a handful of new fighters, this is perhaps the most disappointing Street Fighter game to date. Although this title knows very little rivalry in quality, even in it's worst renditions, this was considered a step back and a letdown to most fans of the franchise. Also, after the crossover Street Fighter X Tekken game with it's 2 on 2 features and massive roster, this game conveys a comparatively minimalistic feel with a huge missing lineup of characters and modes found in previous games. Being a Playstation exclusive should not entice one to buy a PS4 console as SF4 and X Tekken were superior games despite the fact they are not as High Defintion, but they both more than make up for this in sheer content and replayability.
This game is definitely a great fighting game. Beginners can 'button mash' to victory, whereas more experienced players (like me) can string together advanced combos to win. A must-have for any gamer over 10.
A all around fun game me and my 12 year old love this game! But sadly when ever we VS he usually beats me ):
Good kids game
It's not inappropriate it is really good for kids/adults who like mario and or sonic
Honestly a Really Fun Game
Sexualalized dancing
Tamer then Just Dance 2018, but still questionable in places.
Inappropriate Choreography and Negative Lyrics
Great for all ages to stay active in the cold!
Great!
In my personal opinion, I find this game to be extremely fun and a convenient way to get exercise. Catchy songs, fun dance steps, etc. However, I have been reading other parent reviews that have been stating that this game is "oversexualized." I really just wanted to point out that if there is a movement or dance step that you really aren't comfortable with doing, there's nothing stopping you from simply skipping that step. The only thing that will happen will be a slight decrease in points. But overall I really love Just Dance and will continue to play their games in the future!
Many of the dances that the women do are very saductive and sexual. The songs are inappropriate. I do not think girls of any age should be dancing like this.
Just Dance bumps back up to the E10+ for this game (last year's game was rated as the regular old E), and normally stays comfortably within the boundaries of that rating. Most 'inappropriate' lyrics (profanity, sexual content, drugs/alcohol, etc) are blanked out entirely. However, there are still a few songs that parents may want to skip over: "bad guy" by Billie Eilish contains the lyrics "Make your girlfriend mad type/Might seduce your dad type" and "I like it when you take control/Even if you know that you don't/Own me, I'll let you play the role/I'll be your animal." "God is a woman" by Ariana Grande contains numerous sexual allusions and is probably the most sexually forward song in the game; "You love it how I move you/You love it how I touch you", "I'm telling you the way I like it, how I want it", "Baby, lay me down and let's pray". A "Kids Mode" is available for very young players, free of any objectionable content.
Big fun for way older teens who want to learn some of the latest dance moves. Unfortunately, a song by BLACKPINK featured choreography completely inappropriate for younger girls. Parents could easily skip over the suggestive choreography and ignore negative lyrics, but it’s unlikely kids of any age will follow suit as they’re accumulating points and learning by repetition. After noticing other sites rated Dance 2019 for younger kids than Dance 2020, we’ll be trying that out instead. I’m not a strict parent, but it would be great to see this game redesigned so that all levels can be enjoyed by anyone in the family,; especially considering kids generally are able to bypass parental settings.
Kids in our house of all ages love it. We have six kids ages 2 to 11. The younger kids play the kid version the older kids like the regular version. The regular version does have some mild swearing and sexuality. But like I said just put the kids on the kids version and they still love it!
It has great music! Yes the unlimited is worth buying. Great way to exercise! The game sometimes doesn’t censor words but there is a kid version so that’s why I said 5 and up.
