It’s not as bad as you think it’s got a tiny bit of violence and language and that’s about it
Yes it has a tiny bit of violent but coming from someone who isn’t a horror expert I find it not scary whatsoever . There is no reason your kid shouldn’t play this game . To be clearly honest it has a tiny bit of language but it isn’t extreme. In addition to that at middle school everyone is swearing so it’s no different to when they are at school.
Fantastic game overall
oh my god this game is so great
As a 19 year old with a little sister. I've come to expect that each time I get a new game she will want to play it alongside me, and Risk of Rain 2 is no different. First of all, this game does have teamwork involved whenever your playing in multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, there is only online multiplayer available to the PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game, and Online and Local multiplayer on Switch. Each version has a chatbox for players to talk to each other through, and on PC/PS4/Xbox One there is also the party system that players may elect to use. I personally play on Switch, so if I choose to speak to teammates I use Discord (Nintendo really needs to learn how to do online, but that's not why I'm here, is it?) Second: violence. How violent is this game really? Not really. This game could actually pass with an E10+ rating just like the original if the ESRB didnt take offense to the presence of blood (which very rarely even shows itself.) Language: very mild, very minimal. Something that someone 7 and up could handle, no f-bombs. Lore still isn't fully written for all of the items. Is it educational? Outside of multiplayer, it's not. I dont necessarily like educational games to begin with (I didnt like them as a kid either, they where boring and I'd only play them once for about 5 minutes before booting up TF2) so I'd understand if you dont get it because it isnt educational. But I will say this, this is a really fun game if rougelikes and 3rd person shooters are your thing!!
its fast paced rouge like the original is better though
Good game for teens
This game is good for teens. You start as an ape, the goal of this game is to evolve and become a modern human. The game starts in the jungles of Africa 10 million years ago. You have a clan and you can lead them, also you have to gather materials, resources, and food to survive. There are predators and animals that you have to watch out for in the jungles.
action/anime movie lacks everything
i played this game and man did it suck to the last play. anime, i expected, was to be better not all comic-fashion mockery! i disliked almost even the comic-mockery-action-typho thingyamijig.
Sleeper hit of the year
Very mild violence for a shooter. Fantasy combat with a fantastical gun where blood looks like smoke. "Body explosions" dont cause any gore; its almost literally fairy dust. The worst you'll see is periodical very bloody bodies. Infrequent strong language. ** This game just sticks and grows on you the more you play and think about it. One might notice the exploitable and seemingly shallow combat that is not painfully challenging. But look longer and you will discover superb level design, wonderfully contructed mayhem and the sense of superpowered fun that is unparalleled in its genre. One may be disappointed with the plot and its unclear conclusion and one-note protagonist; but the more time you take to analyze the game world, its subtext and intricate and purposeful decoration; soak in the haunting and uncanny atmosphere complemented by a surprisingly quirky sense of humor; search and read for every lovingly placed and written collectible and multimedia you will find a rich world that isn't dependant on traditional story conventions. Also NO FORCED WALKING or walls of boring text (Eat it Quantum Break!). Remedy's best if you ask me.
Severe difficulty spikes may discourage casual players.
As you progress through the beginning of the first world the balance and challenge seem fair and rewards skill. However, very soon you are dropped into tight corridors and can be quickly overrun with hordes of enemies. The "dodge roll" is your only real evasive maneuver that you literally HAVE TO master for each enemy. There is a slowness and weight to your character that you cannot simply outrun enemies for long and you will be required to "Get Good" at this one go-to move. The game rubber bands difficulty (to a degree) so that new players can play with higher levels, but you will still be very squishy and weak in comparison much of the time. So, if you are big into the Dark Souls level of difficult and lumbering gameplay, you will feel right at home with this title. But more casual player should NOT mistake this for another shooter like Gears or Division as you will most likely die several times over before defeating many of the areas and especially multiple times on the majority of the boss fights. Also, if you are totally new to this difficulty "genre" of other such titles, you may be frustrated and tempted to quit very early on. I played with higher level friends for the first week, but after a fresh attempt on solo. I quickly realized how much I was dependant on better players, but as a solo player or with Randies (random players) this game can be brutally difficult. Not sure if I would have bought it and invested the time had I known some of this sooner. NOW, the good is that most of the bosses are interesting and there are a couple dozen different enemies as this game does not skimp on enemy types which keeps it fresh. The weapons are well done and feel good with fair hits and some interesting powerful weapons. You can also gain armor sets, each with unique and stackable perks and mods for your weapons (AKA Turret or minion summons, healing rifts and hive swarms). Much of the aquiring of these may have you looking up you tube videos as several of the puzzles for attaining the best gear are not obvious. It's a well done game with some memorable boss fights, but it can truly kick your butt throughout, and seemingly designed to do so..
Just another BR disguised as something else
perfect game
The best game
Was hoping to find something fresh and different from the overdone mayhem that is the battle royale genre. But alas, it's just one more in disguise. They lure you in with the promise of PvE and the occasional (even hinting at optional) PvP but my oh my, how well deceived you will be - I certainly was. The scenery is quite good looking. The map is pretty much the same, with dynamically changing objectives. And the mobs have interesting mechanics to keep you constantly moving and aware. But that's it. The lack of depth in the quests is disappointing. You can craft weapons, only to have to buy them ingame, with credits... And the match making is laughable. if you're looking for a somewhat entertaining FPS with quests in between, this might be for you. Otherwise, your time is better spent gaming on something else.
it has good graphics its smooth .There are many things you can do .
I know that it says it is 13 and up but it is not really
Sophisticated and great-looking turn-based strategy game
If you're looking for a simple game, or an action game, this one is not for you. This is one of the most sophisticated turn-based strategy games. It has a strategic level map and then a drop into tactical battle map. The graphics are great. There is much to learn. Mastering this game exercises your cognitive skills! I believe no one could say this game was 'mindless entertainment' that was a waste of time. If you believe games can be great learning and skill development exercises, this one is for you.
Just another generic walking+jump scare (TM) game
You walk around a drab house for 2 hours with mediocre/easy "puzzles", predictable jump scares, and occassionally run and hide from scripted monster attacks all while a dull story with poor voice acting plays out. No inappropriate content save for a (child's?) severed head covered with maggots in one scene.
GOOD GAME
Worth the buy if you have extra cash
The best game in America
i think 9 plus is outrageous for this game you play football my son plays this all the time the only bad part is multi player because some people curse it is a good game and family friendly.
Good game but could use mild improvements in gameplay style.
It is so much fun it does not have bad stuff in it
This was boring as hell
Pretty shovelware. Playing a Mech-dog doesnt come close to fully armed boots on ground action. Every level is the same boring euro city block or boring interior. Enemy and weapon variety is hardly existant and there are almost no gory kills. Not even the primary flamethrower causes any burn damage. The hacker interludes are boring palete cleansers for an already bland main course. Stick to Doom VFR which has way more of everything.
Good game for mature teens and tweens
What a waste.
The game has great messages it does have guns but manny games for 6 and above have guns there is a small amount of swear you would see in a pg13 movie also there are bars no sex
Awful progression with unnecessary RPG elements that severely dampen the gunplay, bad and boring level design, poor netcode, Bethesda's signature buggyness, and top it off with the most obnoxious and unlikable characters in a video game since Duke Nukem Forever. The only good thing is the introduction of a multiverse which gives hope of another reboot that could fix the catastrophe this series has become. Super gory as usual.
Excellent game. One of my favorites!
Awesome!
Great Strategic Game!
This is an excellent game that requires critical thinking and planning. My biggest complaint is that the "effectiveness" of the teacher/instructor you play in the game is based almost solely on how much you pander to what students want to hear. The students are older teenagers (then, later in the game in their early 20s) so there is a fair amount of mild flirting and references to some of the characters being promiscuous and one of the adults drinking too much. For the most part, the game's violence is pretty tame. Characters are seen using weapons against enemies, but the gore is very low. The exception are a few of the key cut-scenes which are pretty gratuitous and visceral. Because of the strategic leveling up of characters/units, I would find it surprising if players under the age of 13 could finish this game. I would also mention that none of the paths through this game are unproblematic; they all require being complicit to some degree with what may be seen as poor ethical judgement for "the greater good."
Awesome strategy game, good for most ages!
Great game, needs strategic mind to win, one of the better fire emblem games!
Rated 15 (strong violence, threat, language, bloody images, suicide references, sexual threat, horror, drug misuse).
I know a lot of people have already said this but if you child knows about the game it’s probably ok
I know another review said this
If they are old enough to know about it there old enough to play it
A bit of violence
No worse than a typical DC/Marvel superhero movie
Don't let kids under 18+ play this.
1 out of 5 it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
An EXPERIENCE filled with tears and jeers.
not for kids.
Beyond Two Souls
SEX/NUDITY - There is some sensuality and passionate kissing in one scene, where two characters make out on a bed (no nudity). One scene gives the player the opportunity to go into a back alley with a man to perform sex, in order to get money for food; she gets on her knees, implying she would perform oral sex, however she refuses anyway before anything can actually take place. In refusing, the man gets annoyed and demands that she is going to "take it", otherwise threatening that he will "get real mad". Before anything else can happen, her linked supernatural being intervenes by strangling the man, and the main character escapes. There is some very mild nudity in a couple of shower scenes, although it is in no way sexualised nor explicit in its portrayal, mainly showing bare backs. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are sequences of strong violence throughout the gameplay and cutscenes. While much of the violence is more action-orientated (hand-to-hand combat scenes, action set pieces) and has less emphasis on the strength of the violence, there are some stronger moments where the violence is more disturbing and shocking, or has bigger emphasis on the infliction of pain and injury. An example of these stronger moments include a torture scene, where a character is cut with a knife on the arm, and it is heavily implied his eye is gouged out with a knife. While lacking in explicit detail or gory visuals, there is still some sight of blood and the whole scene is very intense. Another example is when your linked entity possesses a soldier to commit a mass shooting on a group of government officials in a foreign country: there is more emphasis on bloody impact detail than other moments of violence. Furthermore, another example is when a group of homeless people (one of whom is the main character) are threatened and attacked by a gang of thugs wielding baseball bats, and the leading member knocks out the main character. He also hits her again while she is incapacitated, and a pool of blood can be seen around her head. Other moments of strong violence include shootings and stabbings with limited bloody detail. There are also sequences of supernatural violence when beings from another realm torment the main character. PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck"), and milder terms used throughout. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There is some drug misuse when players have the opportunity to smoke marijuana at a party, which causes the character to feel light headed. There is also sight of alcohol consumption, and one character is mildly depicted as an alcoholic. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent scenes of strong threat throughout, including some psychological threat and supernatural horror. There is also an element of sadistic threat in the interrogation scene. The entire game is very suspenseful, and also emotionally intense, and contains some mature themes. In addition, there are some points where the player can attempt suicide, such as the character finding a knife and beginning to cut her wrists (brief bloody detail) before being stopped, as well as attempting to jump off a bride into a busy road where she is again stopped before anything can occur. The theme of suicide is briefly touched upon in some scenes. 15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.
Normal violence
As another reviewer says if they already now about it should be fine. If your child is ok when it comes to violence it’s a great game!
Same old teen drama stuff, if you’re kid knows about I think they are fine playing it to be honest
Quite a bit of violence but not inappropriate
There is very occassional use of strong language, and a couple of sex scenes with very limited nudity. Other than that, this is basically very similar to a superhero movie or TV show. It touches on some difficult themes and issues such as bullying, homelessness, and CIA's covert military operations, which your kids may not understand or even pick up on. But it certainly isn't unsuitable for them to play it.
You should never let your kids under 18+ play this rated M (Mature) for 17 and up like me. I can play it because I'm a adult. 21 years of age. So, I admit in you not allowing your kids that are under the age of 21 and up. Beyond Two Souls does have cussing in like fu** and Sh** and bit**.
As an experience, Beyond: Two Souls is an intense and dramatic ride where you will laugh, cry, and mostly cry. But as a game, the challenge falls short- wait a second, that's right, there is none. Seriously, I'm pretty sure you can't die or fail at all in the game, even when you mess up the button prompts. It's not to say that Beyond is bad, it just shouldn't be considered a game. If you are a parent planing on buying the game for their child, here are some things you should know. And if you're anyone wanting to buy the game for yourself, stop reading and read another review because there are some major spoilers here. First, there are some very mature themes in this game, including, but not limited to child molestation, underage drinking, corrupted military officials, suicide, a mother having to give away her child, and of course, lots and lots of violence. It should be noted however that the player usually has a choice on how they can go about these situations. Although most bad situations inevitably happen anyway, the player still has some choice in the actions the protagonist takes. For example, in one scene the protagonist is at a party, and birthday girl offers you some beer. You have to option whether or not to actually drink it. As for sex, it really isn't anything you wouldn't see from a PG-13 movie. Jodie (the protagonist) gets naked a few times, but her breasts, butt, and private parts are never exposed. You have an option if you want to have sex or not, including a comment where Jodie says "We still have time before I have to go." to one of her possible love interests, but the sex itself is always cut out. There is also a scene where Jodie gets molested by three older men in her teens, but Aiden, the entity that is bound to her, kills them before they can do anything too graphic. Harsh language is also very frequent, especially from the main character, and can't be turned off. There is blood where it is necessary, and it also can't be turned off. The game (or whatever it's called) has a positive message at the end saying that loved ones will always be with you, even after they have passed. That being said, the game is also very depressing since nothing ever seems to go Jodie's way, and she can be seen frequently crying. This may not be a good idea if your teen is going through depression, because it might make them feel worse.
beyond two souls is an average game based on the similar game that David cage made heavy rain stars with two familiar actors Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe but parents due to the mature themes beyond two souls is not for kids this game is only for adults and parents you need to know that beyond two souls has some intense violence many in which Players can punch and kick human enemies, choke them and break their necks, and use guns and knives to kill soldiers. Blood appears around wounds. Assuming the role of a ghost, players can possess enemies and make them kill themselves. There are also scenes of torture, and one scenario depicts a trio of men attacking a young woman in a failed attempt to rape her although there is no sex or nudity there is Another scene shows a character propositioning fellatio, and yet another has the player's character actively delivering a baby only side angles with bare thighs are shown there is constant strong language used and there is smoking and drinking used such as beer and marijuana.
This Game Is amazing, But dissapointing, compared to i would give the game 6.5 their is one sex scene which is two people kissing, and a woman having a baby. The game is emotional but has many flaws. check out the ign review of beyond two souls, it will give you more information, but i wont let my chilldren play this
