Memories
Loved playing these back on the Sega Genesis and still love playing them now. The memories from these games are just great.
I love that hotel owners design
Fun solving puzzles and even provided a couple challenges for Daughter and Daddy
Charm Oozes Out of Nintendo's "Horror" series
That hotel owner is beautiful. All I can think of. She takes my breath away, every time I see her pixels on screen. Highly recommend it.
I bought this "for me" as a late Christmas gift. I play Mario Kart and Mario Party with my daughter (we'll call her Princess Peach), and Dad needs something fresh. I had seen the gameplay for Luigi's Mansion 3 and noticed you could play it with two players on story mode. I've been playing games my whole life and naturally wanted to get Peach into them. So knowing Peach's level of critical thinking, I thought she might do well to challenge herself and learn a game that didn't drive for her (i.e. mario kart drive assist). Peach will be 5 in July 2020. Peach has got a pretty good grip on most the controls. You'll be using both thumbs, the left to move Luigi around and the right to aim the Poltergust (vaccuum) or flashlight. She moves around just fine, can open doors and interact with objects. There was a learning curve that I had to walk her through, but it didn't take her long to pick up on it at all. She sometimes struggles with aiming the Poltergust and getting the ghosts (which can get tougher the further up the mansion you go). Still, we were able to beat the entire game, but there were times I had to take on Luigi so we didn't die. I tried to have her use Gooigi who can die and come back to life as many times as you want. One note on Co-Op: You will be unable to play the story on co-op until you get through a "tutorial" portion at the beginning of the game - once you get the poltergust and defeat the bellhop ghost in the garage, you'll have to get a briefcase which gives you access to Gooigi and finally a &lt;5 minute tutorial on how to use him. Then you can turn on Co-Op through the pause menu. We needed a little help from youtube on some of the bosses/puzzles where I was just missing something to solve. Some of the later bosses were actually kind of tough. But we were able to talk to one another, explore together and solve puzzles together. You're able ot buy gold bones which revive you if Luigi dies, and we were never really at any point where we were in danger of getting the game over screen once they were available for purchase (got to beat few levels first). Mom or Dad don't have to be gaming professionals, but you will be doing most of the ghost encounters on your own until the little one picks up on it (early on, I had to take out 100% of ghosts, but even now, it's 90%/10% at best) and you will have to do most of the directing and prompting to get your 4-6 year old to solve puzzles. You'll also want to consider taking over Luigi on boss fights if your little one is unconcerned for Luigi's well being. But the game starts out easy and gets progressively harder, so you have time to get acquainted with the controls if you are generally new to gaming. But it was great fun and I'm so glad I bought this game. So much so, that Peach has asked that we play through the whole game a second time. I give this a 5 star because it is the perfect fit for what I was looking for - a game that challenges my daughter to think about how to solve the puzzle at hand, introduce her to the next step in coordinating both thumbs to move and aim concurrently, and it's super fun, silly and cute. It's not going to be that challenging for the experienced gamer, but Dad is happy sincec Peach is always asking me to play it with her and spending time with her is why I Luigi's Mansion 3 in the first place.
To get an idea of how charmed I was during my delightful play through all you have to look at is one moment. There is a moment where a ghost nearly drowns Luigi and Luigi is saved by Polterpup. Luigi takes a moment to pet him and tell him how much of a good puppy he is.
A waste of money
Best Indonesia's fantasy game
Nice Game with good Giveaway
I say it’s 18 plus because it’s near impossible to play. Unless you are a wizard. The graphics are gorgeous it’s why I bought the game. But it’s controls are laggy, there are so many enemies and you take almost half a bar with every hit. On top of that you can’t heal. Not easily at least. I’ve played it for 2 hours and made it maybe 3 minutes in the game because it’s impossible not to die.
I learn about mythologies of Indonesia in this game.. Interesting story and suitable for all ages. You can learn many Indonesian mythologies that have never been known before..
I bought this game last week and got nice giveaway with special Soundtrack CD The art is beautifull and easy to play, the character is cute and lovely. The map is great and easy to understand. Nice game to collect. Love it !
The Lord's name is taken in vain.
Surprising bite.
One of the characters uses "For Christ's sake" in dialogue.
It may seem slow and miserable after its surprisingly fast paced intro which leads you to think this is some sort of hack and slash; but if you give it a chance and stick with it, you will find a game with strong atmosphere, innovative and intuitive role playing/progression mechanics and a story with (mostly) better writing than Life is Strange. Combat isnt super deep or challenging but is one of the more fluid takes on the Souls formula. Theres also a large amount of blood and gore in combat (gushing blood, impaling and exploding foes) and throughout the world with mountains of gross rotting and scorched corpses. Especially in Skal lairs with disemboweled and impaled nude bodies. Moreso if you choose to lead areas into chaos with your choices. Fair amount of F words.
Not the best
This game is fun but only for a short amount of time. This game gets boring easily. I played this a lot when I was growing up though. Basically there is a monkey in a ball that has to pass the finish line as quick as possible, but while you’re at it you also have to collect as many bananas as possible for extra points. I recommend to users that like cartoon challenge/racing. — What’s in the game? Cartoon Violence - Players spend most of their time racing through tracks, but there are boss battles that pit players against large enemies. Combat generally involves dodging enemy attacks while charging up and rolling your ball into them.
This review is BS
Incorrect
Great
Great
CSM wrong AGAIN!!!
READ THIS BEFORE NOT LETTING YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME
Don't bother going through a history class on modern war just pick up this game
Totally fine for kids.
Grand game
This game is amazing and definitely NOT 18+
Uncreative
Use common sense
Not 18+
information for parents
Great game
Hard hitting but brilliant campaign, great multiplayer
Really great game and not that violent
Another good cod game
Helicopter
Great game, but very violent and brutal.
Ok. I'm reading this review and I think these people went way overboard with their review. First, kids need to know about this stuff in the world. Second, this only refers to the campaign, as in multiplayer, you can barely see the blood. In the campaign, there are maybe a few bad scenes, but you can turn Gore and Dismemberment off in the settings. These people are crazy, and I think they need to play multiplayer, too
Firstly you know this is wrong when it says it has no role model value because it does. The video even said it itself when there are police and armed forces protecting country’s from terrorist threats. Surely armed forces hold some kind of role model value. This game in multiplayer mode is really not that bad and only a little cloud of blood when you kill someone. The language I admit is quite bad but it depends if you think your kid is mature enough. Multiplayer is not bad at all and campaign swears a little bit. I hope this review can help you decide on what you want to do.
I don’t get people are saying this game is bad.
Definetly 13+
I have 2 children aged 11 and 12 asking for the new call of duty despite knowing this game was fairly brutal I decided to look into the game after seeing CSM review It was a definite NO. I later reviewed the parent comments and found out there were filters put in place to add a younger audience I suggest this game for your children aged 11+ (Some swearing but can easily be removed ) also great role models in the campaign. As long as your children are mature and doing well in school this game will be fine and maybe up knowledge in our would right now.
Call of duty Moden Warfare 2019 is rated M in America and MA in any other part of the world and I live in Australia so one day when my son came up to me and asked for this game I looked it up and saw that it was rated MA but then found out that you can turn of the blood, gore and swearing so it makes the game rated M and not MA. So I let my son get the game and I watched him play it for a bit and I made sure that he turned the blood and swearing off. And...... It really wasn’t that bad at all! The campaign is vey good because it teaches kids about war and history which in my opinion is great! Also the multiplayer has literally no blood at all! Even if you have the blood on there still won’t be any blood in the multiplayer! Also kids these days are very mature so they can very easily handle this. So if your kid is 11 or over and they ask to get this game, definitely say yes!
This game is so ok for 12+ not 18+ It is a great game because it teaches you about what is going on around the world in this type of war. It shows what people are risking to keep the world safe against terrorists.
I was reading other reviews that parents gave and they were way too serious. Like bruh 17 and up on the game case is BS first off. There are games TOTALLY rated M but they go Waay over board by saying “HECK” like wtf? But great for kids. Teaches about modern wars and is greatly dragged out in terms of the campaign, the general concept and playing aspects.
I am a mother of 3 boys 2 of whom are currently receiving second level education and I was always against them playing TOO much xbox and screens in general. My middle child who is now 13 and is starting to mature a bit asked me if he could get a game call call of duty modern warfare. He explained to me how the game works (bearing in mind I have never allowed him get Call Of Duty games before. I looked into it a bit and saw reviews mainly saying it is okay for teens 13 and up so I allowed him get it and he was very grateful for me allowing him to have it because a lot of children in his age group were playing it and talking about it and he wanted to join in their conversations. It may be worth noting that this is his first year in a new school and he was very anxious about fitting in. The game has 18 on the box but I did research and found out that provided you turn off blood and swearing that makes a game 16s so I deemed it acceptable for him to play. I sat with him once and I have to say he was having fun and it was not too bad when you put it in context. It actually taught him a lot about modern day war. So I think the game is fine for 13 and up.
i have been playing this game for a couple months and it is great. the campaign might be scary for younger kids but if your child is at least 11 and mature he should be fine. it has a little bit of scary images and torture but if you turn off the blood and gore it should be ok. The multiplayer is a lot of fun and lot like the old cod. Your child will have a great time playing this and connecting with friends.
The story is sure touching, but, in a way, completely uncreative as 99% of the original ideas and script were STOLEN from the real and original Modern warfare. The game should be sued for literaly stealing the name and proper title of its predecessors and the creators charged for copyrighting a predecessing title.
I think it's all subjective to the child. As a parent you have to decide whether or not your child is capable of understanding what's happening and emotionally able to distinguish between a video game and IRL.
Look, it’s teaching whoever plays about real life, well, modern warfare. It encourages and in fact tells you not to kill civilians, and also teaches to not be trigger happy. It may be a sensitive topic but children these days have experienced these things and parents shouldn’t pretend that their child isn’t ready and mature enough for it. Language, your child probably speaks like that normally to his friends by age 12. Blood, it’s only a slight mist, and it teaches the brutality of war and why it’s not good. There are outstanding role models, both female, and male. Race, gender, and other topics are all not discriminated and you play as several different ones. It is a great game and is just lazily grouped with other Call of Duty games.
I have been watching my son playing this game for the past week and a bit. Now as a parent I care a lot about my son and at first, I was hesitant to oblige to my son's pleas for me to purchase the game for him. I was also wary of the MA15+ rating but to overcome my queries and quell any questions of the true age limit. I decided to purchase the game and play it myself and soon came to discover that the game's campaign (story mode) is the more violent and darker part of the game but it also came out with some positives. one being that it shows great role models in the commanding officers also it shows how no gender or race prejudices as one of the highest-ranked officers and one of the few people that play a continuous roll throughout the game. the only concern that I had at the end was the slight mist of blood but that can easily be switched off in the settings before letting your child play. now the multiplayer aspect of the game to me has the one negative in the light mist of blood. other than that the multiplayer part of the game is a sandbox where your child can play with their friends try out a new thing and complete the everpresent challenges that keep you on your toes. another thing that makes the game a lot easier on your child is the skill-based matchmaking. Now, this is only active when your child is playing online. What it does is puts your child into the game with similarly skilled players I found this great as when my son was playing he wasn't outmatched but able to have an enjoyable time. the other parts of the game such as the multi
This game is brilliant however if you have a child 10 or under I would say avoid letting them play the campaign but the multiplayer is completely fine so is the spec ops. This game isn’t bad but the campaign can be a bit mature at times but it does have positive messages and I would definitely recommend this game to 11 year olds.
Most parents reviewing this wont have actually played the game but i have gone through the whole campaign and put hours into multiplayer. The campaign deals with heavy subjects including terrorist attacks in which civilians are gunned down/blown up. There are scenes of suicide bombers, stabbings, graphic gas attacks and obviously a lot of shooting. There is also a house storming mission in which gives the player the option to shoot unarmed people however this is meant to be avoided. None of this is glorified however and it really does show a realistic sense of modern warfare. The multiplayer is just your average call of duty game in terms of violence however and if your kid just wants this side of the game, i think it would be fine for anyone over 12. Overall the game is very violent and can be disturbing in places however it is a brilliant game that mature teens would be fine with.
This is a great game as i play it myself. The violence is probably the main cocern for people so i will cover that first. There is obviosly going to be violence because it is call of duty. The thing is, the fighting is always fast paced so most of the time you wont know whats going on. When you shoot an enemy there is a small bit of blood that comes out of them. The violence happens at long range so you wont be able to see it up close. There are also finisher moves but they are either just stabbing someone or shooting them. When you are shot your character grunts and your screen goes a bit red so you know you have been shot. ALL VIOLENCE CAN BE TURNED OFF. This means that your child wont see any blood or gore. There is in-frequent swearing using words such as the f and s words. Overall, with the blood and gore turned off, it would be sutible for all people age 14 and over.
Amazing. There is aload of swearing but it’s battlefield language, nothing worse to what children will hear in schools. The gore isn’t extreme but can be at times. 10/10 for ages 11+
This game is trash .They took out the helicopter in plunder.Took the fun away. When I bought this game it had helicopters. Now Ithe game is less valuable to me. I hate it and am erasing it from my PS4.
CSM definitely went a little overboard with their review. The game is violent and brutal, but it isn't terrible compared to other things. I think the violence is more in terms of context. For example, on one of the missions you are dealing with a terrorist attack on London, and you come across a man with a bomb vest strapped to his chest. The timer begins to run out, and there's really nothing you can do for him, so one of the other characters from the game pushes him off the edge of the building. You don't really see anything, you see him go off the edge, followed by an explosion. It's violent because of the fact that you couldn't save an innocent man who had children (he pleads for you to save him so that he can see his children). Overall, the game isn't very bloody, and if you want to you can turn all the blood and dismemberment off in the settings. I think more mature teens can handle this game, but it's definitely not for anyone under the age of 14. In terms of quality, it's a very great game with smooth controls and a fun and suspenseful campaign that I think anyone will enjoy.
