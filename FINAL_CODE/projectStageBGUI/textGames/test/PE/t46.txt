Not that violent but voice chat is main problem.
High quality amazing game for beginners and people who have friends in the FPS community
It's alright
Never gets repetitive!
It's okay!
This is easily one of the best FPS games out now. I play on PS4 but still a lot of people play. Some of the female characters are over sexualized. The game has positive messages said by characters and has a good lore behind it. But voice chat should be the main problem. I've been told to shut the f!ck up and people say sh!t and d!mn a lot. I don't care what people say personally. You also have the option to mute players before the match. Also you must have Playstation Plus or Xbox Live to play! There is no single player. Its a good game though and 10 year olds could play it but 12 year olds for voice chat.
I love this game and think it's awesome and a lot of fun. If you have a problem with chat just mute your TV and don't let your kids go on the chat. I would recommend playing this with friends as that really elevates the experience. The game isn't that violent but it can get frustrating. Some characters wear exposing outfits but all in all its pretty family friendly.
I think the game is very cartoon styled but is heavily borrowed off.of a game called TeamFortress2 but gameplay wise is nothing lIke TeamFortress2. The character selection is all broken down into groups offensive, defensive, tank, support. The characters are also known as (HEROES) characters have their special ability known as your (ULTIMATE) ability giving characters special advantages or assistance for your team. Heroes in the game by its self have difficulty rating certain characters take a lot of time to master and some are just plain easy to master and are what you should probably start with when first acquiring this game. Me I played this game.for a bit but I got bored of it and went back to Destiny I'm waiting for more content to start coming out. There are cosmetics and voice Lincecum and gestures that take much time to earn from lootboxes. LOOTBOXES can be purchased with real world currency but just lootboxes everything else has to be earned from playing.
This is a great game. I have played for hours on end, and it never gets boring. Many different gamemodes, a competitive ranked system, only downside is that other players often curse, but there is a chat filter.
Fun, cartoon styled gun blasting fun, characters are very like-able and have there own personality. P.s: There are cheaters in the game... so beware...
one of the best games ever A MUST GET EVEN AT FULL PRICE
Great, but raunchy.
The best game ever. Its okay for most 13 - 15 year olds
Great Fantasy Game
The Switcher 3
Amazing game, amazing story, it’s all you would ever want. But for kids it’s an ehhhh. People talk about how the nudity is the worst part but it’s only a small inconvenience compared to the rest. The game is dark and deep and kids at a younger age wouldn’t be able to appreciate and follow this game as more mature audiences would be able to comprehend what is going on. The game will briefly talk about rape, violence and wars. Then there’s the violence which can get very gory, but the only thing about that is if your kid can handle a lot of blood. Then there IS the nudity. You can engage in sex with Yen or Triss and both depict female breasts and don’t show the main act but show you as Geralt holding them closely. There is no Genitals but you can see a butt during the sex scenes, the only thing that may be good is that you can skip or say no to the sex scenes but I wouldn’t trust your young kid to be skipping those. It’s very iffy so if your kid is very mature than 15+ may be able to go down but if they aren’t. Wait on it.
First this is the best game I have ever played, and I have played quite a lot. As for when someone should play it?. I think it depends, I think its okay for any 14 - 15 year old and any mature 12 - 13 year old. The sex stuff is relatively minor and comes up rather infrequently unless you are looking for it. The finishers that are the most gore intensive part can be turned off. So swearing is the most prominent problem. for people that have read or watched game of thrones or the witcher this is fine.
Such a great fantasy game, okay for kids fifteen and up, lots of graphic sex, and very graphic violence, and tons of language.
Personally my child was interested in this game because his friends at school were playing it at the time I own a pc so I tried it out to see if it was appropriate for his age (13) it does touch on dark subjects and sexual violence at times but skips over it rather quickly and moves onto the main plot there is nudity but it’s only breasts and buttocks which is a normal part of the human body and they which they will see at some point in there live sooner or later, and sex is normal reproduction so don’t pull your kid away from a narrative masterpiece such as this, there is blood and your character does look at dead bodies often mangled into pieces by a monster but it’s nothing worse than Skyrim to be fully honest don’t let the R rating scare you it’s nothing worse than your MA RPG game.
Frostpunk is a very fun and well made city building game- but it's not for younger kids.
This game is very good! It is very fun and interesting, and will make you sweat as you try and keep your city of New London alive! The one thing I will say is this game is NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS! If you can't handle: extremely depressing scenarios, suicide, cannabilism, murder, mass death, and anxiety, this is not for you. One of the most bleak and cold games I have ever played. Sorry, but your little Minecrafters shouldn't be on this game.
The series I love is BACK!
This game can be really good for hand-eye coordination. I've played many different types of racing games. Such as Forza 5, and even Mario Kart. If you love to be competitive and want to work on your racing capabilities, then this would be a wonderful game to play. But I would say that it could be a bit violent at times. I suggest this game to people at and above the age 13 years old.
GRID has been absent for almost the entire PS4 and Xbox One era. Glad it came just in time. The races are back and better than ever. The score system in this game is literally get changing. The game uses vehicular violence more frequently than before. Some races start in an action packed slow mo, with either cars flipping or flying while you slide past them. Or you start the race with a gameplay cutscene where you've been pushed off the track and damaged a specific car part, drivers aren't seen hurt though.
The game is really fun
The game is really fun and you can do alot in it from what ive done and the first part of the game is really cool
emotional puzzle game might traumatize you if you aren't used to death
Amazing
It is an inspiring story of an astronaut launching into space to save earth from an energy crisis. There is no gore but I should note that there is some references to violence and in one of the rooms there is a hologram that shows one of the main characters being stabbed by a screwdriver. There is a body bag with a bloody handprint next to the part where she gets killed. But other than that it is a brilliant game that gives me chills just thinking about it. It is an emotional tale that if you a sensitive find a different game! (I recommend outer wilds). I loved it but it might not be suitable for children. I should mention there is a little language but nothing horrible.
Just a bit more scary than it seems from the traler

Beautiful, Fun Adventure
Trine 4 is a gorgeous game, I felt like I was stepping into some fantasy world, or some Harry Potter movie. The Nightmare Prince character could be frightening for young children, but it has about the same level of scariness as a typical disney movie. No mature content and great positive messages. I do suggest using easy mode to play the game and helping young children with some of the difficult parts as the game could get a little tough. All in all, Trine 4 is a great fantasy adventure!
Original and beautiful!
Concrete genie is amazing. I am someone who prefers games with action so I thought that this might be a boring game. I was wrong; very wrong. I found myself painting everything, spending more time than I should in areas just for my satisfaction. This is a very good game and you should check it out!
Scary, disturbing, but a good game
The game is a great mystery but there are parts that include jump scares and disturbing imagery. Fear of the dark is a big part of the scare factor.
Toast-Busters GO!
Why bother watching the movies this game is awesome
ghostbusters
It’s a great game
Who u gonna call
This game is ok
good game but it depends on the kid
The Ghostbusters Theme, back in your head
Amazing!!!!
Ok for tweens
THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome game!
good game for 9+
To sum it up, a down right good game!
Awesome game, Depends on Who Plays It
This Game Is...Fairly Awesome, I Have To Say
Sci-fi game perfect for 10 and up!
Amazing game! I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED the original one but this one is soooooo much better! A lot of violence though. No blood or gore.
This game is amazing!!!!! The game is way better then the movie!
i love it!! i play it every day.
It’s so good and it’s fun
this game i got for my ps3 and the graphics are good for a 2009 game. It has slme violent parts but its just hoovering up
This game is what you would expect it's a normal ghostbusters game. The story of this game is ok and is appropriate for younger people the multiplayer is kind of stupid though and should have never been added to the game overall the game was okay
when i was 7 i saw ghostbusters the movie and freaked out at the library scene so i did think that this game's library mission was going to be scary but the library ghost does pop out at you but is isint to bad it is the most scary mission as for the reat of the game the first mission is in the firehouse basement when slimer escapes you try and blast him but hit the storage unit couse you are a new rookie and slimer takes one of his freinds with him and you catch them mission #2 is the hotel slimer again!!!!! and at the end the game is 10/10 for me like i said ages 10 and up will like xbox 360/ps3 or ps2 ,8 and up wii/ds
I own the Wii version and its so much fun!!!! I absolutely don't believe in violence but the element where you could destroy anything using the blast stream is the reason I find the game so entertaining!!!! The only bad language (or mean language for that matter) is "knucklehead" which Peter said.
ok for tweens if your kid can handle 2 or 3 sware words.
It's pretty good. The last level is so dang hard!!! One level is pretty creepy, but I love the rest of the game.
I have the wii version.
this game is great for 3rd grade and up the ghosts might scare younger kids but the controls are pretty easy
Love this game, one of the best for the PS3 in my opinion and good for people who want to shoot the heck out of stuff without the extreme gore and violence. The only reason i put 12+ is because there were a few scenes were my siblings had their head buried in the pillow by fright! (Ages 8 and 9) The library scene is the worst but not too bad. I love this game! It is my all-time favorite. This game is a must have for any Ghostbusters fan!
I do not like this game. thats pretty much it. i stopped playing it after a frusturating boss battle, and either way, i don't like this game period.
I get easily scared, and scary in this game isn't a concern for me. But the game is kind of jumpy, what with ghosts and some infrequent surprise attacks. And some scenes (involving a woman who was a serial killer who drained her victims of blood) are very eerie and creepy. Anyway, I barely noticed cursing, until it was pointed out. The weapons aren't real, but they're still weapons, so that may raise slight concerns. But that aside, it's a great game with easy controls once you get used to them. And it's pretty fun. Take it from me, a die-hard Ghostbusters fan. &lt;3
Not that much cursing or violent but it is based on a movie. There is killing ghosts but not any other violent&#039;s it is easy to play.
Yeah, this game is flipping awesome. The language is a bit iffy, and really the only reason I put "iffy" instead of "on". The violence isn't too excessive, and only two or three sequences can be considered like, terrifying, though none scared me. I will admit to being slightly startled at some parts, but not too many. The controls are a bit hard to get used to (or maybe it's just me), but still, this game rocks my socks off! A+!
I love this game! It is my all-time favorite. I've rented it 17 times in a row once. This game ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
fun
Awesome
GEAT FOR EVERYONE
it is sometimes hard to figure out how to play it. but after all that, its a blast~
It is a must for Ghostbusters fans. It has some good scares like the spider witch but it is really fun no blood at all and minor language.
LOOK!!!!!!!!!!! THE NINTENDO AND PLASTATION 2 GAMES ARE DIFFRENT FROM THE PLASTATION 3 AND XBOX 360 THE XBOX 360 AND PLASTATION 3 SHOULD BE 8+ THE WII AND ALL OF THE OTHER ONES ARE 2+ IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GO WITH THE XBOX 360 ONE!!!!!!!!
