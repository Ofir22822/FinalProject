Great game to play even with younger kids
Brilliant !
Wish they wouldn’t have the ghost figures...
Terrific for Co-op Play with Parent
So far my favorite to play with my 3 year old. It's a unique puzzle platformer that requires you to work together, but it also has a helping mechanic where you can just pull up the other player up by tightening the yarn and having the other player pull himself up. Without that, it wouldn't be accessible until much later age. It didn't take long to get a hang of things and eventually we were able to tackle the harder puzzles. Your mileage may vary especially not knowing your toddler's experience with platformer genre/mechanics.
Great gameplay and graphics. I love the cooperation aspect of the game as it encourages teamwork. There are some scenes in the background with ghost like figures where kids are scared and running from bad guys. My 7yr old thinks they are zombies and says it’s a little scary. He’s also fine with Lord of the Rings movies so there is a certain creepy ness factor which is why I gave it an 8yr rating. I also wish that the yarn characters didn’t have “horns”. Again, the game play and graphics are awesome! Lastly, some scenes are calm and the next you might be chased by a large bird or fire amber so that could impact some children.
This game is terrific to play with your child! Frankly, the best I've seen so far! Whether its appropriate for you child depends on their gamer ability. My 6 3/4 year old boy has played video games for years. Mostly on the iPad but he is adept at Minecraft on the Xbox 360. In the past we had had failed attempts at the various Lego games. Though he mastered Lego Dimensions. I thought this side-scroller may be challenging for him but he took to it like a fish to water. We BOTH loved it. There are 7 primary levels in the game and the first 3 or 4 are pretty easy. After that the puzzles got quite challenging. But, he stuck with it. The game also allows my child's character to climb on my back and I take over for the two of us. This was useful in some of the challenging parts. But, surprisingly, I climbed on his back a few times for areas I found difficult and he was better at. One other thing I liked is that this game 'forces' the two of you to play together. Whenever we played video games in the past I always felt like the 'wing-man'. The support team. My son only ever cared about his achievements and what he did. This is the first time we really played together because it was important. He couldn't advance if I didn't and vice versa. So it forced him to work WITH me for the first time ever in a video game. As others have said, there is a 'background' story playing out in the background. My son always called them 'dreams'. Some of it seems like its a bit disturbing - a tween getting in to trouble or being chased etc. But, my son and I mostly ignored it. The background stuff does seem a bit creepy. I honestly didn't understand what was going on back there or the point of it. As I said, we mostly ignored it. The game is REALLY terrific. It's cute, fun, playful, beautiful and the single best time this father has had playing a video game with his son yet! I couldn't recommend it to a parent and any child 6 and above who is reasonably adept at using the controller and generally familiar with game playing mechanics.
Teens 12+
Not bad. Teens.
Its good but a lot of swearing and drugs
Not very much blood. Some frequent language that is used in game. If worried about cussing or bad language in game, I highly recommend turning off volume, as there are still indicators on screen that allows you to know what is happening in the game. No real drugs or achohol except for the green poison, which is used by the bad guys in the game to take over citizens. Barely any blood except for some bursts of blood when enemies are shot.
Small puffs of blood mist in combat. Some set pieces and aftermaths are bloodier/disturbing, but the game never gets gory. Frequent language. Its alot like Division 1 after its many updates plus some more tweaks, such as improved combat, level design, and multiplayer functionality. Loot is still kinda dry (this is Tom Clancy not Borderlands after all) but a strong sense of progression is there. The bosses are still lackluster but the journey is fun. I like the new setting better than before.
THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR KIDS THAT SAY THIS NOT A BAD GAME It was rated mature for a reason. There are dead bodies in a body bag everywhere in the city. I recommend you don't get your kid this game
Good game and it has no blood, which makes it good.
I don't allow my children to play games with blood, however they do play games with swords and weapons like this one. What I really like is that they play as someone that doesn't use any weapons, just his fruit which makes the character stretch. The game has no harm, and I played it before my kids did, and it is appropriate.
Just. Epic.
The game is so epic the word is even in the title. Just play it to see how epic it is!!!
Definitive hack & slash game still painfully immature.
Commonsense has no commonsense
Blood and Language
This just Rocks!
If you ever played Devil May Cry, you know what to exspect, just that THIS is the best version of itself. The gameplay, bosses and new character are great but the dialogue is dumb as usual, not to mention the mature themes that pop up and the sorely contrived CG action sequences straight out of a 12 year olds daydream. This series is the "best in class", just too bad they have to muck it up with cheap dialogue and facepalm storytelling . The new character V ends up being a very welcome new way to play that is both fresh and familiar at the same time. The REALLY nice touch is that ALL the buttons can be mapped to how YOU want them in case you find the default settings awkward or inefficient. I did this myself and it made the experience much more enjoyable. Over all thumbs up, but I think the plot needs some fresh content as the "reveal" here was underwhelming and way too familiar.
Fellow parents please read my review. I have heard of the devil may cry series before and decided to play the hd collection of the older games. THose games, I admit were pretty bloddy and had a lot of language. HOWEVER though, not this one. After my 13 yr old son Jeremy saw me play the hd collection of the older games he asked me if he could play them and I told him no, definetly not because of all of the gore and language. However, I told him I would be devil may cry 5 and see if it was any better content wise. IN FACT IT WAS! In this game there is some language, but it is infrequent use. There is violence of course, but the blood is minimal, and there is no gore. There is no sex like in the last games, there is no alcohol. and there is no drugs. I would rate this game for violence, blood, and infrequent use of strong language. This game honestly should have a teen rating and not a mature rating. It is equivalent to a pg-13 movie, and by giving it a mature rating it is like saying that this game is a r rated movie, and it is nowhere even close to that. If your pretten or teen is interested, PLEASE BUY THEM THIS GAME!
I think this is an amazing game, especially in the hack and slash genre. There is blood, but no gore. As a parent of a 14 and 13 year old I personally think that this game is fine for if you’re 13 or older. It can get bloody at times, but let’s be honest, when you’re playing video games, you don’t notice blood, your focusing on what to do next and on our enemy, so you don’t notice it while your playing. In the cut scenes on the other hand, do get pretty bloody, and the blood is pretty noticeable, when you’re watching the scene play out. You could always just skip the cutscene though. Language, there is some swearing, not to much, besides your kids probably hear swearing all the time at school anyways. You can also change the language that the characters are speaking to Japanese. So your child will not be hearing the actual words, but reading them instead. With all that said, I think it’s a great game, that everyone, and I mean everyone over the age of 13 should play.
Bloody fantasy violence for teens.
Could be better....
Very disappointing!
This game was very disappointing . The story line is boring, the amount of content isn't too much, overall not that great. Cleavage is shown but too much, and the violence is slightly raised from doa5. the DLC isn't all that cool (Mai was in doa5 so nothing new, and Kula is interesting but doesn't really fit that much in the game in my opnion). Then again the game is fan service and wasn't really made to be played very competitively. The costumes are very expensive, and the extra things that "offer a better experience" are way to much. doa5 was much, much better. I would only recommend the game to people who can spend lots of money and who are new to the series. Besides that the gameplay is similar to previous titles. However, there is a chance team ninja and Tecmo will release a remake of the game making it better like they did with doa5.
I see that no one has bothered to review this game yet, so I thought I'd add in my two cents. So let me just start off by saying that this game is a joke, a waste of time, energy and console space. I can't believe after all the content that DOA5 had, even in the base game, that this is all Team Ninja could come up with. This game is just insulting. I can't believe that the base game here is so pointless and wasteful. It's complete garbage that they make charge you almost $100 for a season pass, with season pass exclusives that are just pointless costumes, a bunch of other meaningless costumes with each pack very expensive themselves, and like, two third-party characters (Mai Shiranui and Kula Diamond), who don't even come with their own stage! Why not?! Smash does it! Tekken does it! Soul Calibur does it! I'm really amazed that CSM didn't give this 5 bubbles for Consumerism, because this game has a ridiculous amount of pointless of costumes with very few new characters and one new stage, with even more pointless costumes and another new character on the way so far, all that are very expensive. Now to get into the game itself, the only reason I gave this two stars is because of the graphical improvement and gameplay, other than that it pretty much sucks. Over half of the story mode is just Nico doing something in her lab or those two derpy schoolgirls Honoka and Marie Rose being annoying. Every other character barely has a story at all. Their new character Diego is just some retarded Jersey Shore guy who also annoys me. DOA Quest is very repetitive because they're all just rival battles. Jann Lee fighting Leifang again? Sure didn't see that coming! The stage selection is the worst part of this whole game. They're all just basic ideas and the most basic versions of those basic ideas. After a few battles you will get tired of seeing the same stages and stage hazards over and over and over. Do I really need to see someone get knocked down Jurassic Park again? Do I really need to see the Cracken knock someone through a ship and explode on bombs again? Do I honestly really need to see street fight thugs knock someone back into the fight again? It's just very annoying to see over and over! The new songs are complete garbage, making me have unlock all the old ones again. The regular unlockable costumes are a long grind to get and aren't even that good. This game has disappointed me so much. It hasn't even been out for a year and I'm already tired of every piece of content it has to offer. Just stick to DOA5, because this game is just sad and it sucks that Team Ninja thinks all of their fans are just idiots that will give them money no matter what.
Tremendously deep
Little objectionable content, but requires a great deal of patience
Like Civ V in space
Stellaris is a grand strategy game which offers a huge amount of replayability thanks to the almost endless empire customization options, and a myriad of random event and quests. It encourages and rewards analytical, long term thinking, since most of the time you have to make multiple decisions towards an objective well in advance, as you manage your empire and its resources, be those military, social, economic, et cetera. Intellectual, curious players will be ecstatic, since the game makes players ponder on issues such as social policies and its effects on diplomacy, deep space colonization, economic development, scientific progress, and more. To an inquisitive player, many of these aspects will pose immediate questions about how these things work, and what their consequences are in the real world. I definitely recommend it to be played by kids 12 and up, since it is very, VERY complex, and many of the concepts and their interrelations might not be fully understood by a younger player.
Stellaris is an excellent strategy game, where you create and play as a spacefaring civilization. You can explore the galaxy, settle new worlds, build an interstellar society, encounter other life forms, and possibly kill them. Stellaris has very little in the way of objectionable content, largely due to gameplay taking place on a literally galactic scale. Violence and warfare is a major (and unavoidable) feature, but even if you zoom in, all that is shown is starships fighting and exploding into debris. Sexual content and profanity are nonexistent (in single player). Drugs are very occasionally mentioned, but not shown. However, this game is also extremely complex. There is a tutorial to show new players the basic mechanics, but actually mastering the game requires a lot more time. Random elements can doom a playthrough in ways that may not be visible until several hours into a game. Younger children may not have enough patience, and are likely to be frustrated. That said, the simple beginning - a single star system and a few ships - makes this the easiest of the Paradox strategy games to get into. If your child is already familiar with other strategy games, particularly Civilization, they will probably be able to enjoy this one as well. If you are considering buying this game for yourself, you could probably involve younger children in designing your alien society. The game doesn't offer a particularly good or bad message. Your society could be a bastion of peace and democracy, or a bloodthirsty empire bent on galactic genocide. You could be devoted to your faith, or a ruthless criminal syndicate... or, in some cases, both. It should be noted that the game has a multiplayer component, with up to 32 possible players in a single game, and all the concerns that online multiplayer brings into any game.
Has great mechanics and a great premise, but has many of the same problems as Civ V where it just feels like something's missing, especially in the midgame, and its adoption of policy trees like Civ V is I'd say one of the greatest mistakes in its design. As well, whereas the civilization games have gone down a path of really ignoring atrocities, this game lets you do some messed up stuff to your populace (or fight those who do), which does help a little in flavor, but in the end, it's a lot of throwing balls of ships at each other while playing Star Trek brueaucracy sim.
