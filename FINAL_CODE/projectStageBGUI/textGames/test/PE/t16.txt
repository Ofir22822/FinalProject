Overall, not half bad. But it is on the edge for younger players.
this game looks age apropriate for 15 and above
Naked women statues littered throughout the game.
A fun zombie game, fine for mature 11 year olds
World war Z
Great Game
Its pretty much Left 4 Dead 3. Good for 40 bucks.
This is for the parents, typically we don't see games like this a lot, which means they're usually pretty bad, for example, DOOM. But in this case, this game is not that bad. For a younger viewer, it is pretty gory, but when parents see the big, bold, 18+ sign, its scary for parents. Let's face it, I think every M-17 game I've seen on this app is 18+ when it really shouldn't be. For example, for Halo 4, that game is not bad at all, it's about shooting aliens, and yes there is some blood but not much, and look, it's 18+. This game is pretty gory, but not the worst I've seen. I think it's not that bad, it's pretty good, when it comes to co-op, female breast on manikins are shown in shopping malls, but they are not graphic at all, thank you for reading.
Extremely disappointing. The game is LITTERED with nude statues of women, all women. The mall has naked mannequins, which aren't a bit void in form, but the second area has a museum where they get more detailed and much bigger naked breasts with nipples showing. The game is rated "nothing" or "non-existent" for sex, but if you have a young child playing this, he or she will see naked women. How is that not sex related? What's worse is you don't have to go looking for them, they're thrown around like bits of trash in your travel path, so you will run into them, constantly. The developer, sadly, has made sure you'll see them. Why? The game is pretty great without this aspect. It truly wasn't needed. I did not make it beyond the second part because I'm not interested in having this thrown in my everyday life.
This is a very fun zombie shooter, which is also appropriate for mature 11 year olds. The reason why i think this is because all the violence is (normally) very fast paced and unrealistic. Though there is a HUGE amount of gore, its quite undeatailed and players will be focosing more on the, other incomming zombies. As for language, its infrequent but strong, so expect to hear the F-word every now and then. Apart from the swearing and the violence, there is nothing else that would make this game inappropriate for kids and i highly reccomend it to zombie fans.
I’ve recently purchased this game and it was not worth the money I know most people like third person video games I have nothing against you that I love assassin‘s creed Tom Clancy‘s ghost recon days gone list can go on anon but we’re here to talk about world war Z for a zombie game that Aesthetically has the left for dead or feel to it messed with Warr aesthetically has the left for dead it feel to it But with that world war Z vibe aesthetically if it was more like left for dead with that first person perspective it would’ve been a whole lot better the game doesn’t handle real well when you AT but with that world war Z vibe aesthetically if it was more like left for dead with that first person perspective it would’ve been a whole lot better the game doesn’t handle real well when you ADS It’s real wonky I was just really disappointed I had high hopes but I was like damn that’s just my perspective on the game the graphics are good but third person gameplay for this style does not fit
Blood and Violence. It’s a really fun zombie game. The leveling system is great too! Within the campaign, there are female mannequins / sculptures with bare breasts and nipples.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney
Great Game. A tiny bit of adult content but overall teaches people about law.
It's okay
It seems cute. I thought it would be a bit more challenging. While taking turns on it with my little guy it seemed too easy. It might get harder and maybe I set it to the easiest difficulty settings. However, of the games we have, I don't see him playing this one much.
Good for people who love strategy
Is Assassins Creed 3 Remastered Violent?
Assassins Creed 111
This is awesome!!
This game is so good
Can turn off blood
Good game for mature kids
As a parent at first I wasn't enthusiastic about this game. Me and my son agreed that I would let him get the game as long as he would let me watch him and he would return it if it was too violent or inappropriate. I watched him and I found out of a feature on this game that Common Sense Media completely ignores. You can turn of blood for the whole game. I watched him play and without the blood the game is completely fine. If your child has seen any of the new Marvel movies and it didn't bother them then I would say he can get the game if they turn off blood because the violence without blood is exactly the same as those movies. If your child has seen those It movies the one the clown then they're definitely fine for this game with blood and without blood I guarantee it will be fine. The game isn't as bad as people have said. This game is truly fine for people even if they're mature 10 and up. Also it's a great less violent alternative to Odyssey which is the one that takes place in Greece.
I think you should not give every m game an 18+ my 11 year old child loves the game but never curses. It has a few rude words that you should never call something or ever say but my child handles the responsibility well.
I think the 18+ rating is way too overprotective and yeah it might have blood and some rude words but this game is THE BEST. It is a must play for 11 year and up. But there is drugs use but still if your kid is mature then go for it!!
My son really wanted this game and so I got it for him as a Christmas gift a while back last Christmas There is a option to turn off blood and there is no sex common sense why did you guys say that
I beat the game 10 times only saw one F word there is no sex at all i do not know why it says that on the disk the violence is fine because you can turn off blood
This games main issue is violence and if you child is "mature" enough for violence then the game shouldn't an issue. There is some swearing but not too much.
One of the most broken Nintendo Switch games I've played!
I have experienced a lot of gameplay glitches and crashes that I hope to see patched soon.
Not healthy or fun!
Not that violent
12+
11 and up
Teamwork and skill building
kids over 9 can play
It's ok for kids to play
Violent
This game is not good for any age child in my opinion . I see nothing positive about military sniper “ games” for children. My son is 14 and has woken up with nightmares after me stupidly letting him play this I hate to even call it a game . I’m very disappointed we have things like this out there that we are exposing our children too it’s sad that we can’t be more creative than shooting and killing
Not that violent Yes it's got guns but you aren't killing anyone just destroying robots and I think it's not as violent as killing people. I think kids over the age of 9 or 10 and up should be allowed to play this game. I hope that this helped other parents as myself decide if they should let their child play this game.
I watch my son play it and i think its fine. Not really like EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS, but more like a middle maturity level but it's not too bad.
No blood or gore compared to zombie games it can play multi player no sex it does say 1 swear word once after about playing like 5 hours of it no consumerism a little violence with te guns not to much though
Personally I think that it is a good game for children there is no killing people only robots and there are only a few blood print here and there .
Guns and creepy robots attacking you while you just shoot it with no real happy quality
Classic RPG That Is Recommended for Long-Time Fans and Newcomers
My favorite game of all time!
A lot more mature than you would think
Classic JRPG has aged fairly well and is ok for older tweens and up
Beware the Wall Market quest. XD
Parents need to know that this installment of Final Fantasy has a battle system that is easy to process for newcomers. The story is quite dark as the Main Protagonist's allies are killed off early in the game. Fair amount of strong language in the dialogue, such as damn, godd--n, sh--, and son of a b-tch, and plenty of insults coming from Barret. On the plus side, Cloud has a strong relationship with Tifa and Aeris, especially during the Wall Market chapter. - Spoiler Alert - Throughout the story, it's war between Avalanche and Shinra. Cloud was a former member of Soldier, but later joins Barret and crew at the beginning of the game. After the second boss fight, Cloud is separated from his friends, and later joins Aeris. Dec. 30, 2019 - I am playing the PlayStation Classic, and I had just defeated Reno.
I played this game many times as a teenager and even now it is unsurpassed in terms of gameplay, characters and storyline. The story is my favorite: a Swordsman mercenary leading a ragtag group of misfits against an evil corporation. Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockhart have since become my favorite VG heroes. On a parental note, there's some violence mostly mild with sporadic appearances of blood, some sex references, Tifa and Yuffie wear midriff baring outfits, One character smokes all the time, two times a bar can be entered and you can drink at one bar, and the language is limited to D***, H***, A**, P***, GD, and S***. Fortunately, all this is counteracted with plenty of great messages about heroism, loyalty among friends, respecting the environment, the dangers of capitalism, and diversity. All the characters are of different cultures and races such as several Caucasians, one African American, two Native American equivalents, two animals (though one is actually a robot), and one Asian. Even though the graphics are dated (except for the battle and cinematics), that's the only negative to this otherwise flawless and timeless game. It doesn't get any better than this.
I think it is funny how tame people think this game is. Due to its low quality graphics, it can pass as a teen game, but there is quite a bit of content that should push it to M. There is a brothel in this game with insinuated rape and nonconsensual interactions. Although most of this game is not characterized by overtly sexual content or violence, this is still in one part and the language is quite explicit in the original PlayStation version. In the Nintendo Switch version, they may have cut down on this though. I would recommend for above 14 year olds at least. It is overall a fantastic game though! Please play at the right age.
Violence: The majority of violence is relatively mild, consisting of turn-based combat with various weapons and magic, damage is indicated by flashes of light and defeated enemies merely dissapear. A handful of environments have bloodstains, including a sequence where you follow a trail of blood (retro graphics means it doesn't look particularly realistic). Some cutscenes have more moderate depictions of violence, including impalements and potentially upsetting character deaths. | Language: Almost entirely mild: damn, hell, *ss, crap, b*stard. Rare usage of moderate language, sh*t. All dialogue is through text, none is spoken | Sex: No sex scenes or nudity, a handful of characters have slightly revealing outfits. A town early on in the game contains a brothel, though this is heavily implied and many viewers may completely miss it. Occasional mild sexual innuendos. | Drugs: Some bars throughout the game, though alcohol is never seen or consumed
There's a fair amount of questionable stuff that's not mentioned here (even after it was toned down from the original Japanese). And I hope every kid knows that using those built in cheats (at least without doing at least one honest playthrough beforehand) is a matter of deep shame. At any rate, despite it's reputation, VII is far from the greatest Final Fantasy, but it's an industry and artistic milestone in many respects.
Great Game
Anyone mature over 14
Good Game, Know your kid
Won game of the year 2019!
Fromsoftware, you've done it again
This game is great! Violence is a large focus of the game so some amount of maturity is required but kids 13 and older should be fine maybe even younger for especially mature kids. If you are worried about the blood do not worry! you can completely turn it off in the options before the game even starts!
My son asked me for this game a while ago, and I wasn't sure about it because of the rating, and the fact that we have pretty high standards when it comes to ratings in media. However, the only thing to watch out for in this game is the violence and blood/gore, but the gore can be turned off in the settings, and there is no language or sexual themes. Really, if your kid is over 14 and is somewhat mature, they should be able to play it, it's not really going to be anything they won't see in PG-13 movies or TV shows
My son asked for this game for his 11th birthday, I was hesitant because the game was rated M. I read reviews and watched gameplay, and thought it was ok for my kid. There was blood present during the game, but it was minimal. I think the game is suitable for anyone who is remotely mature.
As much as this games a bit violent, it's not anymore violent from the standard movies your child probably watched anyway.
Sekiro is beautiful, somber, frustrating, thrilling, and the hardest game I've ever played by a long shot. Seriously, if anything is going to make you return this game (or, more likely, take it out of the console and snap it in half) it's going to be the difficulty. Now, I am not exactly masterful at video games, but I've surmounted every challenge fromsoft has sent my way so far, so I feel at least somewhat qualified to warn you about the difficulty. The game is unbelievably fast and intense, and demands instantaneous, skillful reactions from the player at an almost constant rate. There are methods of lightening the load, such as buffs and, most lethal, stealth, which allows the player to instantly kill most enemies, but even that can be tricky, and for mini-bosses who require two deathblows, after your stealth hit you're wholly on your own. It is a fair fight for the most part, but there are a few times, such as when you have to take on bosses or minibosses who summon hordes of enemies for you to fight as well, and those can be extremely frustrating, as there's no real skill you can employ to make it easier. In all other areas, however, Fromsoft remains top dog when it comes to things like atmospheric storytelling, incredible art direction and character design, awesome bosses, and just the absolute best music you'll ever hear in a video game. There's no cursing or nudity, and while there is blood remember that you can completely turn it off in the menu. At the end of the day Sekiro isn't perfect, but it's darn close. It has a surprisingly moving story about loyalty and honor, its visuals are breathtaking, and mastering its razor sharp combat is positively joyful. If you liked Bloodborne or the Souls games, Sekiro will not let you down, and if you haven't played any Fromsoftware titles, this is a great place to start, and you may even be better than the Soulsborne veterans without the muscle memory that they (and I) needed to unwrite in order to surmount this incredible, immensely challenging game.
