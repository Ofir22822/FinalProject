Bad
It's hands down the worse game ever. How do you say matchmaking is great when I'm getting into bronze games with diamond not to mention they can't stop nefting /buffing people is so annoying to see that your main does less damage every day or the dps heros lazer you if you don't have a shield, they also neft the shields so killing enemies is 10x harder now don't brother playing a game that your only gonna play for 2 days then quit because the amount of low level booster that keep on killing you tea baging etc also the fans are toxic as hell so good luck finding a player who doesn't say the n word of f word every 5 seconds.
no monitoring at all
Great game modes to try
Violence is suitable for a 7 year old, but the online chat mode makes it more mature.
Its good exept for one major problem
It not bad for kids
Good But Toxic
Devs don't care at all
Appropriate, Fun Game
classic shooter
Solid, mostly clean FPS. Almost all of the story and positive messages comes from online media.
The gameplay is just pristine
Please read this review
Absolutely unmoderated chat.
Great game!
Like tf2 for younger kids
I cant believe these reviews are true
The game is not worth the money or time that people put into it. With every single update that is released it just gets worse and honestly the game is dead, it is also full of toxic players, so I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have a positive experience.
horrible gift won't not recommended
it is a common problem that really good players create fake accounts as low level players and then enter the game and demolish beginners. also behavior on online chat is shocking. they need better monitoring without a doubt.
Overwatch is now my favorite game. It has a lot of game modes and I can't be boring by playing them. In some events or anniversaries, they also published new games and some of them are based on the story of Overwatch. I can't wait till next year to try more new games in Overwatch 2. My two favorite game is "Mystery Heroes" and the new game mode published in 2019 " Hero Gauntlet" because I was allowed to try others heros but won't be blame playing them badly for the reason that the hero was randomly chosen. Great shooting game for main support like me
Overwatch is a really fun game and with minimal violence most kids will want to play it. However the main issue with this is that the game is only multiplayer, and because of this, the player will (probably) be autimaticlly set to be able to chat with random strangers. Now this can be turned of in the settings, but it can still be easily turned back on. Apart from that being the main issue, there isnt really much else in the game that would make it inappropriate for kids, however there is some issues with mild violence where players go 1st person playing as a fantasy character trying to kill the other players, however its very unrealistic and if it were a movie it would most likley be rated PG. Apart from this Overwatch is very fun game which all ages will enjoy.
The only problem i have with this is open chat so be sure your child is not gullible enough to fall for any scams and is able to deal with heated situations cooly Other than that the characters are great. There is a lot of diversity in the roster ranging from A fully armored, hammer wielding german to a VERY perky time shifting British young lady
There is nothing bad about this game there is no blood. it not realistic there are gorilla in power suits and robot so I think the game should be 6+
This is a pretty well made game with really cool characters. It's very diverse featuring characters of many different backgrounds from all over the world working together. There are very strong female characters and a LGBTQ+ presence. It is a first person shooter game based around protecting objectives in teams, however there is a very toxic fanbase. I would recommend that you have a tough skin and be able to put up with needless bullying from people in the game, and able to calmly handle it. You can ignore the chat and not participate, but people still kind of suck. It is also rather unbalanced and can be a bit infuriating. And if your child plays the character Mercy a lot, they are going to become severely tired and upset. 'Mercy Mains' feel a lot of pain.
The developers at blizzard did a fine job advertising and selling this game but now they are not adding anything new so far. This is an amazing game but they need to add something new.
I have been playing this game going on 2 years now and it is a fantastic game that promotes team play and cooperation. There is no gore and very little blood with no offensive language present in the game. Players can choose interact with random people who are on their team by joining game chat, and other players can sometimes use offensive language and/or be extremely insulting. There is an “avoid as teammate” option for players who you found offensive, rude, and/or insulting.
Some smoking and alcohol references are evident. The gun toting character Mcree smokes too many cigars I am surprised he never gets ill! The maps are littered with empty beer and wine bottles. Violence is the main component but there is no realistic blood or guts to speak of and so if the smoking and alcohol references are acceptable then this game is suitable for ages 9 and upwards. Voice chat is available but can be disabled.
As far as first person shooters go, Overwatch isn't very intense, with only mild (but common) violence, and some sexualized character designs. The games' story is told through free online short animations and comics, so any positive or negative messages or themes are expressed outside of the actual game. Violence: Players use all sorts of firearms to dispatch each other, but no actual gun brands are used. Instead, most weapons are futuristic laser guns. That being said, some characters still use bullets, and there are even a few melee weapons, like maces and swords. successful attacks are highlighted by small splashes of blood. The most violent imagery in the game comes from the use of a bow and arrow, as the arrows will imbued themselves in the enemy's body, and stay there, leading to some slightly grisly images, such as an arrow sticking out of a corpse's head. Sexuality: Some female characters wear revealing or tight fitting clothing. Positive messages/role models: The game's multinational cast is very diverse, with many races and both genders being represented by heroic figures. The cast also includes several homosexual characters. The online story generally teaches tolerance and promotes selflessness, with the main conflict centering around the struggle of a race of self aware robots to be considered equal to humans. (Paralleling racial struggles in real life.) language: Mild cusses like "H**l" "D**m" "B*****d" are occasionally spoken by the characters. Players can use some mild swears in the text chat, but the heftier curses will be censored into asterisks (unless this feature is disabled in the options.) Still, there is nothing stopping players from using inappropriate language in voice chat. Consumerism: Players receive cosmetic items indirectly through "loot boxes" which are unlocked by playing the game for a certain amount of time, and will give the player four random items when opened. Alternatively, the player can buy them with real money, and there is still no guarantee they will get the item they wanted. tobacco use: One character is constantly smoking a cigar.
The game play in the video review does not justify how violent this game is l. It encourages team play and shorting people in order to kill them . Some of the voice lines characters say are very inspiring. When I bought this game for my kid I said “Scoot your butt over let me try!” That is now why I yell in the middle of the night. The rank I play at is very competitive it says in the game that I’m in the 1%of players. This game is really really really really hard. It is easy to play hard to master.
I rated this game 11+ for violence and bad language, violence 3/5 when you kill human players there is a small chance you could see some blood, this game allows you to use a variety of weapons to kill enemy players, bows guns, swords, rocket launchers, hammers and lasers, though the game is cartoony. Bad language 4/5 you can speak in game chat, leaving you vulnerable to bad language, though this can be turned off in settings. Please don't be like other parents and buy your 5 yr old this game.
This game itself is likely appropriate for 8+, but the online community surrounding this game absolutely skews young adult (18-35). Due to the demographic of the players, there is ubiquitous swearing and pointed insults (including threats referencing gender-violence, racial slurs, and homophobic rants) etc. The language in this game from the players is at least as bad as anything you'd hear in some of the most profanity-laced R-rated movies out there (as in at least 10% of chat is likely active swearing). If you would not feel comfortable with your children hearing recordings at raucous college parties, I would not allow them free access to this game, as open vioce and type chat are one keystroke away, and most teams will specifically want players to have mics and be talking throughout the games. I have played this game for 1000s of hours. It is extremely fun and I would encourage any adult who enjoys first person shooter games to try it out, however, parents should keep in mind that it is not in anyway an emotionally safe community for children, and even sensitive young teens may find the bully-nature of many of the toxic members of the community too much to handle. Another issue any online game with unmoderated chat is the linking to external chat sites (such as discord) which operate as unmoderated online communities where kids can be even more vulnerable to adults online. We have a few older teens in the discord I frequent and it always makes me wonder if their parents know they are spending time in online spaces full of adults. I have met many online friends, but for children and teens it would just be incredibly easy for predators to meet, groom, and access children through these games. I would not recommend allowing children or young teens to play unless you are actively playing with them and can hear and see what is going on in chat.
The game can be a little violent, but it's still a great game. Kids enjoy it and adults enjoy it. The characters a creative and strange. The game is great and I really like playing it.
I don’t really hate this game, but I don’t like it either.. it’s a lot like team fortress two (which is more mature) it’s a team shooter where each player chooses a class to play each round, the game has many game modes, key modes are capture point and payload. Capture point is where you capture points and advance.. payload is where you escort a cart to different areas till you reach the end. If your kid want to play this, before dropping money on it I highly advise to have a round on TeamFortress 2 (even if you test it first!) as it’s what overwatch is based on, and it’s free!
I bought this recently to try before letting the kids play (they are both 13) it as its an online only game I wanted to check what the gaming community was like and how the game was managed. I played a couple match's most days for about a week or two and encountered various forms of racism / hate speech /bullying among other awful behavior. It was about 50/50 chance of a match ending badly with people screaming, arguing or insulting each other. I contacted the company Blizzard several times about various players that had acted in such a way to see how they are dealt with as I was placed in another game a few times with the same players. Sadly all I received was an automated response each time for the company. I friended one abusive player to see how long it took him to be banned for racist slurs etc he was still playing after several reports and emails to the company as where other players. I would not let anyone under 16 years old play this at the minimum, there is far to much abusive /racist and toxic players for kids to have a good time. Alot of angry adults play this game to vent steam. There is also a vast amount of players with several accounts - which the company knows about - so they have no real threat of being banned or removed from the game, which allows them to continue to be abusive etc. The company seems to have left the game to run itself with automated programs for reporting players etc I thankfully bought the game through PayPal as i was aware the company doesn't give refunds so i managed to get my money back that way. I have also noted the in game loot box's are being banned in several countries due to encouraging gambling behavior in children. Do not buy this game for your kids. If your 16+ at least then go ahead jump in the cesspool of subhuman filth you will meet in this game. Absolutely shocking community.
Great game
no problems, just legal stuff
How good overwatch is
Best game I have ever played.
Go over the watch!
Amazing!
Toxic players will ruin your child's experience
Over Sexualized Characters (Not suitable for children)
NO BLOOD AND PROMOTES TEAMWORK
Paladins Clone
overwatch
Overwatch contains violence and its not for your kids
If you want to develop a rage problem
Gave my dad nightmares
Best game for starters!
Be careful what your children get into!
This is a lie.
Amazing!
Overwatch
I have 300+ hours of gameplay worth it if they like FPS . All I've heard is damn and hell. The most scantily clad women is in a bathing suit for the summer event. Only thing to watch out for is voice chat. People are very toxic around this game. Like early COD toxic.
there is nothing bad, just a cowboy smokin` a cigar. there in movies. whats the problem? its barely visible!
Overwatch is a great game for chidren. As a parent i think the violence is very limited so it is a perfect game for my child. I do reccomend that other parents by it as well.
This game is good first person shooter. I love it! But, make sure it's ok, because it TEEN RATED.
The game is friendly! Cartoon characters fighting. Kinda like smash... But, better. Although, their is a chat filter and a cigar with one of the characters. But it is still friendly!
After having played this game with my child, I cannot describe in good enough detail just how toxic and vulgar other players are. And since the game is multiplayer (online only) there really isn't a way to avoid this. The game itself isn't substantially violent or lewd, but the people that play it will do their best to ruin your night. Avoid this one.
My only issues with this game come from the over sexualization of certain female characters in the game that I don’t think are a good influence for my son (13) and definitely a terrible example for my daughter(11). Some of the “skins” (different outfits) for the character Widowmaker and especially the default one look more like body paint rather than outfits appropriate for a game for children. I encourage other parents to look into this: https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/widowmaker/
Overwatch is not graphic and promotes teamwork by making you work together with a team and finish the objective.
Look up Widowmaker
It is a good game. At first I did not want my son to get the game as I was scared of him playing with guns. However, I did my research observed the game being played and reluctantly gave in. It has turned out not to be so bad after all and my son really enjoys playing it. Personally, I suggest it for kids 10+ because it can scare younger children but other than that its a safe game for youth.
This game has blood and Charaters who are over sexualized to appeal to older male community charaters swear almost every kill you get a cowboy is clearly smoking a cigar whice makes your kids want to do the same thing
Community is so toxic, If you want your kids to develop a rage issue or even some adults. Stay away from this game.
Your child should probably stay with roblox.
This is a great game for people who are just starting out gaming and would like something that is not too hard to master and get good at. It has a system that you will mostly come up against people at the same level or stage in the game as you. It is only online pvp with a selection of modes like capture the point escort the payload and finally a hybrid witch you have to capture a to get to escort the payload. There is a selection of about 24 heroes that each have different play styles and difficulties . Overall I think it is a great game that I enjoy playing a lot and I hope you will too!
Overwatch is a game that has an absolutely horrible community and design team. The community during play is aggressive, racist, sexist, and everything in between. There is an African american hero that is commonly played and comments, both in chat and verbally, such as "Don't play the nigg***" or "Get that ghetto trash out of the game" are not uncommon. Overwatch doesn't censor anything - and because of that, the community has grown rampant. The design team is more involved in creating a game and not patrolling their actual communication within that game that I would not recommend this game to any parent with a child below 18.
This is undoubtedly a kid friendly game. I don't know what this fool writer was doing when he wrote 2 stars for sex. There's barely any "sexual" content at all, with the most revealing dresses showing stomach and very few being skintight suits (which are admittedly still not that bad). As for the violence, of course there's going to be violence! It's a shooter. Duh. There's one character shown smoking a cigar, because he is a cowboy. There's options to turn off chat and voice chat to protect your children. There's no blood. I noticed the review saying, "characters get dismembered and fall apart." There's not a single character in the game that falls apart or gets dismembered. There's training robots that fall apart. That's it. And they aren't people like robots, they are squares. It promotes teamwork and is easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's absolutely nothing like the violent, edgy shooter that this website makes it appear to be. Do not listen to this site for this one. It doesn't know what it's talking about. I believe you should refer to the comments for this one. This is definitely one of the most mild FPS games out there.
I've been playing Overwatch for a while now. My sister let me play it, and now I'm addicted! It is a great game for adolescents ( 11+ ) to play. There are some things in the game for teens, like a sort of revealing outfit, light smoking, some LIGHT curse words ( damn, hell ) and some real curse words in other languages, but the real curse words are rare, and only happen in appropriate moments. This game is really 11+ because sometimes it can be extra difficult. On to the characters. There are so many! All of them come from different places, like Japan, China, Russia, Nigeria, Sweden, Korea, Britan, the list is so long! They also have some Omnics, AKA robots, and they even have an LGBT character with a girlfriend. They beautifully express how diversity makes a game SO much better. If you're kid turned 10/11, is a gamer, and is getting more mature and moving on from Skylanders, PVZ, Duckhunt, etc. The company that created this game, Blizzard, have also made cinematic shorts on the characters from Overwatch, and grab the tissues, they're SO heartwarming. Overall, this game has a gorgeously diverse cast, a differentiated but understandable demographic, and is set up amazingly. STOP READING THIS REVIEW, AND GO BUY OVERWATCH!
No drugs, profanity, blood, and language.
