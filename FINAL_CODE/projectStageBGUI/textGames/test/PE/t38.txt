Good
op game
Ring fit is amazing!
The ring is kinda flirty though
op game pro game for getting strong op
I just want to tell you that this is a really good fit game and I highly recomend it!
Enjoyed the game, but its not the best in the series
the hack and slash game play is repetitive, but it isn't necessarily bad. I've played many RPGs, so I'm pretty used to repetitive game play. The story was really interesting, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. It wasn't the best game, but it had something about it that brought me to it. I feel like people who are 13+ could play the game, but it depends on the person. This is why I gave it 15+. The game is not the best by any means, but it has a charm to it that can be seen as enjoyable. I would say that the other No More Heroes games are better, but it is alright.
Challenging puzzler!
I rated this a 12 and older only because of the violence. Felix is a fun character and is mostly seen dancing his way through life. there are instances of decapitation. the whole thing is basically a puzzle that leads to a killing.
Very good for family game nights
I had a 3-page-long review but it deleted itself because I went to a different tab.
Amazing Game
Good party game.
We got Jackbox a few months back, and so far, it's been amazing! We have a blast playing it with our cousins, and it's made even better by the fact that we can do it and have fun even when we're 1000 miles apart. Here's some more information. SETUP AND USE: We do Jackbox through Steam on Windows 10. It was very easy to download, setup, and play. The only downside (a minor one) is that you have to have a separate host device from which you run it, but having as many computers and tablets as we do, it's not a problem. Connecting to a game is very easy to do, and as long as you have a good internet connection you shouldn't experience problems with being disconnected. THE GAMES: We ourselves have done every single game except for Trivia Murder Party 2 (just in case it isn't appropriate for the younger kids in the family), and we love them all. Each is uniquely different and will provide hours of fun. In Role Models, there may be a few subjects that younger ones won't understand, but all the games we do have a family-friendly setting so we can play worry-free. Overall, Jackbox is a very good platform for family game nights, getting together with friends, and having a great time. I recommend.
So yeah, I had the best review ever, but when I tried to post my review, it deleted. Just buy it already.
It is a great party game and it is really fun to play. In every pack there are 5 games. 4 of them have family friendly mode and the other one usually doesn’t. So as long as you make sure family friendly turned on it should be fine. One problem is everyone must have a device with a web browser.
Really good party game. Five party games smashed into one. The thing you should watch out is Trivia Murder Party. It is pretty disturbing, over all it's a good game for the family.
CSM Back At It Again With The Too Old Ratings
Attention to parents who won't let their child get the game.
Here goes CSM horrible rating
Fun Game but toxic online community
Another CMS over rating.
Perhaps the most kid-friendly FPS out there
No Drugs Or Sex
This Game is made for kids! and teens but id say both 8+ and also common sense doesn't say that it says bad words it says the damn and hell so enjoy this game so awesome!!
CMS know how to over exaggerate
DON'T LISTEN TO CSM!
Great game, Least Violent FPS Game I've ever played.
Amazing for 10+
Best Game Ever
A battleground full of character!!!
Very solid game
Action packed FPS for teens and kids alike.
Good game
Really CSM?
Great first FPS game
Overwatch.........
Here is the motto of Common Sense Media. "If the game is teen it must be rated by us 13 or higher" But come on this is Overwatch. Overwatch has no profanity, sex, or drugs. I don't count a cowboy smoking tobbaco drugs. He isn't smoking a blunt. I don't count a mildly provocative character as sex. Bare nudity? No. Full Nudity? No. Sex Scenes? No! Sex is at a 0. Of course there is violence in a fighting game! But the blood is about as equal to the Skylanders series which is at a 5 for commercialism because having all characters will cost a whopping 3000 dollars (around). However this game got a 4 rating which is one measly less. All you buy in this game is cosmetics not freaking characters like SkyScammers and BattleBorn The Leach. CMS states the game has lots of merchandise like t-shirts and toys. Every game does. But not everygame has a level 4 on commercialism! Characters getting dismembered? Why is this in the age review!!! The training robots and one robotic character will fall apart upon death with no blood! Just like in SkyScammers. Honestly an 8 year old can play this game without it tainting their mind but they'll never get the chance when parents see the number 13 up there. Take it from me. This is fine for the average eight year old! There are also pretty good messages and role models with a very nice moral background which communicates the goods and bads of wars as well as multiple viewpoints too not only educate but immerse their viewers in a realistic world that is unrealistic. LOL! It's very easy to play the game. Characters take seconds to learn but hours to master just like a good fighting game should do. Button mashing will get you nowhere but good reflexes, playstyle, and strategy will! The game is a blast and CMS is famous for not allowing great games to be played by younger audiences when they should be!
This is the most kid friendly FPS I've ever played. There is no sexual content or swearing. The violence is NOTHING compared to a 12+ movie and I think a 10 year old of average maturity should be fine with this game. There is virtually no blood and if parents are concerned about the shooting, you are playing as the good guy fighting the bad guy and it doesn't look very realistic. Also most of the time you are fighting against cartoony robots not real people. The game is actually very cartoony and doesn't look real at all. The game also helps with your child's team building skills and reaction times. If your child is over 10 or 11 parents should have nothing to worry about, it's NOWHERE near as violent as most 12+ movies and overall a kid-teen friendly game, so this is a great gift for ages 10 and over.
Okay, before we start, I have been playing OverWatch since launch. I currently sit in the diamond rank which people believe to be the most toxic. Yes, there is a bad egg or two, but there is no reason that this game should be given a rating like CSM did. The game includes many things to get rid of them. The game allows you to avoid people, so you don’t end up in their voice chat and there is the option of leaving a voice channel and muting them. The game includes no drugs, unless you think a cowboy with a cigar is worthy of a drug rating. He’s also smoking a normal cigar, not weed or crack. No sex in the game, to be honest nothing bad at all. Would highly recommend
This game is really fun and not very inappropriate ... UNTIL you turn on voice chat, people are either extremely toxic(mean) or say stupid stuff. Some of the outfits are slightly revealing but who cares, it's not that bad. There also isn't a lot of blood and for some reason some of the time the characters yell out "d*mn" but not very frequently. **Avoid competitive if you play on PC because the ranking system is really bad and even if you are really good you'll stay in Gold or below unless you are a pro. It's just toxic and rage inducing, no one should have to go through it kid or adult, just stick to arcade and quick play unless you are a pro***
Listen, listen. As a video game connoisseur i think I have the right to speak on the matter on this game. Children are gullible, I know, I shouldn’t be saying it. But the fact of the matter is this is the most family friendly shooter game ever made. I got this game at the age of ten, and I will never forget some of the incredibly nice people on this game. Sure, there are some “toxic” gamers who play Overwatch, however, they are generally nice once you calm them down and get to know them. There is 2 bits of profanity from the characters, however it is hardly noticeable even if you have good ears. Team building is key in this game. If anyone says different I suggest they actually play the game and see for themselves. Communicating with other teammates about “not pressing” or “staying back” is litterally the basis of the entire game. A child with the maturity of a goldfish could play this game. This game is the best shooter game if you don’t want your children to have the more violent, grotesque games like COD or Battlefield.
While there are ever-so-slightly less violent FPS that have managed to get an E/E10+ rating, I would consider Overwatch the more kid-friendly game. As Common Sense Media mentioned in their review, Overwatch has unique good messages to it, such as that morality is not always black or write, how to overcome obstacles and work with others. The violence is relatively mild, even when compared to other T-rated shooters. For example, Halo 5 had a bit more realism to it, and the blood splatter was on-screen for longer. In Overwatch, blood is infrequent, and the whole game has an abstract style to it separating it easily from reality.
There is no sex or drugs in it other than the cigar used by one of the characters. This game focuses on strategy rather than violence and teaches kids a lot about tactics. There is no point to not get this game for your children. Great game! I think kids 8 and under cannot handle the online interactions although, and thus I rate it 9 and up!
great game for your kids
The common sense media review is completely ridiculous. There is 0 sex AT ALL. There are 0 drugs AT ALL. The closest you can get to a drug is a cowboy smoking a cigar, but what do you expect? PG tv shows have people smoking cigars soo what's the problem? Very little blood, guns are cooler than they are dangerous. Dismemberment of a character? There's a robot character when he dies spring and screws go everywhere... When a character explodes, it's body just turns to a rag doll. I hate the poor kids that are told no over getting this game because CSM said its 13+ and gave false info.
I don't know why CSM says that it is 14+! The only thing I can think of is unmoderated chat. It helps teamwork, communication, and thinking ahead. You work in a team of 6 to either take control of, or defend a certain point, and players need to communicate to do well. It has MILD violence, nothing very bad. Some characters, such as Widowmaker, have some cleavage, but not as bad as some things. Overall, an amazing game, I would recommend this to anyone (who is mature) 8+.
Overwatch is an excellent game and definently one of my favorites. It's nothing like any other FPS game I've ever played. I would personally say that this should be rated E10+ rather than T. For some reason, CMS says that character dismememberment is in this game, when a character dies there is NO dismemberment (except for the ROBOTIC character, Bastion). Also, over half of the roster doesn't have guns (not counting laser guns as a gun). There is extremely little blood that is rarely seen. This game also isn't like a normal FPS game that's extremely dark. The overall vibe of the game is about heroism. And the graphics are in an animated Pixar style. This game has no sex, and no drugs or alcohol. One character smokes a cigar, though. I would highly recommend this game to any family with children 10 or over.
First of, lets get something out the way, by no means is this game stereotypical or sexist. Yes, some women have revealing outfits, but the same could be said for some of the men. You could say the characters use "drugs" to heal themselves which even saying that is over exaggerating. And literally there is no blood or gore just a few bullets so the violence is low to a mature standard. Now the ACTUAL game, its excellent. While sometimes it gets a little bit repetetive, the character and feel-good vibe with the bright map design could keep you addicted for hours. Also, teamwork and skill is a LARGE part of this game so young children might learn a thing or two. Over all, Its brilliant. Go out and buy it RIGHT NOW.
Overwatch is a very solid game, really fun and easy to play. It is an FPS with guns but there isn't any blood and the guns look really futuristic and more cool than violent. Nothing wrong with this game at all. As long as you know how to play as a team and with good strategy this is great.
If this isn't kid friendly, i dont know what is. One of the characters is a hamster from the moon. And for the alleged "tobacco usage", it's one character (also, is there a kid who doesn't know that you shouldn't smoke by now?). Ninjas, cowboys, robots, more robots, what's not to like? The violence and shooting is very mild. Most don't even use bullets, it's usually just lasers. Blood? Please. Other than a red outline of the screen when you're hit, there's nothing. Players just go ragdoll when they die. No gore or anything. It's also not very realistic. Almost every aspect is cartoony. It also teaches strategy, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. The conflict is also good guys vs. bad guys. like anything, really. This is a great game for kids and literally anybody. (P.s.: if you dont want voice chat, just turn it off.)
Great game you can get rid of the cigar and no sex is in it. Very little blood if it did not say it on the rating would not know it was their.
Common sense media has rated this too high once again. Parents, ignore the comment about the character McCree, as he is only smoking a cigarette, and you cannot even see it once you are in game. Yes, there is voice chat, but you can turn that off in settings. There is no blood, just a little red ring around the edge of your screen when you are hurt. The guns are futuristic and not realistic in the slightest. Overall great game and CSM has rated it too high on age
I've been playing for a few weeks and its really easy to get the hang of. The blood is very minimal. Yes some of the heroes have fairly revealing clothing *cough*Widow maker*cough*. Over all a great game and definitely suggest trying it.
Overwatch is an extremely fun game to play but unless you have parental controls then anything could happen. There is a lot of violence seeing as this is a first person shooter game but it has good role models and messages as the characters back stories most if the time display good things :). But sometimes swear words are used in certain characters, and sometimes there are mentions of alcohol and drugs there are some styles of characters that's have reveling clothing and some styles of the characters are super reavling especially a style if the character widow. There is a chat where kids can type whatever they want including personal information and swearing or there is a mic feature and just be careful about those as as I said anything could happen. Other than that overwatch is an amazing game but parents just set some parental controls on your console or pc or whatever just be to sure everything is right for your child. Happy playing!!
