Had to ask for a refund
May contain violence and some words to look out for. BUT ITS A GREAT ADVENTURE!
Weak plot, great gameplay
There is a lot of swearing and naming of Jesus's ame in vain (as another swear word). I waited for a year to buy it for my kids and sadly we had to take return it after discovering that "coarse lanhuage" meant blaspheming as well.
I think this game is very good it has an awesome story. The game is about going on different missions with a fighter jet to save to stop the war. The game is good on the story details and graphics and music rhythms for each mission. 5 stars! Watch out for swearing, and excessive violence.
Game is pretty difficult, but extremely rewarding to play. Despite some...inaccuracies (*cough* having over a 100 missles on a plane *cough*), there are many great mechanics keeping the game fresh to the end. Clouds mess with missle tracking and ice your plane, wind can throw you way off course, at one point IFF system changes, forcing you to scan every target before letting you know if they are an enemy or not. The plot is lacking hovewer. There are several big plot holes, pieces of incoherent dialogue and bits where you have to actually sit and think about what even happened. Also, it strongly assumes the player having considerable knowledge of the game's universe. In short, the plot is more of a nostalgia hook than it's own thing. In terms of "inappropriate content", there are only two major moments coming to my mind. In one, an antagonist chases your ally, but not killing her until she has a complete mental breakdown from fear. The second one is subtler, it has your AWACS tricking your ally into executing another one for pretty much no reason, other than personal dislike.
Fun for the whole family!
Very fun
We recently finished running through this title with our 4 year old. This version of the game introduces the new child friendly character Nabbit who is immune to nearly all enemies in the game. This allows this game to be more approachable to a younger audience. Playing in tandem with my wife and I created a very enjoyable play experience. All the themes and characters were approachable for a 4 year old. Highly recommended!
This is the best version of Super Mario Bros I have ever played. And I have played it on a Nintendo 3DS and a Wii U. This is like the updated and better quality version of the original 1996 version of Super Mario Bros. And I think everyone knows that Nintendo Switch games are CRAZY expensive. I would not say it is worth the $60. Especially since you can get the game on a DS or Wii U for $10. This is a family friendly game. For all ages.
Under 6 controls are hard to learn
Hey
Good
this is how the review should be
It's a beat'em'up with no blood or gore.
Eh... Maybe
why is smash ulltimate rated e10+
SO MUCH FUN
Love this game :)
Truly the ULTIMATE game
its a game where you attack people but it should not get this 12 + rating it should have a 9+
Given the genre it is exactly what you'd expect, punching, kicking, throwing fire balls etc. but all very tame. A really good beat'em'up with a tonne of content.
This game is revolved around fighting which already is a minus, In this game u can master the game pretty easily but its not too good for new gamers, but overall besides the violence and the consumerism its not that bad!
Because smash has special skills but there is no blood and gore added to the game. There is no bad language but some characters wear skylight suits which shows some sex refrences but there is no alcohol and drug abuse in this game.
I play this game soo much that it is embarrassing. Great game if you want to have a family game night. Well, family game night for kids 9+... I suggest to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch. Retails at $59.99 — What’s in the game? Violence - Violence is the point of the game, as you brawl against every character for domination. You'll use fists, feet, weapons, objects, special skills to defeat enemies by launching them off the screen. Cartoonish nature and lack of blood and gore lighten impact of gameplay. Privacy Concerns - Can play with people all around the world. Sexy Costumes - Some female characters wear skintight costumes.
Better than your dumb reviews
Packed with content that will keep me playing for years to come. Every Switch owner should buy this game
good open world game
Its not bad
good game but would not let lads under 11 play
Just Cause 4
This game is like overwatch but a little bit more violent and no voice chat only solo and duo
Broken but fun

B
Great game for kids 9 and over
Good for 10+
Read before rejecting for your child
A lot of Fun! Fine for kids 11/12+
Great Game Great For Kids
What an Experinece Playing a Just Cause Game
Best Game Ever.
Boom
Explosive Simulator
good open world game
common sense states there is mindless violence. the truth is that the main protagonist (the person you play as) is actually trying to liberate a region held by a mercenary group known for violence and brutality. there is little to no blood. the only blood you see is when you hit the ground or little spurts come out when you shoot the enemies. this is not grand theft auto 5 violence that can be seen with civilians. in this game theres no blood when you shoot them they simply fall to the ground and after awhile disappear. what I have the most fun doing is creating big explosions with the many gadgets you have to play around with not to mention the great scenery and vistas. This game really should be rated T for teen
I have watched my son play it with his friends and there in very low profanity and no graphic violence. My son is 10 and he is not effected by the game play.
Just Cause 4 is a huge improvement on it's predecessor, with improved controls, a great open-world map, and many new gadgets to mess around with. It's not perfect - the game still feels a bit clunky and the story is pretty straight forward with no twists or turns whatsoever. The main highlight of Just Cause 4 is definitely Rico's gadgets, I've honestly spent hours just messing around with them. The game just wouldn't be the same without them - can you imagine a Just Cause game without a grappling hook or wingsuit? Me neither. For both newcomers and veterans of the series, Just Cause 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new and exciting game to play. 8/10.
This game is very cool is a game left for 10/11 year old because of the violence other wise nice game but NOT 18!!
Very little blood. Cartoonish violence. No swearing. Ok for teens. PG13 stuff.
I think kids thirteen and up should be able to play it. It isn’t as violent as common sense media says it is.
Great game, good for all ages (almost)
It says just cause 4 has the f-word but it does not. I have heard it say the s-word twice.
If you are not happy with swearing in the game, there is a setting that will allow you to turn the voices off. Otherwise, it only has 2-3 swear words in the entire game. A little blood may come from the characters in the game. The corpses will despawn after 20 seconds or so. There will be burning bodies if you use an explosive near a NPC (non-playable character). The flame does nothing to the body and will despawn. I think this is a VERY good game and that you should get it soon. DLCs are not overpriced and are in a price range from 1$ to 15$.
This is a very nice game.It was violence but without blood.I think it’s ok.It has some bad words but I don’t think it’s a problem because the children at this age don’t know them
I personally love the Just Cause franchise. I think that Just Cause 4 is another great game with a lot of chaos! You can fly planes, drive cars, and sail boats! And the main thing you do is cause chaos! Heck, you can fly a plane into a tornado. Although there is a lot of violence, killing, gunfire, and explosions, it’s is pretty good. Although you can kill innocent bystanders, it is nothing that graphic. You basically just shoot them and there’s blood and they fall dead to the ground. Same with explosives, they fly up into the air and hit the ground dead. That’s just basically what it is like. Other than that and a few cursing and drug use, (some AI’s will be smoking or drinking) the feeling of using a rocket launcher at a enemy’s car or causing a huge gas tank explosion is so cool. I think that as long as your kid can handle killing and explosions, they would be fine.
The Game has like 2 swear words which your young kids wont even know what they are characters don't bleed. However there is a large explosive world for your kid to experiment in. Buy It Just Cause
There is little swearing with only about 2 or 3 words in the whole game. It has no blood when attacking other people. However it does have a lot of explosions. As the main object in the game is to cause as much destruction as possible. Love this Game and You will love it too trust me on that one. Maybe 7 is a bit of a push but you will know when your child is ready and my child is ready I am sure however for the average child I am pretty sure about 9 or 10 would be a correct age to play it at
It has minimal swearing (about 2 or 3 words in the whole game) and when you fight people it has little gore with no blood coming out however it has explosions. If you think your kid is mature enough to play a game like this let them play it and you will have no regrets.
It is a very high quality game and some violence however not that much not showcasing very little blood it also does not include very much swearing with about only 3 words in the whole game if your child is mature enough they could cope with the language of 3 swear words and the little gore as well as a few explosions get them this game and they will love it here in the Uk you also get a good deal at game with a steelbook edition for only £54.99 Great Game would recomend for any pre-teen 9 and up for a gift You have also got to remember the game is single player though and provides no multiplayer experience Give your kid freedom over what they play if the like the game and it is within a reasonable amount of swearing gore or violence get them it if they like it. This does not Just aply for this game it aplys for many 18s and 16s too give you kid more freedom parents
I am fine with my children playing this and also the violence is about 3 out of 5 there is one or two swear words throughout the story if you do not like explosives do not play this or let your kid play this however if your kid is mature enough then they could play this from about 9 or 10 up also if your kid has recomended this game they are probably ready to play it becuase they will know about game well.

Not very violent and a little confusing.
Very good game!
The best Persona game to start with
If you have never played a Persona game and you are above maybe 12 then play Persona 5, but if you are younger than that play this.It is so good and the song are AMAZING, but if you don't like rhythm games don't play even if if you like Persona.
It’s a great game
It’s good
This game is not that bad of a game the violence is animated And doesn’t look realistic and also your fighting demons not humans so you have that going for you
It’s really fun and not to violent even if the name suggests it so 11 up should be fine playing this game
Appropriate for kids who known about WW2
It has a ton of gore and language but not that bad!
Great Game
Violence and blood, great gameplay
Great Educational Game That Should Be In All Classrooms
It has some violence but not something a 13 year old haven't played yet
Fun and exiting game!
Scampers away from the original charm of the series but is very fun.
Fun game with mild vilonce and language with historcly true dates, weapons and vehicles
Fun, historically inaccurate, kids can handle the violence
Perfect for ages 13 and up
good game
NOT BAD GOOD FOR PRETEENS
Great game!
Safe Violent Video game. But sacrifices preservation of actual history
Very good
Please read this review
Disrespects ww2 vets
Shocked by the language
There is not much blood in the game, if someone gets shot, stabbed or blown up the just go limp with a small squirt of blood. There isint to much language, nothing that a mature 10+ year old couldn't handle. The game is also very good so your child should like it. My 12 year old daughter asked for it so I checked it out and I think before you let your kids play this game you should watch something like band of brothers or saving private ryan with them and if you they can handle that then they are pretty much good to go, just make sure they also know a good amount about WW2 and then I think you It is fine for them. Also sorry if my English isn't that good it is my second language.
If you have played things like call of duty world war 2 then you can start playing this game and i mean like... why not? A 12 year old is just starting to grow up and use this language when you are not looking so honestly... like i said before why not
I, a parent of 2 kids both are 11 and they say the game is great and I haven't seen a drop of blood or even a bad word so I think everybody should get it and its the perfect gift for any teen.
When you are downed and a Brit, You yell," Help, im f*cking hurtin." Also if you shoot someone in the head, a large mass of blood emerges. Great fun though, gunplay is one of the best. Some microtransactions, but only for cosmetics/
Has great messages that support gender equality and acceptance of all religions, races, and cultures. Many of my students learned lots about how people from different backgrounds live. I love this teaching device and am so glad a tool like this has come to the public to make learning so much better and accessible to all.
I think its ok for teens and up. Not tweens and kids though.
All around this game is great. the most swearing comes around when you're playing as a brit. Blood/Gore: If your child has seen movies such as Saving Private Ryan or 1917, the gore is a lot less than those movies. the most gory part are when enemies are being stabbed. swearing includes 2-3 f-words per game (depends if you're playing as a brit or not.) 4-5 s**t per game. thanks for reading my review and if you get the game, have as much fun is i have had! :)
I am a professional PEGI reviewer. ( I gave this PEGI 16)This game is a must-have for teens. The violence is slightly overstated in the review. There is a very evident bloody spray when enemies are shot. There is a long-lasting blood mist when enemies are sniped. There is brief gore when enemies are shot. The game only shows evident gore when enemies are stabbed. The violence in my opinion is 8.5/10. Games which have this level of violence are Sekiro(8.7/10), the ghost of Tsushima(8.4/10), AC Unity(9/10). There is a great deal of language, f**k, sh*t, hell, damn, bastard, m*therf*cker, c*nt, ass, are all used commonly. The language is 9.6/10.(Worth noting that HARSH language is only used by brits.) A few games which has this much language is GTA V(10/10), and Gears 5(9.8/10), and not much more. It is worth noting that language is only harsh when playing as a brit.(There is one 10 min war story without around 20 f words!) Language is present when playing as an American and German but the language is not as harsh(s words and b words) and they speak their native tongue. I think that the chaos of the multiplayer and the emotional power of the last tiger war story overshadow some of this mature content. This makes the game perfect for teens, thank you!
As a mother of 2 one being 11 while the other just 3 I think this fun historically based game is suitable for my 11 year old son as the only vilonce is a small bit of blood and not heads being blown off the language used is nothing my 11 almost 12 year old son dose not know, words used are words like shit and ass so nothing to bad. Great game kids would love it
This game isn’t anything special, but it is fun to play and has a good multiplayer. The violence in the game consists of anything you could do in an actual war, mainly being guns, knives, and explosives. There is blood but not really any gore, and the blood is minimal. There is explicit language in cutscenes, but it’s nothing a teen wouldn’t hear in the hallways. My main problem with the game is that it isn’t historically accurate. Guns are much more diverse and colorful than they actually were and the campaign, (except for “The Last Tiger,) is made up or incorrect in many aspects. The most historically accurate experience in this game is the conquest game mode.
This game is perfect for kids who can handle a bit of violence and blood, know that none of it is real ww2 footage and isn’t a sociopath. Perfect for lads named Tom L
it is only violent in the war stories so if you let your kid play i surgest not letting them play the campain
Fine for eleven or up, violence blood, language, but language is mainly in the cutscenes which you can skip
It's both educational and fun, and I think should be played by everyone age 9+!
Battlefield 5 is the fifth one in the legendary selling series. But I know you don't care about that, I know why you are here. Is this game violent? Unless you find pg-13 action movies too much for your child then no. Will this desensitize my kid and turn him into a younger version of Osama Bin Laden and or Hitler? Absolutely not, in fact i'm scared if you think that. Do I think this teaches you anything? No I don't, as a person who values historical accuracy and the preservation of history I do not. The story mode for this game is not accurate and ignores obvious facts at one point they attribute the liberation of a town in Norway to one person they don't mention the resistance fighters who fought for it and died they ignore them, to push their own agenda, not to mention the ninja sword and a woman with a prosthetic hook for a hand in the reveal trailer. Do i think that this game is too violent no, do i think this game is going to make you kid into a psycho like the media is trying to say, no i do not. But i am unhappy with the disrespect of history. So if you son/daughter wants this game by all means let them have it, but mention to them that the war stories are not true and are fake, They should find this game fun though, and you will too if you try it and get good at it. The bad language is really basic and your child is gonna be fine assuming that hes 12 and or 11. Plus he/she has most likely defiantly heard it before in the movies. People i have noticed on this site are over praising this game i suggest buying call of duty world at war if your child has a pc and or ps3 or xbox 360. You can read my review on it when you search up Call of Duty World at War.
Not very much gore, and if you have a good boi named Landon, you should let him play
I have rated this game 15+ for violence and bad language, Violence 4.5/5 you shoot, stab, club and throw grenades to kill enemy players, resulting in puffs of blood as infantry, in vehicles you shoot explosive shots from tanks and can shoot a machine gun, the explosive kills do not have blood or dismemberment but do send people flying, in planes you can drop bombs on people and vehicles but all violence is off screen and you only know that you kill people because of the kill feed. In a cutscene somebody is shot at point blank range with a small puff of blood, you hit somebody's head on a table. Language 5/5 frequent use of f**k and s**t even online, from your character, and one use of c*nt.
Not historically accurate at all. Represents disabled women fighting in America s frontline which we know is inaccurate. It takes away the realism of previous battle fields to make it “politically correct” and not offend SJWs. As a woman I am proud to play as a man because it was them who fought on the frontlines and woman who did the equally important role of healing them, caring for the children, etc. Also , if EA wanted to be politically correct they could have touched on the great female Russian snipers who killed countless nazis and not have put their own spin on the war and still call it accurate.
I have never left a comment before but felt like I had to after reading reviews about this game from other parents who mentioned the language wasn't that bad. Or mentioned this game should be played in a classroom setting?? Just FYI - the cussing is so constant during the game (NOT from other players in chats - the actual game itself) that my almost 12 year old gave me a head's up. It is the F bomb constantly - so much that he even said it was over the top. And the C word. As far as I can tell, there is no option available to limit the language. Just thought everyone might want to know what they're getting into with this game....
