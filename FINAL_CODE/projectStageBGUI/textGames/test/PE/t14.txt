Its a awful game
Rated 15 (sustained threat, psychological horror, violence, strong language).
Its not appropriate for kids what so ever its disgusting an revolting as u beat the life out of creatures and the gameplay is not enjoyable and is just plain broken its not scary its just sick and not in a good way
SEX/NUDITY - None. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are scenes of disturbing horror violence as the player fights grotesque creatures with a variety of weapons. However, these scenes lack the goriest and most graphic detail due to the top-down camera angle and art style. There are also some bloody images and implications of violent incidents. PROFANITY - There is some strong language ("f*ck"), as well as instances of milder terms. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There are plenty of drug references and alcohol references throughout, both visual and verbal. The player is also encouraged to create medicinal drugs for health boosts etc. Although, these are never or rarely used in recreational or stimulating ways, and the game as a whole does not encourage drugs in the real world. THREAT/HORROR - The game contains a constant, sustained sense of threat and menace, made more unsettling and disturbing by the psychological horror elements throughout gameplay. Although being relatively low on explicit gory images, this is still a very intense and surreal experience, with frequent frightening moments which might cause upset to people of a nervous disposition. 15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.
A surprisingly great package!
It includes Bloodlines? Awesomesauce!
After the release of the latest Super Smash Bros, some might ask, "Who is this Simon character?" Now, they can experience the adventures of Simon Belmont and his family in this new collection. While the controls are simple, these games are known for their high difficulty. Luckily, there is a save feature that allows players to save at a hard part in the game and load it again if they mess up. I would recommend newcomers to start off with the fourth game, as it is much more balanced in terms of difficulty. As for inappropriate content, there are some blood and plenty of scary monsters, some being topless women, but nothing too graphic. I highly recommend this collection, as it contains some of the best games ever made!
All the core titles up until Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night (which are best experienced in the Dracula X Chronicles collection on PSP) makes this a good deal. Also, Simon's Quest is rather notorious for a number of quirks (as a certain Mr. Rolfe explained at length) and people might want to look up one of the rom-hacks that correct the issues for a more enjoyable experience. Being based on classic monster movies, there's plenty of horror elements that might disturb kids, even in pixelated form. And the often-overlooked Bloodlines includes actual historical references (World War I, Elizabeth Bathory) that might be awkward for parents to have to explain to kids.
Violent but Heartining
While the game can be violent at times, overall the characters are children trying to survive in horrific circumstances but they are adapting to protect each other. They are good role models and there is no moral ambiguity.
Polished and unique shooter mired by over the top language & sub par overworld.
Its great
Great Game! Parents please read! This game is ok for Tweens and kids of older age!
The team who made Doom created this world which will give you an idea what to exspect from the shooting mechanics as it is a copy and paste kind of scenario from that game to this at it's core. The story and cinematics are cartoonish and almost laughably generic, but the basic gameplay is fun enough with some tagged on gear management, upgrades and some special abilities to aquire like a super melee and ground pound. Vehicles, an open world and racing are thrown in as well to make it a varied adventure, but the shooting parts seem to be where you prepare yourself for while these other elements sometimes feel like fluff to get to the good stuff of "killing baddies". The pace can be sluggish as you traverse the world and perform tasks for leveling, but the unique gear you can receive and build makes for an interesting, if not slow way to be more involved in the preparation process to take on new challenges, which can most often be done in whatever order you choose once you get some tasks under your belt. Survivability in this game can be frustrating as there is no health or shield regeneration and you must either carry very limited supplies or gain health pickups from the environment or fallen enemies, the latter of which disappear after a short period. The good is that you can take the game at your own pace, the bad is that the overworld map is not very user friendly or clear and you will find yourself trying often to discern what to do next, and this problem persists even moreso in the towns you visit as there are no real indicators as to what's what and you are left on your own to figure most of it out yourself. So, hence the mixed reviews, the tone of the game is kindof all over the place with a mish mosh of different settings, towns, activities etc, but this is not just a shooter as there will be quite a bit to accomplish between gunplay levels. Considering all this, the language in this game is often overtly sexual and and as gutter mouthed as it gets. Especially with the over the top weapons you can aquire later on can be enticing for younger players to want to pick this up (being one of the major advertised selling points), but they will be exsposed to the filthiest of language in the process. They can say it's for immersion into the crazy post apocalyptic world, but to this degree seems unecessary. The level of gore is equally unapologetic as well with tons of blood, body parts flying and grotesque sound effects to accomodate it .For the rest, whether or not you can enjoy the tasking and individual aspects like racing and upgrading will very much determine your enjoyment overall, but the DOOM style shooter scenarios are the highlight by far.
My child plays this all the time I think it's great my only problem is the dismemberment
This is a post-apoctolyptic first- person shooter open world video game. It is very fun and colorful, and takes hours to complete. Now for worying parents, lets get to the content of the game. This review that I am giving you is based of the IMBD parent guide for this game. Language- Occasional/infrequent/rare use of the f word semi-frequent use of gd, s***, and what the h*** Violence- this game has the same amount of violence as your average video game, but nothing that is to graphic for starting middle schoolers. You use a boomerang like weapon called the wingstick. Some blood spray, but nor over the top, and not really any gore. Sexual content-There is one scene in the game with people in their underwear, but it has do do with the culture of the characters shown in the scene, and isn't exactly depicted as sexual, and if you are worried about this, your child will have the ability to skip this scene. I think that the overall content in this game is fine for tweens and up. With the kind of frequent langauge not being strong, and there being a rare use of strong language, and the limited violence, and the skippable underwear scene, this game is a really good choice for parents to buy for their starting middle schoolers.
this game is violent but not as bad as the doom or call of duty games and all the sexual content is just one weird cutscene that you can skip of people in their underwear. theirs no sex or prostitution the gameplay is fun and exciting with tons of creative ways to create destruction. their are enemies that require timing and targeting to defeat bosses. to sum this all up rage 2 is a violent game that requires strategy to complete its open world and you can drive any vehicle and set up traps to defeat your enemies.
this game should not be Rated M
This game is amazing you can turn x ray kill cam off and the only swearing in the game is stuff like s**t I am a christian too and I think anybody who is 9 and up should play this. plus it's a good ww2 learning experience if you don't want your kids hearing stuff like s**t just mute the TV
Amazing
Best Cyberpunk Bartending Action game of the 10's!
It contains smoking and alcohol. Amazing plot lines. Sexual themes but no actual sex. Outside the bar, you can go home and buy furniture, play with your cat and read news.
Its suitable for kids if there not scared of zombies jump scares
Actual parent who owns the game!
Pretty violent game
This game is easily 9 +
Good game, don't recommend to kids below 14
Boring
Extreme language
Not As Violent Commensense Says!
Very good and entertaining game fun to play
Extremely Fun And Entertaining
Painfully Generic
Thrilling Zombie Game With Good Role Models
Fun and Educational!
Great Game for Teens!
Not as Bad as Commonsense Says!
Great game
the game has an interesting story about a biker and im not gonna spoil anything im just saying common sense media should of rated it 9 and up because its not that bad its basically the last of us which is also an amazing zombie game for 9 year olds for 2019 if they want days gone get them the game if there 9 or up but if your kid knows about drugs and they can hear cursing and there under 9 get them it
Ok first off I must say the Christian dad with the two sons Your kids have a wool pulled over your eyes buddy. I’m not that Christian you would say but I can’t stand the lords name took in vain and if you was a true Christian I’m sure you would have heard the GD every five seconds. Yes you all heard me this game takes the lords name every line it seems like there a GD here and GD there it’s so ridiculous!!! Other cussing I could stand but I can’t and won’t listen to this every second a lords name took in vein !! The game physics are awesome totally something like far cry and a zombie game it’s pretty sweet but gosh the gd gets me every time. Can’t stand it and NO you can’t change the language to no cussing. I only wish ! You can change it to like French and stuff but come on The game itself is rated M 17+ just cause there friends parents are idiots and let there kids play games like this shouldn’t mean you should. Btw I have three kids
This game is pretty slow and has violent content and TONS of cursing. If your kid is mature enough not to say extreme curse words, they should be fine. Just a fair warning, there will be a lot influenced by this.
I have four kids at. They are all twelve and love days gone. The game is a lot of fun since i have played it myself when I first saw the rating I said no But after playing it I realised it was a fun game. There is a lot of blood but not a lot of cursing good for twelve year olds.
Days Gone has amazing game play and an alright story. It is however very graphic and I honestly don't understand these parents who say there's barely any blood lmao. Just as long as your kid is mature enough to handle all the gore.
In my opinion this is a boring game despite the long wait for this game.
Days Gone could have been a decent game but the writers seemed to have spent more time trying to cram as many curse words and blasphemies in the game (dialog, quest titles, labels on selectable choices, even swapping one curse word out for another in the subtitles) than work on making the story interesting. In addition, the characters feel like they were taken directly from ‘The Walking Dead’ (Hmm, the main character’s name is almost identical to Negan, he drives a motorcycle and uses a crossbow). Because of this, the story feels like it was written by amateurs who didn’t know how to create something original.
I think that days gone is a appropriate game for kids 10 and up when my kids 10 and 14 both wanted it I hesitated but I saw video And It Wasn't that bad and the main character is a biker and he does things that make him a good person like helping survivors any parent with a kid age 10 and up should get this game!
Very fun and entertaining game
Im going to make it quick this i game is really fun and keeps my kids distracted so I can watch football and this game is a little violent but surprisingly not bloody get this game!
Generic in every way. Days gone provides players with a empty world. Interesting concept poor execution.
Days Gone is a fun game and adults like me can find this game interesting i even found myself once staring at the game for 30 minutes till the dinner alarm went off and there is a little swearing but nothing racist or crude i think every mature kid should have Days Gone
I think this game deserves a 9 and up its fun and educational any parent should give their kid this game if there old enough and this is really entertaining and the character is brave smart and funny in appropriate ways and there is only a tiny bit of cussing i think any parent sould get this game for their kid!
I played this game with my son and we loved it. At first I was skeptical because of the Mature rating but my son is 14 and told me that his friends all were getting Days Gone. The game is about I biked in the zombie apocalypse who is searching for his wife. The games story, is long and fun. It’s a memorable story with memorable characters. The violence though throughout the game isn’t at all bad compared to other zombie games. There’s barely any violent cut- scenes, gore, and even little blood. You handle with a lot of zombies but they barely even shed blood. The profanity on the other hand isn't too bad (mainly damn is used) but can be disabled from the games settings. Once playing a while I checked it out on common sense and to my suppose it said that there was a rape scene. I played the game with my son and the rape scene doesn’t exist. All that happens is men drag a women into a bar but there all laughing. There’s no rape in this game what’s so ever. There’s also no other sexual stuff in the game. Days Gone is a wonderful game for teens and will be enjoyed by many who want a good story and fun game.
I’m a Christian dad of two boys (12 and 14). They love video games and really wanted Day Gone. Once they told me that it’s a zombie game, I decided to let them get it and see how bad it was. At first I didn’t really know what to expect but when I started to watch my sons I was surprised by how good it was. The game is about a biker in the apocalypse searching for his lost wife. Days Gone has a story that will take the player on a fun and memorable adventure. I enjoyed playing with my sons for a few hours. Decon, the protagonist is a really well done character and fun to play as. Days Gone is a zombie game though so there’s lots of zombie bashing but I was very surprised by how little blood and gore there was. Zombie games usually have lots of gore but this one lacks even blood. Now, the profanity in the game is frequent but can be disabled in the settings. After playing with my sons for a while I decided that the game was ok for them. It is an amazing game for teens. The game does have one mission though where you get drugs for a character but there prescription drugs. Another thing to mention is that the so called rape scene is nothing like rape. Some men are dragging a women into a bar, but the women is laughing with the men. Not even the dirtiest minds would think of this as rape. Overall, Days Gone is an amazing and wonderful game for teens who want a great story and hours of fun.
This game has some violent scenes but I think that it should be fine for 13 year olds. As a parent of 2 children my 14 year old loves this game and really recommends this game.
