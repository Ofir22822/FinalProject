Best Fantasy Game Of 2019
Not bad...
A great fantasy game full of things to do so much detail lie if you spend time with you're companions you can get to have a boy or girl friend Like racism Natives are called savages, Th?l?me a religion group kill those who don't renounce there gods and they will sometimes will convert people to there beliefs by force You can explore The Island so many monsters and each place has a cast of charters all of them different and in there own way you will need to upgrade to you're friends gear to have a better chance of victory in battle with foes and enemies you can upgrade youre weapons you can be fighter or gunman or wizard Do want to be Good Or Evil Side with any faction But remember actions have consequences if youre like if you do bad things to one faction one of you're companions will leave you and become Foes For instance you want to be a native warrior or priest of Theleme Its you're story Welcome To Greed Fall
A game set in a fantasy world where you play an important role in the land, your choices can effect your storyline. I wouldn't say you could be a bad person in this game but it depends on your own opinion. Yes there is romance options though they don't go indeph, nothing more than kissing and a black screen that fades in after. There's abit of blood with the combat but most of the time you are fighting enemies or fantasy creatures.
Noice
The game has a living, breathing, ecosystem that immerses you into the fictional world of the New World. Great bosses, weapons, and armor.
They do foul each other
PARENTS NEED TO STOP
Stinky and pay to win.

What you should know about NBA2K20
Fun game but has language
Perfect for anyone
nothing bad but they show lots of brands like jordan
Parrents always think this game is bad but instead there the worst. This the best
Such a good game I have it on my switch I love it no violence or Drugs or anything bad really. Awesome game but I suggest 6+ not because it's bad just because it is a little hard to play.
I love the gameplay and all game modes. what ruins it for me is the pay to win. It is so bad. if you love basketball feel free to get this game. Just be prepared to get your cheeks clapped by rich bois that spend hundreds of dollars to get more and more and more.
So I don’t think anything is wrong with this game at all but here are some info. There are brands like Air Jordan’s , Nike, and Gatorade in this game. But I’ll be honest, who cares. There isn’t anything bad in this game besides of some uses of d-mn in my career. But here is something I should point out. Beware of searching images on 2k. Because you might see stuff you don’t want little kids seeing, trust me.
I like this game and all, but they really need to stop with the VC, you have to pay not 50 cents, not 5 dollars, not 10, not 50, but 100 DOLLARS for virtual money! why would I pay real money just for a Virtual pixelated Galaxy Opal Lebron James card on MyTeam? You need PS Plus or Xbox Live Gold (PS plus for me) to play on park (Squad, Cages, Pro Am, REC center, Ante Up, etc.) only to lose a game to a bunch of people with ugly faces and stupid googly glasses, and its all Ronnie 2k's fault too. And be careful in parks because the chat is unmoderated and people can just say cuss words, not like I care though.
This is my first common sense media review. This game is fun but its kinda pay to win in some aspects.
It maybe hard to play for some people but not to everyone this game is basically for everyone
This game is a HUGE step up from 2k19 and a great game overall. Only thing putting it at a 4 is the microtransactions in which they are a little excessive.
Best basketball game ever Fun to play
A great game with a great message.......If you like basketball you will like this game 10/10 only downside is online gaming. Be careful with that.
It's a great game if you like sports, especially basketball, it is pay to win, even though you get paid, but you get paid poorly. The game has some glitches, like the jerseys getting distorted on the players in the lineup introductions.
NBA 2K20 is what you expect. A basic fun game whether you play with friends or not. There are different gamemodes to choose from such as MyTeam (unlock your favorite NBA players and put them on a team together). And MyCarrer (create your own character and go through a narrative as you improve your character). My only problem with this game is there micro transactions. It's far too similar to gambling, and ruins the experience for those who don't pay money for a game they already paid for. No violence, sex, drugs, and hardly any language. All ages game.
I got this game a few weeks ago, and it's one of my favorite games i've played. But a warning before you consider getting it, it is very addicting, and you, or your kid might not be able to stop playing. Maybe it was just for me, but they keep you wanting to play one more games, game after game after game. Otherwise, it is a great game that I highly recommend getting. It is rather hard to play, due to learning all the controls and buttons to push at the right time. But with some getting used to the controls, you'll have a blast playing it, with your friends, or by yourself. There is online play, and if you don't want your kid playing online, than there is lots of other options to play. You can be a team manager, and make decisions for your team, or build your own team of players, then using them on the court. Or there is a my career mode, where you create your own character, then use him in a story line created by the game, and make decisions along the way while playing as him. No violence, inappropriate stuff, or bad language is imputed into the game, I'm not sure if other online players can talk to you, but not playing online there is nothing bad to worry about. I highly suggest this game for kids 8 and up due to the skill level to play, and the adult like content.
It's really a fun game, easy to start and challenging to get good at. The gameplay is good, and a lot of though is giving into rating players. The story mode is emotional and deep, and tells the story of your player. Watch out, though, as dialogue contains language such as hell, d*mn, and Jes*s. Additionally language comes in background hip-hop music which is unedited, mostly language that I have already mentioned and sh*t. There is gambling, but no one is actually going to play it including your kids.
This game is literally just basketball and if you think that a child who is any where from 6-10 shouldn’t play it, than you probably shouldn’t let them play basketball in real life.
A fun game for basketball lovers
Simulated gambling and stole my 2 brothers
Game contains real gambling
The gambling is only if you're really into it, and its hard to find. But my little brother loves this game and its a great bonding time too.
So this game stole my brothers, and now this is the only game they play on their PS4 (along with Horizon, for 1 brother and Fifa 20 for the other). There is limitless simulated gambling. I have rated it not for kids but it should be not for anyone.
This game encourages players to spend real money on gambling to recieve i-game intems. Avoid this game at all costs! Do not support this game or EA will continue to put these gambling mechanics in their games.
good game
good shooter
Blood/swearing can be disabled
Good game
Violent however can be turned off
Good game
very good game not bad for young teens
blood and gore is disabled for me and its really fun, you can also get halo skins and terminator movie skins.
Amazing cover based shooter with fun gameplay. and before you go "oh but its super bloody though", actually one of the first things that come up when you start the game is the option to turn off swearing and gore. and with that off there is literally no gore at all.
It’s a great game, just some blood and swearing. You can turn off mature content, gore, and most of the language in options, and that improves the game a lot. I only turned off mature content and language, you don’t really need to for the gore.
I've been playing the gears of war franchise for over 3 years now and what I've noticed in it is that there is a setting where you can turn off the blood/gore, cussing, adult content, etc. So if you are thinking about getting the game make sure you have a talk before you let them sit down and play!
Very good game it is very bloody
Good for fans
Nice but there is a problem
Good game play, good visuals, amazing music, and tons of references. It's also pretty generous and if you think you need to pay for gem apples you must be REALLY bad at this game.
Really good family game you can play up to 4 players.
The game offers Bloodless Kirby combat as expected. The micro trasactions are not required as the apples are rewarded for doing simple things like using the games stickers also the game is free as in you didn't have to pay the micro trasactions are the only way the game makes money the problem is you have to wait to get vigor back
okay game, for 9- 11
Great fantasy RPG, but not for under 13
torchlight 2-the paragraph
Very fun.
a great game
My two cents on Torchlight II.
went overboard on the blood and gore
Great game, a little to bloody
this game can be pretty bloody and gory, but the age rating goes down to 10 or 11 after you turn of the blood, which you can do in the settings. if it is still is to violent, consider getting your child fate, which is nowhere near as violent as any other rpg's like torchlight 2.
Alright, this should be easy. Torchlight II is a fantasy RPG that involves defeating monsters to complete quests. However, right from the start, there is violence only to achieve a small thing. If you like those two things, you can ignore the rest of this. If you're a concerned parent, please keep reading. Due to the heavy violence, some parents might not want their kids (or themselves) to play it, and blood and gore are a crucial part of that experience. The developers have responded to the many (angry) reviews about the violence, so there is an option to disable blood and gore in the Options menu. This greatly improved the amount of younger players on Torchlight II, and many parents are happy with that. In summary, if you like achievement adventure, Torchlight II is for you.
This game can be challenging and frustrating but it can also be fun and satisfying. Not to mention the variety of classes and pets. And also it is 3-d.
This is a very fun game the only bad thing about it is the fact that when you get very close to an enemy and critical hit them they explode into blood and guts.
torchlight 2 is a great adventure game! lots of content! if your not the type for the blood and guts there is an option in the settings to turn it off. i did find that it does NOT turn off purple goo or squished green spiders.
Torchlight II is an incredibly fun and easy-to-play dungeon-crawler type game that I recommend for ages 9 and up. Although it has blood and gore by default, in the options screen, you can easily turn it off. There is no sexual content, no swearing, no drinking, and it's quite easy to play and fun. It has some pretty cool and lovable characters, and I really recommend it for anyone who loves adventuring!
the only reason that i think its for older kids is the blood and gore other than that its a great you can explore and fight off monsters and get cool weapons!!! you can turn off the blood and gore in settings then it would make it a 10 and under so worth the 20$ awesome!!!
A amazing game overall, diffenitly worth the $20. the blood is incredibly frequant and you fight humenoid (and occasionally human) enemys. though the blood can be turned off. you can play on public games, so you never know what you will come across in those.
Amazing game with a deep story
This game does touch on subjects that could make some people think twice, but I assure you that this game does not go to deep into anything bad and treats all of the subjects it covers seriously. I played this game when I was thirteen and had no problems with anything. This game has no blood and has a variety of difficulties for younger audiences. A mature 9 or 10 year old could definitely enjoy this game, but an average 11 year old would love it.
Best horror game
Disappointing
its a good game.
Deeply Intense, Scary
Weird gameplay
I do to want to spoil anything, but the story leaves much to be desired, and answered. It has a depressing storyline, that doesn't make sense, and leaves you with a bad feeling. I am OK with depressing stories, but it has to make sense, and having a reason for being the way it is
its a really fun game, that has some bloood. nothing too voilent.
BLAIR WITCH is an easy gameplay with plenty of foul language. Parents should be cautious about the tension and scariness.
