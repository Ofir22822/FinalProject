One of my favorite games!
Great Game!
Great game
Overwatch=good
Great, fun, simple. PG violence. 12+ for voice chat.
Best game ever my favorite game
This game is great, has a very small amount of blood or anything very bad. CSM has too many parent ratings, so every game that is rated Teen is always for like 37 year olds. Overwatch has tons of great characters, and doesn't really make you buy anything in game. It has merch, yes, do do most video games. There is no profanity or drugs whatsoever, and no I don't think a smoking cowboy is drugs. Another great thing about Overwatch, is just the huge amounts of people that play, so it's also a great way to make online friends(if you do that). The chat on games has never been a problem in my life, most gamers don't bother typing in the chat a lot of the time. Overall, I think Overwatch is a good game, and people should be less harsh.
The game has a bit of violence, including small splatters of blood, and revealing costumes. Good game.
The graphics of this game are phenomenal, exceeding Fortnite, Apex, and most other games in its category. A lot of people on here are saying higher age ratings because it is online and people can talk to you. However, you don’t have to be on game chat( where you can talk to other people) There is very little blood and is very cartoony. The controls are pretty easy once you play around with it for around an hour or so.
The review has 2 rating on sex tell me how a cartoon game is a 14 plus and has sex references.
overwatch is a very good game and i thint it is suitible for children 10+, but if your child is under 12 i reccomend turning in game chat off because there are alot of toxic players who seem to have no limit to the things they say, and the custom games and group finder can also have offensive or obscene titles and also be filled with horny roleplayers. The quickplay and arcade modes are just perfect if your child is under 12 because it is safe just as long as game chat is off, other than that the game is very entertaining and fun, its just the community surrounding it that is bad, and i'm also cherry picking details, it really isn't that bad.
This is the best game I have ever played although there are some chats you don't have to join them
Overwatch is a great game, there is teamwork, it is positive, and it is fun, but you have to be careful about the toxic and mean players. Like many other games, Overwatch has a voice chat option Many people will talk and every once in a while someone will pick up their mic and start to talk. 90% of the time those people won’t say anything mean, bad or toxic, but sometimes, someone will be mean, swear or be toxic. The players can be mean because they died, someone wasn’t being helpful, someone wasn’t good at their character the we’re playing or there team lost. Sometimes these players might leave the game in rage, people refer to people who do this as Rage Quitters. This does make sense because overwatch can be very infuriating but why leave and leave your team at a disadvantage? If too many players leave the match, the match will be cancelled and all the remaining players will be kicked out so why do it?
I play on a daily basis and have over 200 hours in game. There is about as much violence as a lego game, you shoot someone and when they die they fall down and disappear just like playing lego star wars. There is an occasional D*mn when a negative affect is placed on you but it is often in a another language. The game itself promotes team work because if you do not work as a team you cannot push a payload or control a point. It a very high quality game especially for the price compared to games like fortnite which will likely cost you a lot more in the long run overwatch is a one time purchase. If you want to know about sexual content there is a character with some cleavage shown but the game is in first person so if you do play widowmaker you cannot see anything and if equip a new skin you cannot see anything. Tracer also has a skin tight suit but you see more sexual outfits on the street. Overwatch is a game you can work together with your family and friends it is a great bonding opportunity and a very light T and way closer to a E 10+.
Honestly besides fortnite this is the most kidfreindly fps i have ever played there is no blood no swearing by the characters the worst things characters do is kill each other (but thats the point of the game duh) and one character smokes a cigar. If i had a kid i would defenetly let them play this game
Of corse it is a fighting game, but it has as much violence as Fortnite (RIP). One character is smoking a cigar in the name of drugs. Their is no Sex, I have no idea why that is in the rating. But it requires Nintendo online if your playing on Switch.
I've been playing this game for 2 years and I have not seen anything that makes this game too inappropriate. Some characters ex.( Widowmaker, Mercy, symmetra) wear revealing and tight suits but no actual nudity is meant in any sexual way. Language never goes far beyond the only word dam* and if you would like to be aware voice lines can be purchased and one of them is the dam* word but its in a different language so no one really feels offended if you speak English. As far as violence gets like the real world shotguns are depicted with a character called reaper but They sound unrealistic. Also occasionally in a game if you use melee like a punch blood will be shown but again very unrealistic. As the game quickly unfolds to players teamwork and cooperation seem the only way to win. Online players these days aren't very toxic anymore. I haven't been in many games where the foul- mouthed adult will say much. Mostly kids will be in the chat and if language does occur just mute them in social settings. So that way the fun goes on. I recommend this game to anyone who loves action and sci fi and playing with friends. In game purchases make your account better so just know this before any purchased come at surprising moments. One of the best games ever. Hope you enjoy!!!
should be 'e' for everyone I don't know why common sense media rates it as 14+. Plus the open mic can be disabled so people on your child's team can't hear your child and your child can't hear them when that feature is enabled.
Absolutely wonderful game that is still going strong after four years of release. The only downside to this game is the comms. As other reviews have said, they can be turned off, but because of that you will never know when to push or if anyone is flanking from behind. They are absolutely necessary if you want to succeed in this game. A good thing is that you can individually mute players so if someone isn't contributing and just spouting trash about you can mute them.
Overwatch is a great game, with great characters. I've loved the game ever since I got it, and even though I'm not very good at it, I play it for hours. It takes place in the future, so the guns aren't based off of any real guns, and you can barely see any blood, and even when you do it looks fake. The violence isn't a lot, and the characters are heroes who try to defeat evil. It's a great and fun game, and I prefer it for 8 and up.
Having invested hundreds of hours in the game, I can honestly say it is a fantastic game. There is minimal to no blood(and even then it’s sometimes blue), no sexual situations, and pretty much no swearing (aside from a Wild West characters optional voice line that includes the word ‘h-ll’). The game is only online 6v6 multiplayer, so if you don’t feel comfortable with your child playing online sadly there is no offline. You can disable game chat though so your child wouldn’t be able to talk to their team. Overwatch is a strategic, team building, cooperative game with a competitive side, and is for sure my favorite game. 20/10
The game I will be reviewing today is Overwatch, a first person shooter game made by Blizzard. In this game it is a 6 vs 6 in a random map, there 31 unique characters you can play as. There are 3 modes, payload where a cart needs to be escorted, capture point where there are 2 points you need to claim/defend, and finally control point where there is 1 point and you have to control it for a set amount of time. This game’s cost varies, I bought it when it costed $60 back in 2017. Now it cost $20 for classic $40 for origins and $60 for legendary, the more costly versions just give you more cosmetics but is the same game, and are not worth the extra money. The game has a wide player base, and lots of people spend hours upon hours on this game. Some characters take no skill to play but wreck everyone like Baston, Mei, Torbj?rn, Sombra, Symetra, Reaper, Widowmaker, Sigma, Moria and Baptist. Overall I think overwatch is a great game and you can play on computers or on consoles. You can connect with people from any device and you get the same exact match. It is a great game and now only the low cost of $20. When overwatch 2 was announced I read about it for a while and it can still play with people from overwatch 1 on the same server, speed, and gameplay. 9/10 would recommend.
This is probably one of the best games of all time. There is no sex, if you don’t give your kid a mic, then he/she can’t talk to other people. McCree, a cowboy character does occasionally have a cigar in his mouth, but he never vocally promotes it. Some of the characters Occasionally say the words “dammit” or “what the hell”, but i play this game a lot and have only heard it a couple of times. As for the “blood” when you are on really low health a red ring appears on the edges of your screen to notify you that your on low health and the blood is nonexistent if no one had told me there was blood I honestly would have never noticed. Most of the characters are not only heroes, but promote heroism. One of the characters is literally a hamster in a giant robot hamster ball. A couple of the hero’s are lgbt. This game is so much more kid friendly then call of duty or any other famously violent game. This game promotes team based skills, helps reaction times. Before I mentioned some of the characters are heroes, for example Winston, a genetically modified super smart gorilla. But some of them are bad. For example Roadhog and Junkrat, two Australian guys who went mad after the Omnic crisis in Australia. Most of the gun are not real life guns. I think only 2 out of the 31 heroes have realistic guns, and ones a sniper and the other is a soilder. That’s probably why they are realistic. Most of the characters are scientists who created weapons life Moira who can shoot beams that heal friendly players, or Zenyatta a philosophical robot that can shoot magic orbs that can help friendly players or worsen enemy players. If your kid asks for this she/he is probably old enough to play it. This is one of the best team based games of all time.
A simple shooter game. Very little blood. While sure, the characters may be revealing, kids wont understand it unless they are old enough. There is voice chat, which is almost required to play competive, but it can be turned off, and I would not reccomend having it on unless your child is 12+. A very simple shooter game for most ages!
This game is clean with some violence it is just fun good for families and I can’t count maccre smoke taboco becouse he is a cowboy
noice

Please Read
Best FPS without gore!
It’s really not bad
i find it fun to play but i cant help but notice i suck. with the mic you can hear alot of swearing. reaper is op though.
Game is great. Fun, interesting. The game has a very low skill floor, and a very high skill ceiling. Many interesting, fun, unique characters to play as. There’s a character with a kit for any play style you can think of. The game is heavily based around a group of heroes, a group of villains, and a couple more neutral groups and characters, but the story revolves mainly around the ideals of heroes. Game has some balancing issues but that’s the only real issue gameplay wise. Biggest problem for younger audiences are the voice coms. The game is very dependant on teamwork and speaking with teamates, but that means you'll lose a whole lot if you’re playing competitive matches if you’re not in chat. This means that you’ll want to be in voice coms, but that also means that you’ll most definitely run into toxic players. Not knowing how to handle these players or being too young could make the game less fun to play, Not much actual swearing in the game, but toxic players certainly bring that to the table. There’s obviously violence because it is a first-person class-based shooter. There’s a few revealing outfits in the game.
I think the game is good... But I don't love it. I think that there is a lot of joy for a lot of people, but it isn't quite for me. But u think it's fine for most kids. It teaches kids teamwork, and doesn't have any gore, just the guns. I think anyone above 8 is allowed to play it, but they probably won't understand it very well until they're around 11-12 years old. But there is loot boxes, which kids might put more money into.
Where to start? This game is a great introduction to shooters. It has intuitive controls, easy-to-grasp abilities, and not much blood. The characters are mostly heroic and respectable, and aside from two (Reaper, who literally relishes the idea of death, and Sombra, who's just a power hungry freak), even the villains can be understood to a degree. I don't think that consumerism should be dialed up to a four, as you only but cosmetics, and unlike Fortnite or other games, your character is appealing and unique-looking without a skin or modification. Also, sex should certainly not be at two. I'm aware some characters are wearing things that aren't eskimo jackets (Oh wait! One character IS wearing an eskimo jacket!), but it seems wrong somehow. Some people bring up the unmonitered chat, but if you use the convenient communication wheel to talk, which has options like "Defend the checkpoint!" or "I need healing!", you could go entire matches without ever popping open the chat window. You can't not look at voice chat, which is uncensored as well, but you can mute it and that's that. The violence really isn't that horrible either, as a very small fraction of the characters have actual firearms. Most have swords, laser guns, giant hammers, small hammers, rocket launchers that are made of car parts, oversized gauntlets that shoot shrapnel, or other bizarre weapons. In other words, if you're okay with your child watching star wars or the chronichles of narnia, this should be okay in terms of violence. There is a cowboy in the game who smokes at all times, but I didn't even notice for the first month of playing the game. This doesn't really fit any catagories, but it should be said that when using their "ultimate" ability, all heroes will shoult out their catchphrase, and it will. Most of these are harmless, silly sayings like "Nerf this!", "It's high noon...", or other simple blips that let everyone know a powerful attack is coming. However, one character, Reaper, screams the word "DIE" repeatedly. You can turn off voice lines to prevent this, but then you can't hear the other ultimates coming and are at a disadvantage.
I’ve played this game since last Christmas, and I love it. I wouldn’t let your kid play it if they are under 10.
The game has almost no violence at all, and is a great game for young kids and adults alike but something you should consider when buying the game is that it can get boring quite quickly well for me at least. Overwatch is basically the same thing over and over again but the skins and the over 30 heros can make that not so boring but i still found it boring when playing. Also a few heros do have bombs and one apears to be crazy which could be associated with drugs and some heros can scare kids like 'road hog' who is big has a mask and tattoos and some other things search it up on google. there is alot to buy in game. there is a also a voice chat. and a normal chat which is only on pc whilst voice chat is on all devices that you can play overwatch on.
Overwatch is a Hero-Based First Person shooter that is fun (if you casually play and don't pog) Community is toxic at times but game is good and fast-paced.
Appropriate game with violence that that is slightly cartoonish. I’ve been playing this game for just over 2 years and have never gotten sick of it. 100% would recommend for anyone who want a game to have fun with but also enjoy a competitive experience. As long as you’re old enough to have an understanding of how to play the game then I recommend you try it out.
It is a great game, the violence in it is quite tame due to the fact that it is cartoon characters. The only thing I have to say is there is a bit of blood. I first discovered this when I shot a character in slow motion and saw the blood fly off their head. Also there's a few characters in this game that have quite revealing outfits. such as the character called Widow Maker, you can see her butt in the battle field. and another character called Tracer doesn't leave much to the imagination. So you must have a chat with your child about this, but really you don't notice it too much, although that doesn't mean it is ok.
Play Fortnite or Minecraft... maybe even Roblox! Just don't even bother with this game, it is horrible
There is sexy outfits for some female characters and the violence is pretty futrisitic so it is apropriate for kids who like action games
Overwatch is good game, but Paladins is still better. Violence is the main factor. Animated blood appears but is sometimes hidden during the colourful battles and fast paced shootouts. Some characters wear "thicc" outfits and some revealing. The community sometimes comes up with theories and characters lore based on sexuality.
The best game I have ever played. While some characters will say d*mn when they take damage it is fine as long as your kid knows not to cuss. very cartoony violence with minimum blood. There is a character that smokes a cigar and there is beer and wine located around the map there is no bad thing to do with drugs. While some voicelines/sprays are not the best (The noose spray and reaper's voiceline, DIE DIE DIE) they are not very bad. some female characters are animated a little.... weird. Most character are nice and this is a great team building game. The Competitive mode should be played by older kids because it takes a lot of strategy and skill, the voice chat is mostly adults cussing, and people get really mad when they have a kid on their team. Great game overall. PS I put to much drugs and too much violence because there was no milder option
There is some blood that is quite unnoticable from some characters, it appears as a small splash of red. One character is also seen with a cigarette in his mouth and one character is wearing some clothing that may be considered revealing. Nothing too graphic great shooter for younger kids who want to start playing FPS games. There is an option to spend money in-game on crates and it can be quite rewarding sometimes.
How is this 13 up! First of all there is a little bit of violence but nothing compared to the Halo games. You buy it first and you have it forever until your console breaks down and no swearing at all (Apart from trash talkers but you can mute people so that is not a problem) No sex, No drugs apart from a Cowboy with a tobacco but that is nothing compared to the GTA games drugs,sex,swearing and themes. I reckon just Blizzard are just good and the game is nothing bad.
Overwatch is a shooting game. Know that now. It costs maybe 40 dollars, (Origins?), but it has in-game purchases (loot-boxes, mostly.) which unlock cosmetics like skins for characters. Pay to play. Chat, both voice and text is largely unmonitored. General chat is an open zone, a lot of (for some reason alt-right vocabulary?) and slurs. Voice chat has the opportunity to be tame, but once you go towards Competitive levels of play (level 35ish and up) Voice can be hostile. Wouldn't rec for younger children. Best bet is 14-15+. No blood. Minor references to smoking. Promotes team play. If you have a particularly immature child, disable purchases / voice chat. Very fun.
i think at first you should limit your kid if they start going overboard but video games are a place for getting away from you duties and oblagations a place to relax
It is a really good game, YOU CAN LOCK VOICE COMMUNICATION WITH PARENT CONTROLS, so you kids don’t listen to 25 year olds who don’t have a job, there is no nutity or drugs or anything bad, honistly, it’s like a Disney game with guns that 1/2 the time don’t exist and positive role models, and sayings that your child can listen to THERE IS NO CUSSING AT ALL!!! I think parents think that there is blood but there is not and you are killing BOTS NOT REAL PEOPLE COMMON SENSE MEDIA IS OVER RATING IT!
It's very cartoony and there isn't much blood or gore. It's a really fun game with lots of modes. You can learn a lot about teamwork as well as life lessons from the characters in the official short films.
TURN OF CHAT OPTIONS FOR TEN AND UNDER NOT SUITABLE INTHAY CASE but other than that it’s pretty good for people.
