Not that bad.
I've had this game almost since release and they have just made it better and better. Great starting point for unsure parents about FPS games.
Good.
great game for all ages
BEST GAME EVER PLAYED
Never gets old
Very experienced with this game
Not as good as the ads made it sound like
Great Game
Ok for younger kids
Best game ever
There is nothing wrong with this game except for violence. It is completely unrealistic and about as bad as fortnite. I haven’t seen any revealing outfits yet. As long as you have chat off, this is a kid friendly game.
There's not really any drugs or sex (Except for McCree who holds a cigar) The most family friendly and better than Call of Duty
What an evil Satan game, no kids should ever touch this trash heap. I mean what theheck it has guns!!!!!1. This is why World War III is going to happen. Teaching kids to kill others is just degrading our society. Not to mention the endless bugs they add in disguised as ‘DLC,’ whatever that is. My kids are way more classed than this dump.
I have this game and I play it alot. Overwatch is a multiplayer game that you fight each other in battles of 6v6. The only 2 things you need to know is That some heroes in the game like Reaper say D-mn! when someone is attacking him. The second reason is that widowmaker wears a suit that shows her bo-bs. I hoped this helped you. : )
This game is a pice of crap there are so many better first person shooters out there that are more balanced and more fun.The balancing in the game is horrible Call Of Duty Ghosts is better
some characters have reveling or tight clothing but nothing graphic. one character smokes a cigar. when a character is shot there's little to no blood shown. occasionally characters might say "damn" if they get hit. most characters show good role models. some mature 8 year olds could be allowed to play.
i love this game i like the cartoon y feel but also the fps feel its a real nice game a lot of kids can play this its not close to anything thing real the heroes have different things that there good at and powers etc.. its a great game 5 and up could play
Find a match,have fun.simple as that.
This game is great. I got it when I was like 12 or 13 I think and I've been playing it since. It promotes teamplay and cooperation, and the underlying theme behind all of the heroes' reasons for fighting is to "protect the innocent," as one character even says. Overwatch is a 6 v 6 teambased first person shooter where the goal is to capture an opjective, not just to slaughter the other team. The controls are easy to get the hang of, but some characters are significantly more difficult to master for younger players. Younger children should be wary of the voice chat in competitive matches, where swearing and other toxicity lurk. However, there is always the option of turning it off. Great first shooter for new gamers!
This game is very fun and unique. As far as blood, there's very little and its very unnoticeable. Cursing is nothing more than c*ap or d*mn and its not overused. One of the things that makes this game so cool is the characters. They each have their own abilities that make them different from others, and it lets players find a character that's right for them. Most of these characters are great role models, and are against crime and fight for good. It might teach teach kids that sometimes, you have to risk your own life for someone else. For example: in one of the characters backstories (Tracer) an innocent person is about to get assassinated. Tracer notices the sniper on top of a building and jumps in front of the bullet. After a long battle to stop the assassin, a young girl nearby witnesses the battle and is inspired by the brave act that she took. This game is a great game and I feel like its a good one to start out with if your kid wants a shooter game.
Best kid friendly shooter i guess but it is a bit danger with the freechat and some people was ok it has in app purchases with the lootboxes for skins its a good game
easy to play with some characters, some are for more experienced players. there are guns but no blood and that is literally all there is to it
My mum thinks overwatch is violent, but i can say if my mom let me id give it 2 and up.
Overwatch is a great game and in my opinion has no aspects that a parent wants their child to avoid. The style of the game is cartoony and it includes no blood whatsoever except for when you are on very low health and a red outline appears on your screen. There are multiple characters to choose from and you start with them all at the beginning of the game. Each has exclusive abilities and appearances. The only reason I am rating it a 10 plus is because it is an online game and there are options to message and voice chat. Even grown ups will find this game amusing as you can either play it simply or look at it as a strategic, team based game. You can play a death match (all V all)
Played this game for 8 months and can tell you that the age rating is spot on the box or if a mature 10-11 year old could also play. Violence is very cartoon and no blood or gore. Sexual characters is only one but you can purchase a skin for 1000 credits to get rid of the cleverage so recommend doing that but a big factor was that I spent 80 euro on dlc in this game buying loot boxes so don’t buy dlc. Swearing is almost non igsisint but when a character Called zenatta puts his damage orb on a character the use the word damn other than that no swearing. This game has lots of positive messages and role models because some of the voice lines can be very incouraging. Competitive mode: Overwatvh has a very triggering competitive mode where u are expected to try hard or try your best which can result in destructin of property or your child might get very angry. Another thing is voice chat voice chat is where you talk to strangers in ur game this can be bad because the use of language can be a very strong issue so don’t let them join voice chat. Talking to your friends while playing though is one of the funniest times in my life “mending “ with your friends is hilarious. 100 percent worth buying just think if ur child is able or mature anough to play it. Have fun and stay safe
Huge disappointment when it was suddenly just a dull and boring game instead of a ground-breaking, mind-blowing game that I was expecting. it was just a game with boring gameplay. At least this is still better than TF2 or Cs--Go
Great game. Don't think it should be 13+.
This Game is good for kids 9 and up, just make sure you go to the settings for the game, select audio, and turn off the voice chat. Mainly in Competitive mode, (but this can happen in all modes) there is lots of people screaming swear words at each other on voice chat. Some say that In game modes like Competitive you need voice chat, but i'm a Diamond Ranked player (a little over mid teir) who never uses voice chat and I do just fine. This game has a little bit of blood that splatters when you attack, but it is a very small amount of blood that often goes unnoticed. As long as you have your kid turn off voice chat, the game should be fine for your kid.
I do warn you, there are a lot of feminist in this game, big big butts and some people fantasize the characters and I do not recommend searching them, TOO MANY INAPPROPRIATE language speaking and screaming or screeching and the worst part is that kids are swearing and screaming for unknown reasons because their team is bad. I recommend reporting them immediately if you do not like them screaming at you also mute them and don't tell them you reported them for that kind of behaviour otherwise they'll salt report you back but the game itself did something about it to stop those kind of abuse but and some people hates everything here and the game is sometimes full of hackers with protesting. If you're gonna buy the game then be sure to be alert by my message who is gonna buy the game. The game is #1 unique. Has good background and graphics, great gameplay, nice storyline, nice pvp mode and custom mode created by players and the game is challenging, and a good distraction if you have nothing to do and for your children to enjoy a videogame so they can leave you alone or if they have nothing to do or if they did a good job on something. Strong messages are wars and stuff like starwars but will never happen. The characters are sexualized but younger players will never notice, easy to play, too much violence and children might think that explosions, guns and other weapons that can kill you does not kill you in real life, too many fantasizing and otherwise called sexualizing, the online players swears, if you loved the game then you're gonna be one of those people who collects Overwatch items and stuff, the hero named "McCree" always smokes cigarette and the characters will sometimes speak like they've been drinking too much except the 19 year old "D.Va", Tracer, Winston and the omnics heroes, and people should read the rules and regulations before playing this to not get banned also some people will sneak into your Overwatch account also blizzard etc and will spam you invites unless you block them and then message you mean, mean things after a match is over and you still have to block them ingame and your ps4/blizzard account to prevent them from harassing you.
10+
great game
Warning about teams/competitive
Great Shooter for young kids!
If your kid is mature
Awesome Shooter With Little To No Violence.
Overwatch is awsome
Great shooter with some minor things to worry about
Likely the most kid friendly shooter game.
gets stale after a while
A GREAT WELL ROUNDED GAME
Toxic game needs to be more realistic like Roblox ... XD
My favorite first person shooter.
Good game
Overwatch... not that bad!
Honestly....
Frequent mild cartoony violence , ok for 11+
Incredibly fun, Relatively nonviolent and with a more lighthearted tone than many fps games
it should be rated 10+ because there is barely any blood.
Overwatch is a great game overall - but if you are a parent worried about too much violence or something, you don't have to worry! This game has almost no blood at all. (Except for a little bit comes out when you hit someone.) Mostly, it's all about saving the world and building up your reputation as heroes. If I was a parent, I would only worry about my child's safety. There is team voice communication but, for Xbox users you can disable it in the Overwatch menus or on the Xbox account itself. I'm not sure about PlayStation
this game has to be one of the best iv'e ever played with more than 20 characters and so many cool maps. there is blood in the game but its very dificult to notice while playing. there are some characters that do look a bit innapropriate but the only one that goes over the top is a character call widowmaker. there is online interactivity which means there will be people swearing but there is a way to fix this just turn you're volume down when you're in a game when someone is using a mic. there is only one drug use part really and thats a cigar that a character called mcree smokes but it really dosen't matter that much.
team chat can get pretty vulgar and abusive. Be be aware of this before considerign joing team chat.
This is a great shooter for your kids who want something such as Call of Duty but you will not allow them. No Blood or Limbs coming off or anything like that but there is an unmoderated chat, especially for PC so what your kids will hear will not always be the best. Other than that, it is a Colorful shooter for young kids especially
The game is slightly violent but it's cartoonish and unrealistic, I'd say if your kid is mature enough and at least 9 years old buy it for them. However keep in mind it's and addicting game so they might get somewhat obsessed with it.
It's pretty fun to play the arcade modes and play quick play. Overall in this game, there isn't really much to cover apart from it being a really fun shooter with no blood, gore etc. There is online microphone use, which can be muted, but people can say swear words and other things on their mic; the most commonly known thing I've heard people say to others in their mic is that they are terrible at the game etc., but overall great shooter. It can be played anywhere from 9 and up if your kid is mature enough to mute people who try to talk bad about them.
Definitly let your kids play this exept for minor blood and cussing this game is more appropiate that other first person shooters play it all the it is awesome best game one earth.
great game IMO things to worry about though: there is very little blood when you get a good shot on other players but there is no gore, i recommend you child to be 14+ for voice chat as there is a lot of swearing, there is very little smoking but is fine, also do not be surprised if your kid is coming to you to ask you for loot boxes.
Overwatch is one of the best games I have ever played. I rate this game 10+ because of the lack of blood, profanity, etc (basically anything a parent would worry about). Though one character, Widowmaker, wears a revealing outfit, and McCree is always shown smoking, they don't effect the game in any way, except for some dialogue about McCree's smoking habits. There is a minuscule amount of profanity. The only "bad" thing any of them say is "damn" but it's always in another language, form what I have heard. There is voice chat in Overwatch. You can turn it off, however, it is essential to winning matches, for Overwatch is a team based game. Players can be very toxic, especially in competitive, and often threaten to false-report, and tell people to "kys" if they're doing bad. This has happened to me several times, because I am very terrible at this game, and get accused for "trolling" often. Overall, this game is no worse than something like Minecraft or Terraria. Overwatch promotes heroism, and doing the right thing, and I would suggest this to mature children.
the whole game is based off of killing characters on the opposite team.
Overwatch is a great game I’ve played tonnes of it and it’s great fun but common sense media why 13+ this game is not violent at all compared to many other FPS games and it’s great fun
it is not that violent i mean their are more kid friendly games like garden warfare 2 but only a little splash of blood so its also relay good with a wide range of characters and its bright colors so it is a realy good game
RrEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! get good m8.. also you should play CSGO OR PUBG INSTEAD FOR MORE TOXICiTTY!
Some of the characters have inspiring backstories like Lucio, but other characters are criminals. Overall there is little blood and little swearing. And the blood is a just quick flash of red. Since the blood is just a quick flash of red, younger kids can play it if red doesn't bother them. It is easy to play and super fun. The graphic are really good. Overall it is just a great game.
Its a fun game!
Some people say, 2+. NO VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER!!! Some people say, 16+. TOO VIOLENT!!! SHOULD BE M!!! TOXIC PLAYERS!!! DON't BUY!!! I think that if you merged these reviews, then this is what Overwatch is. It is not very violent. The only blood is a red splash when someone dies, and the players fall down and then re spawn when killed, similar to Minecraft. There are objectives, and the players usually aren't toxic at all. If there was an E-11+ rating, I would slip Overwatch under that category. It is not really an E-10 game, but I would say it is completely OK for Ages 10 and up. One of the problems with this game is that you need a really good computer to run it. I have a Dell XPS 15 9560 with a GTX 1050 and an Intel Core I5, and I still have to use medium graphics (Probably cause of 8GB ram.) Great game, however. Most of the characters are great role models, fighting for their countries or whatnot. Some of the only non-good role models are for example, The Reaper, who just says "die" and stuff like that, and is portrayed is a terrorist. That is the worst, though. There is no wonder how it won Game of The Year in 2016. Be careful with the consumerism, however, with any big game like this one there is lots.
You might think it's violent,but it's just as violent as a pg-rated marvel movie. There isn't strong suggestive themes which parents have to worry about.
This game has low violence that is mostly cartoony, there is little to no blood and the only thing close to a swear word is "damn" which I've only heard four times after 49 hours of playing this game, you can also mute in game voice chat so your younger kids don't have to hear people swear or say inappropriate jokes. Overall this game is excellent and if your worried this is too violent for your child its not, just talk to them about the game after they play it and about the difference with video games and real life.
I honestly think that this is a good game for most ages. It has minimal blood, no language, and in all honesty, has a far more optimistic feel than most fps games. Overall excellent game.
