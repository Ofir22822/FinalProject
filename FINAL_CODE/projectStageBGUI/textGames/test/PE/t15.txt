Progress Your Faith
Before a proper review, let me say this game is a reasonable hack-n-slash for 13+. Mostly a hum-drum RPG with the classic, single-player mechanics and elements of a third-person fighter. If you're looking for outstanding gameplay or graphics, this is not your stop. If you're looking for thought-provoking story and might want to let your kids start questioning, wrestling with faith in a more controlled way... Dragon's Dogma, in both iterations, is very much a Japanese game at heart. The story and the reason for the character's journey are heavily centered around purpose. Your heart is stolen by the titular Dragon. You are removed from humanity and fated never to die, save by battle. Now apart, the purpose for which the character sets out is to recover their heart, their humanity, and understand why the Dragon chose them. (Spoilers Ahead) What the story resolves into is a statement about the difference between those that simply flow along and those who seek to understand their reason for being, and perhaps even exert influence (their will) over that existence. Upon reaching the Dragon, the character is offered an admittedly hamfisted choice: betray your most beloved for fame, fortune, and renown, or challenge the Dragon to reclaim your heart and truly break your shackles. If one chooses to fight the Dragon, and defeats him, they are rewarded with their heart and a little hint. Seek the truth at the world's utmost depths. The full, true journey sees the character standing before a sit-in for God, asked if they will take on the burden of being a battery for Creation. Not God Himself, but an energy source to keep his work alive. Why this has been set in place is never explained. However, the underlying message is clear: Do not simply sit and flow along and accept, but question and challenge and understand. Faith is not a matter of being spoon-fed; this is why God gave us free will. We are to question, to wrestle, and to seek any other perspective we can. That is the message of this game, in its own strange, keenly Japanese delivery. This site, as usual, has not done justice in their short-sighted review. If you're going to review something, perhaps understand it first?
Mortal Kombat 11 review
For anyone who says, "it is not real, it's just game." Then what is the point of a parent guide? Lol Just let your kids watch anything, because "IT'S NOT REAL" right?
Less in your face but still very fun. Story and the aftermath Story are both very good.
Anyone can play this game
Pretty violent game
DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR KIDS!
17 years old or older is recommended
Gory
I’m am surprised
Greatest Mortal Kombat since Deception & MK3
Disappointed of the Change
Horrifyingly gory
feminist
Over the top, campy fun is not for little kids.
This game would be rated T if it wasn't for the fatalities.
Excellent Game, Heavy on Violence
I think Mortal Kombat 11 is a Orval great game some things you might be concerned about is how extreme is this game I’m not going to lie there is gore theres not much profanity what so ever. I would say gore is what gives this game a M rating . If you play the game you pretty much have a choice if you want to go try hard or just play the worst thing in the game is doing a Fatality but the thing about doing a fatality Is it’s really hard to do and it take practice if I kid plays the game there not going to be able to do a fatality it’s really complex and with out fatality’s this game is a T related game I think the right age to play is 12/13 + because this game is not that bad trust me on that I let my 13 and 14 year old sons play this game I sat right next to them for a good amount of time to see what the game is really about I’ve even played it myself for a little while if you think this game is to Extreme Then maybe reconsider that choice if they just play the story mode and just play the game and not do fatalities every second they will be fine
All Mortal Kombat games are fun. Though these newer mortal kombat brutal fatal kills now, I feel like are less brutal than the older games of this franchise. Because the finishing moves are so over the top gory that it's kinda ridiculous. I feel like the grittiness is gone. Don't get me wrong, the gore is still gross, it's just more silly now. Like I said, the finishing moves are so unrealistic BUT I am still gonna rate this 18+ for just the amount violence.
The content in this game is very violent which is the basis of every game in the series except Mk vs dc universe. The violence is extremely bloody and gory to the point where it could be sickening for some and shocking/scary. The most violent parts in this game are called fatalities which usually occur after the opponent has been beaten and will do an animation where they look dizzy, and if you put an a curtain input of buttons you will do a fatality which is blood and gore city, such as skin being ripped off hearts exploding being kicked in the mans parts hard enough to make the entire skeleton fly out of the body. Some parts of the fatalities are meant for laughs because the are so exaggerated. The story is full of great role models who do anything for the people they care for and the people who need it. The story is really well done and all the characters are at least pretty likable. The plot has some holes in it but barely any of note. The sex is not like Mortal Kombat 9 at all, I mean there is no sex but female characters where some pretty iffy outfits. The male outfits are basically shirtless at most. The most inappropriate outfit is Sindel's outfit with her skin being showed going down directly in between her breasts which are pretty pushed together. The buttocks shown in the game is very minor with a little butt out on the sides of the outfit. overall this is a great game and all the stuff in the game listed is very exaggerated so it kinda lessens the the violence but kinda. only 16+ if your child can handle excessive violence.
This game really isn’t that terrible if you let your kids play games like resident evil this game really isn’t all that different my kids are 12 and they love this game there’s no sex or anything in this game and again like I said it’s not all that bad and there’s hardly any swearing in this game but I doubt your kids haven’t already said or heard these words before although that’s just my opinion have a nice day
Be warned that this game is packed ton of gruesome kills and sadistic behavior. 11 isn't nowhere near as bad as some previous ones like XL. It all just depends on the maturity of understanding that its just a game. If your child isn't mature enough for sadistic violence and gore I highly do not recommend it.
This game is stupendous. It has mind blowing graphics(unreal engine 3! Generation old!) and it plays very well. Language isn't the big issue for me. While there are quite a few "f bombs" that is overshadowed by the violence! Brains are being ripped out etc. This game is even more violent than doom eternal! Yes, it is! DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR KIDS
I played this game after my 17th birthday. My family's friends claimed this game that contains extremely inappropriate for under 17 years old. It's best game for over 17 years old.
The only thing is the extreme gore including brains being eaten, I know you seen that in zombie movies but that isnt the end, Eyes popping out, Heart and organ ripping, One fatality is that raiden cuts off the upper body and the small intestine and large intestine gets exposed etc I would rate it 18+ but if you dont do fatalities or brutalities, i would recommend 16+ then
To be honest I don’t k is much about video games but Mortal Kombat I knew for its blood, violence, sexual themes, and gore. But my son bought it and brought it home to play as soon as I saw what he was playing I was furious because his little brothers were watching. So I stood and waited but watching the actual gameplay I was surprised. I thought there would be almost naked girls, guts and blood everywhere but it was actually tame but when I saw the finish him screen I got scared. I thought could this damage my young child’s brain and cause trauma but my oldest just looked back my other two and just punched him in the knee. I was relived he then explained how you could turn off all the blood and gore. And the fatalities were hard to do so I was surprised about how it changed my view and I don’t want others to have to worry it a game where you fight but you don’t see sexualized themes at all and the cussing is probably better than a 7th grades it just one person ( his name is Kano but it’s better not to play him) and I would recommend this game to others. It also has a great message it follows a army unit where it shows women leading the way and I think it represents that men and woman are powerful so I can’t say it enough I recommend it
By far the best one yet.
Mortal Kombat did always have graphic violence, but I'm disappointed they added strong language and sexual themes in it. This game now sexualizes women. I wish it would go back to how it was.
I play video games with my kids (15 and 12) and not averse to violence or FPS games (CoD, Destiny, SuperHot). This is off the charts gory. Close-ups of faces as characters die, organs or spines ripped out and quivering, violence often in slow motion. Unlike the previous Mortal Kombats (or other games with close up violence), the graphics are unnervingly realistic -- adding new dimensions to the viewer experience. It honestly makes me a little ill. Some kids have no trouble with this level of violence but they probably should. Both my kids read this review and say it is accurate. The game-playing aspects are excellent - with highly customizable characters, a solid campaign and strong female characters. But "stupendously violent" (one of the top game reviewers commentary) is the best way to put it.
can not believe this, after 25 years they destroy amazing female characters before they had an amazingly strong structure with nice custom now they cover from head to toe.. really !! men's half-naked but women all cover up. frost looks like a boy, jade face no comment. kitana looks plan I am sure Anita Sarkeesian has to do something with it she really needs to find a real job and leave the games alone.
Violence: 9/10. Very gory, characters are eviscerated, dismembered, mutilated, basically every violent thing in the book. Docking one point because it's extremely over the top and unrealistic, you never would feel sorry for the characters/get the feeling their in pain. Sex: 3/10: Shao Khan, MK's local creepy uncle makes references to his harems and sex slaves. These are very few and far between. Female characters sexuality is toned down compared to MK9. Swearing: 8/10: Frequent uses of the "F" word and other things. Drugs: 2/10: Kano frequently drinks. Quality: 9/10: Game is extremely fun, controls are tight and responsive. Story mode is amazing and doesn't take itself too seriously (which is why MK10's story sucked). The Krypt and Towers of Time are a tad too grindy for my taste but anything you can unlock is purely cosmetic so it's really fine. Matchmaking is great and I haven't run into any lag. Can definitely recommend to anyone 15+
Mortal kombat 11 is very gory when it comes to the fatalities but otherwise that's pretty much it. Unlike the previous games the female characters are not sexualized at all. They are covered up pretty well. So you don't have to worry about sexual content. But if you don't like violence or swearing this is not a game for your teen. Otherwise it's a very fun game, me and my son have had some great times on this game.
This game is super violent. Think of the worst possible death you can think of and I guarantee you this game will far surpass it. I mean most kids nowadays play Call of Duty and stuff and may be desensitized to violence. I think this just depends on your parenting preference and you kids sensitivity to extreme gore. I mean EXTREME GORE. The language is very infrequent and semi-mild. A few f-bombs (10 max) and sh*t as well god d***
Good graphics, Decently hard, Great Game!
A masterful work of art!
Like game should ge
Cuphead is great

Cuphead Game Review
Good for tweens
Decently challenging, like video games should be.
Rage-inducing but fun
great
Super hard and fun
Where to start with this game, this game is awesome! The graphics are lovely to look at to the point where they distract from the gameplay,the game is very hard but it tests the player to their limits. Some of the bosses are scary and the word "Hell" is said once or twice, but at the end of the day, Cuphead is a masterpiece.
Lets start with the graphics. It has been soooooo long since a game like this has come out and I was EXCITED! The hand-drawn visuals are on-point. You travel around the world collecting Contracts for the Devil whom you have lost a bet with. You play as either Cuphead or Mugman in this wonderful 1930's inspired platformer! Now, bare thy warning- Its very difficult. Those who rate this game one or two stars just cant simply do the game! I simply love the games little quirks! But as I said its very difficult! Maybe play the game WITH your young gamer or maybe see how they do because you don't want anyone yelling at the TV.Also if you are wondering there Is no cursing, and as a true carton should , it uses quirky words like, golly or Hot Dog! I just love my few snippets of the game!
This game is difficult. It is rage inducing, and hilarious, and sometimes makes me want to throw my controller across the room. But then you beat the boss you have been trying to defeat, and the overwhelming pride makes you want to shout. This game has amazing graphics (that we’re hand drawn, frame by frame mind you) that gives you the illusion of playing in a 1930’s cartoon. And yes, this game does deal with the devil and have the protagonist (Cuphead) go to ‘hell’ to fight the devil, but it is not going to turn your child into a devil worshipper! The ‘hell’ looks just like the other islands in the game. It is trying to teach children that gambling is BAD, not to try it. On a different note, it seems like kids are given everything on a silver platter when they play games. If they die, they respawn with all their stuff. Auto saves and ample save points in levels take away the desire to survive. It makes the games less difficult and in my opinion, less enjoyable. Shooting is the main aspect of this game, but there’s no gore, blood or actual fighting. The entire game is set around a finger gun that will repeatedly fire bullets at the enemies and bosses, and you are only shown how far they are from ‘dying’ ( they are all shown ALIVE at the end of the game) depending on what stage they’re on. Cuphead is about learning patterns and dying a few times to understand how the level/ boss works. My 9 year old son has beaten this game so many times, and he loves it. I hope you’ll consider this for your child too.
I think Cuphead is a great game
I love this game even know its hard bht i think it is good for kids 9+ :)
Some of the animations can be creepy and too hard for kids under 12.
I don't know why someone said sixteen and up my six year old son played it and was just fine.the devil smokes a cigar but that's it.
its got finger guns on the devil its really good game
It hard
Cuphead is a great run and gun video game with 1930s cartoon in it but it's a good game for kids.
It’s for competitive gamers, it’s not an easy game to play and don’t play it if you rage easily. It’s art style is beautiful though.
Although it is good, It has people in the level "Clip Joint Calamity" smoking. And it is pretty scary at the Devil battle. But it is great for learning redemption. And It also has gambling, but beside that, it is a good game!
I've often lamented how kids these days, if you put them in a room with a classic like Contra, they'd throw a fit and break the controller or end up in tears. But it's never unfair. Kids are too coddled with hand-holding and autosaves every step of the way. That said, very young kids might be scared by the song lyrics about the Devil taking the protagonists' heads if they fail (and showing their skulls once or twice). Also, some smoking and drinking in the background.
The game is really tough and frustrating and you have to get used to the enemies' attacks on it. But it's a really fun and lovely game. I like how they use the style of very old cartoons like Disney cartoons, the style of 1930s cartoons is near-perfect and I love the music in this game. A lot of the bosses are really great. Though, I'm surprised to find that a nine-year-old here finds the game easy. The bosses can be too much and they give me a headache. Though, don't play this on a laggy computer, it would be near impossible to play it when the game is lagging.
nothing bad but at the end theirs a level called one hell of a time but thats it
The graphics of this game is awesome and i think tweens can handle this game easy.
