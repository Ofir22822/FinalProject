Easly early teens
This game is amazing
BEST COD!!!!!
Pretty good campaign.
Absolutely NOT for Children
This is a great game and the age rating is way too high it is fine for any young teens and up although maybe for 10-12 year olds don't let them play the campaign but apart from that it is a very good game for most ages
It is not as bad as they say. geez give it a rest.my son loves it and it does have good role models. Parents this better than fortnite for your 12-15 son ( or daughter) to play.
The campaign is showing war. It is toned down and stylelzed a bit but you still see body's burn, you have to use a mom and a son in a part to get info,you have to shoot woman and men, and etc. It seems like many kids are saying 10+ and that's not true. Mutilplayer is definitely less bloody and Gorey but I wouldn't recommend it for kids. Over all this game is ment to touch on some of war and show some of it's dark sides. Your kid if they are 15-16+ probably know this by now and could probably find real pictures and videos of it online if they wanted to. But for the love of all things holy and good do not like a 10 year old play this game! Let them play something else not this.
Wow
This game shouldn’t be an 18 sure the campaign is a bit brutal but 18!!!!!! If I were you I wouldn’t let your kid play the campaign but let them play all the other game modes which are multiplayer and spec ops
its a great game and not violent if you turn off the blood and swearing setting it was great for my kids
I let my nine year old play this and he absolutely loved it, along with me!
Great
I’m 23, grown up with these games. Started playing around 12-13. Probably a good age to start. This games’ multiplayer I could knock down to 11. It’s just moderate violence and moderate blood. I don’t think any tween with sound mental health would be effected by it. The campaign however... one of the most graphic. One level in particular you are given a high powered sniper rifle and it can realistically shoot off the limbs and heads of enemies. Small children and tweens for sure will be disturbed by this. Otherwise a great game!
I'm letting anyone know right now. DO NOT LET CHILREN PLAY THIS!!! It's absolutely not suitable for anyone under the age of 17/18+. Hell in my opinion it seems more like for 20 and up. At first I thought it wasn't going to be this bad but then I had to see it for myself just to know how wrong I was. It's straight up disturbing, dark, brutal, too torture-some and so on that I wish I can unsee what I've seen. It questions on very, and I mean VERY heavy war topics and morals that not a lot of people will understand and just take it like "Oh, it's just a game." Not really. This COD title is very different from other COD games. It's not your typical over the top fps shooter where they're out in space or in a futuristic type of setting game no, this one shows more of reality and portray the horrors of war that can be gruesome at times, heartbreaking or unsettling. Players can make very intense decisions that it may just go over your head without thinking of the serious consequences of your actions. And there's torture. Can be very upsetting for some people. I'm not saying I didn't like it. I did. However, you shouldn't let your kid play it if they're not mature enough to handle it. It don't matter what their age is, even if you think they can handle it, I'm just saying. Don't do it. Especially if you have a sensitive child, don't desensitized them to play it. Not worth it. Maybe multiplayer mode yes, it's fine for anyone 14/15+. But the campaign mode, 18+ only!!! Seriously it takes a lot of maturity to endure and take in something. Be safe and be careful.
I have no idea why this game is 18 and up the blood is barely visible and you can't hear the swearing unless you are really listening for it this game is fine for kids with the maturity of a normal 10 year old.
This is another rehash of previous versions. Updated boards, quicker kills..same ol stuff. New campaign is the usual. A campaign for COD. Everyone knows you buy this for the multiplayer. Which the multiplayer has become a “campers” nest. More of getting shot in the back, spawn killing and parents using the game as a baby sitter. Players exploit every nook of the different maps and every shadow turning this game into something you wish you didn’t spend as much as you did.
Good game. Campaign has lots of over the top pew pew. Blood is not much of a problem this time around compared to other cod games like black ops or world at war in which you can blow peoples limbs off. Language is quite constant but its nothing worse than what your kid mostly likely hears in school or from other adults. Multiplayer is also real fun. Map selection could be better though. Great game, great campaign great multiplayer. I'm sure this game is fine for a mature tween.
Really fun game, can turn off blood, gore and swearing. I personally have my own 13 year old boy who loves it and it isn't to over the top as other Call Of Duty's can be
Fun shooter can turn off blood and swaring recomend to 13 year olds
I personally love his game especially the campaign . It’s not as violent as black ops 1 , world war 2 and world at war -to people who don’t know they are all call of duty games. I think this is the least violent multiplayer. The campaign can be dogy at times but is usually not violent at all.
This game is phenomenal! Sure it can be a bit gritty at times but you can turn blood and swearing. The campaign can be ( very rarely)disturbing but it portrays positive messages.
I havent bothered with the MP and the SP is very short at just under 4 hours (thankfully im not the one who bought the game) but its very intense and has the gameplay nuance and charm of MW1. Just dont expect a deep or morally grey story advertised so much (Russians are basically ISIS McHitler here). Its also the most graphic of the MW games. With gore akin to the Treyarch games; particularly the more grounded, brutal and disturbing kind seen in WaW or BO1 than the Tarintino-ish violence of BO2, 3 and 4. This time with 4K and photoreal detail.
This is the most disturbing, morally questionable campaign in Call of Duty history. Civilians are slaughtered by terrorists, chemical weapons are used, and war crimes are committed in abundance. Children are put in harm's way of the player. It is very much possible, and indeed likely, to kill innocent people. Players must have the maturity level to understand the seriousness of the scenarios they are in, and even then, pulling the trigger (or not) in the campaign can be straight-up traumatizing. The multiplayer portion of the game is visceral and impactful, but not nearly as harrowing as the campaign. Still, the use of white phosphorus as a kill streak is a morally bankrupt decision that taints the otherwise age 14+ multiplayer experience. That being said, Modern Warfare is a complete package. You cannot separate the campaign from the multiplayer as one grants access to the other. As a result, I highly recommend keeping this away from children altogether. The game could have carried an AO rating if it weren't coming from Activision. I have played every Call of Duty to date, and have logged thousands of hours on this franchise. This is not like the others. Don't dismiss the warnings of critics and other players. This game can and will give nightmares, and enables players to commit atrocities, by accident or otherwise. Do not make the mistake of buying this for children. Other Call of Duty games may be 'fine,' but Modern Warfare 2019 is best suited for those 18+.
oldie but goodie
This game is so fun and entertaining ! Lots of problem solving and hidden puzzles to unlock. Can be spooky but nothing your little ones can't overcome. If anything it teaches your child to brave, headstrong, and to never give up !
Nit picking
Great Action/Adventure/RPG game!
Cartoonish space game for older teens
Scary good
Great game for RPG fans
Okay so hear me out, I think how you represent the game is bogus. You must be a softcore gamer or just trying to pump out quality quickly because the outer worlds is chalk full of choices and consequences. There is consumerism. I mean the whole plot is that big corporations have taken over the colony. I don't know if you guys even play the game or just watch some random guy on youtube. Another topic I'll pick at it positive role models- in an RPG game its a given there are role models. The description you give for positive role models fits the bill if you said there were role models so I don't understand why you don't just put like 3 stars. Everything else seemed spoton- this is a great game where tons of love was poured into it and that's what I want to see more of- not cash in triple A games or indies but something in-between where it s clear everyonr loved working on it.
This game is amazing. While it has minor blood (cartoonish at that) the game is far from mindless killing. The open world and extensive choices remind me of Skyrim. The Intense violence and Blood and Gore is an major exaggeration, and there is minor mild language and one drug reference. It really is a game for 15+. ERSB has exaggerated many titles this is one of which.
Some gore but its very cartoonish, fantasy-based, non-brutal and avoidable.
This game is beautiful in every interaction. I loved how when I played it alone and when my son played it with me. It showed how much we think the same but also showed some differences between us. He liked playing as a more moral character than me. I liked The twist of being more evil(this is always how it’s been in RPGs for me,) we both got different endings to the game. I thought that was really amazing. It really is wonderful how much games have changed in my lifetime. In conclusion this is a great game it may be violent and vulgar at times but it tells a great narrative. I really loved it!
Awesome game, diverse set of characters. This is a single player and as of writing there is no micro-transactions, which basically means no in game sales for real money. While this is a game with guns, moderate violence and swearing, that's not the point of the game. The game is basically one big adventure akin to the Fallout series. The world reacts to you depending on how you play, most of the time you can talk your way through most missions without even firing a shot. The main story is that you're trying to wake some people on a ship, to do that you need some special chemicals. On your journey to get these chemicals you discover some big corporations have taken over and a few groups of people are holding on their freedom. The game also contains a wide assortment of side missions. If you let your teenager play Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Grand Theft Auto then this is totally fine for them to play.
This is good
This game is good
This game isn’t as much of a horror game as it seems
Fun depending on how you play

Well I think 7 YEARS AND OLDER CAN PLAY TH?S GAME because its so simple and good.
I’ve been watching my son play this game for the past few months. Usually he plays with friends and seems to enjoy the game; as parent I decided to see what the game was about. I was curious on what the game actually was; so I asked my son, about the game. I soon realized that the game was horror game. As a parent I soon got distressed on the fact my son was playing a horror game. I soon did a bit of research (and by actually playing the game) learned about the “horror” this game supposedly had. The game revolves around 6 kids. These kids have to find 6 keys (depending on how many) around the map too unlock a hidden door. The “horror” of the game is the neighbor who tries to capture all the kids before finding all the keys. When you’re caught the neighbor picks up the kid (in a very cartoonish way) evaporating the kid into nothing. The only scary thing is when the you finally in counter the neighbor. Nothing a kid couldn’t handle. The actual game is very cartoony and is a blast to play. Most kids around the age of 9 can easily handle this game.
Looking on the other reviews of this game, it has come to my attention that some believe this game is "too scary, and full of horror." The truth is, a kid can handle it. No kids would ever get nightmares or have bad thoughts by the intention of this game. All this game is about is kids working together trying to solve puzzles while someone is trying to capture them. No blood, no gore, no language, and being captured by the villainous neighbor isn't brutal in any way. Online chat can be used but can easily be turned off.
this game is really fun, but a little confusing on xbox one because there is a cursor on the screen. otherwise a fun spin off game for fans. although, the game is scarier then hello neighbor, and hello neighbor hide and seek. But hello guest is extremely scary( which hello guest is theroyized to be hello neighbor 2). and this game can have players talking into the microphone so you can hear them. although you can mute them, it takes time so a bad word or two might be heard. and the controls are really different from the first two hello neighbor games, otherwise not nearly as glitchy as the first two games either, which is great. also, one last thing to note is that you can spend real life money in the game for items you want so consumerism report! anyways This game is scary but very, very, fun to play.
