The Mega man Formula Refined And Perfected
Fun, but hard!
Megaman Zero/Zx Legacy Collection is a very great game with 6 classic games inside (for parents there is lots of blood in the japanese version so dont let your kids play it. the blood is actually just red oil but its like blood.)i have played mega man for most of my life and zero was always my favorite character. there are some death scenes like in Mega man Zx, a character named giro dies. And zero dies too (sadly) but they dont show it.Zero Is a great role model because at the final boss fight of zero 4, Zero says right before the fight "I never recalled ever calling myself a hero, and I only fight for those who i believe in." (giving zero his answer to the mega man x4 zero saying, "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FORRRR?!?!?!?) And he knows even if he has to lose his life to save others, he knows its for good reason.Many of the characters are good role models but Zero is the best one of them all.
This game might be rated "T", but in reality, the game itself is not bad. In fact, when the games originally came out, they were all rated "E" or "E 10+". There is a tiny bit of blood in the beginning of the first game, and the circuitry of robots are red (so it looks a bit like blood) but there is nothing gory. I myself hate blood, but this game was not disturbing in the least. It's pixilated, so the blood is NOT realistic. Now, as for the fear factor, there are some very slightly disturbing things for more sensitive viewers. A) The protagonist, Zero, kills all of the Mavericks in cold blood. B) Dr. Weil is downright CREEPY, and there is a slightly creepy image of him in game 4. One VERY important thing to know: The games are HARD. Originally, they were practically impossible for less experienced players. But with the addition of save-assist and casual scenario mode, the game can be much easier. I would say that it might be a little too tough for kids ten and under, but again, I don't know the skill level of any one kid. This game is truly a masterpiece, one of the best in the Mega Man series! It is so fun, and I would definitely give it a try, no matter your age! Play Casual Scenario Mode if you are having trouble beating the game. Thank's for reading!
why pay money when you can get it for free

Very child friendly
The original 3ds version was 10+ and this should be too. There’s nothing graphic or sexual. There is some minimal language such as hell, crap, and dumbass but most kids know those words anyway. You can buy wine but it’s only really for cooking. You don’t even kill the monsters; you just send them home. The messages are all positive and talk about community and helping others. Get this game, it’s amazing and you’ll never get tired of it.
A lot of fun for everyone
Fun builder game, shows death but satirically, no blood/gore.
Love fun games hospitals this is for you
Game is very child-friendly and very fun for most ages in my opinion, game does show death and ghosts mildly, however there is no blood or gore in the deaths or in treatments/surgery/etc. All illnesses are also fake and comedic like a disease that turns you into a clown, or puts a light bulb on your head.
Its great for content creation, but might be confusing for kids under 10
its ok for gaming
Ok
Let your mind run ABSOLUTELY wild!!!
Curentley One of My Favorite Games
Don't get me wrong, dreams is an amazing game, especially with the new vr update! there are tons of tutorials where the player has to guide a cone named "Connie" to the exit to save a cube names "Cuthbert" while learning the games creation mechanics in the process, i think its good for kids 10 and up.
i
It is a nice game with some language
Dreams is a game where you can create some things and let your imagination control you. You are able to create levels of pretty much anything, even one of your favourite games. Violence is a bit tough to rate. During the main game, mild and cartoon violence is present. Characters have magical attacks, no blood or gore. Unlike some online content. Some players create levels with violence. There is no actual blood, players use red paint to make blood effects in the environment when making say a "horror" level. Use of "$h!t" is surprisingly heard in the demos, use of "damn" and "hell." But not frequent.
Dreams is a great tool used for creation of games, music, &amp; so much more! Sure, there can be meme stuff, (Like Shrek.) but its mainly just people being creative. Check me out! Its badj0kes2012 on Dreams.
Great for kids!
Great graphics but awful lack of content.
Street Fighter V: Champion Edition is the Definitive experience!
VERY GOOD GAME, don’t use Laura or Mika.
Ok game, not much to worry about content wise
Use your own discretion
Worst game ever
its just like a bunch of action fuigures fightning not a bad game the story mode is great and i love everything about this game
This is without doubt the best graphics in street fighter games, but the lack of effort by Capcom put into this game is astoundingly disappointing, especially in arcade mode. In arcade mode each round is only one round and there are only 3 fights in a whole character story. There are only 16 characters without purchasing( you can purchase 7 characters which is disappointing compared to ultra street fighter IV ( 44 characters). Overall the only things good about SFV are the amazing graphics and enhanced combos. It also features mild violence, language and sexual images.
Street Fighter V Champion Edition is the same game, with all the previous content in one package. Violence is the main and obvious factor. Characters kick, punch, throw, scratch and bash each other. Animated blood is occasional but pretty mild. Characters grunt in pain and defeat. Language is mild. In story mode, use of "damn", "@$$", "p!$$" "hell" and "bastard" are heard. Sexuality is moderate. Female characters wear certain revealing clothing that emphasize their rather big breasts or butt.
One of my favorite games ever! Very good gameplay and very good story. I’ve only had it for a few days, and it’s the only PlayStation game I play! Some suggestive themes, like Laura and R. Mika’s clothes, but otherwise, very good, 9.9/10.
I got this game for £8 on steam and think that's a good price . The game uses a free to play model meaning that to unlock extra characters you have to "buy" them with fight money (the in game currency ). As far as I'm aware, there's no way to buy fight money, you have to earn it through playing the game (or buy one of the season passes to unlock it all at once). I don't mind this as I normally just play as ryu anyway and he (along with about 8 other characters) are avalible from the start. As for stuff that parents might not like, well there's punching, kicking e .c.t along with unrealistic special moves. So unless you're like my dad and don't like the concept of punching in games, then it's mostly fine. All the characters have unrealistic and steriotypical and exagerated designs (especially in female characters). But I don't think it's anything too bad. There's also online play but no voice chat (I think) and text chat is restricted to pre made messages. So while you can interact with other people, nothing bad can happen. There is some language such as from birdie, a British thug type character who will say things like "bugger" but this is only heard when you KO him i also read in other reviews that some other mild swear words (like "ass" were used but i can't say myself Inconclusion, the game is fine for everyone 10 and up (in my opinion) and possibly younger if there's an older sibling to makes sure things are fine .
This games review is pretty spot on. Many female characters are sexualized even to the point of comedy. My dad said of the character Rainbow Mika that she was "busting out of her bra" but honestly it's up to you whether you think it's too much. The gameplay is loads of fun, with new content added in updates every month in 2016. The meat of the game right now is in its online play- the current single player story can be beaten in an hour. A new cinematic story mode is coming which looks really fun. You have to be a member of PS Plus to go online if you didn't know. It disappointed me that online play wasn't free like in Nintendo games but I gave in and bought ps plus anyhow.
What is good:The game has good graphics. What's bad: For starters, I find the game really hard to play. It is just so difficult to use special moves. In addition to this, the move instruction manual is completely hopeless.I only figured out how to use a 'HADOKEN' 30 min into the game, plus, the 'easy' setting doesn't make a difference. last of all the characters make really unrealistic and actually quite creepy noises when they are hit. Please don't get this game. I am only trying to save your money. Complete waste of money.
the dark crystal age of resistance tactics
bad game

you should never let your kids play it
Literally the greatest game ever!
Best Story Game Ever
This game is great for kids!!
NOT MUCH VIOLENCE
Ehhh...

Really Fun Game
One of the best Star Wars games
This Game Is Amazing!
Good, but could have been better
Amazing game
Amazing Game- Pretty Brutal and immersive but very good
so so good!
a great game based on the popular franchise.
One of the best games I’ve played!
Fantastic in every way
People are wrong
Amazing!!!
I'm the biggest Star Wars Geek out there and of course I got to play this game. The story is amazing and the graphics make it look like its a live action movie. Some parts are a little mature. Such as when you go to Dathomir and are sent to fight against undead witches and demon looking men. Some special moves are shown slicing troopers or stabbing them but never taking the body parts off! Highly recommend it if you or your child is really into Star Wars
Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order is probably the best Star Wars game ever rivalling Star Wars battlefront II (the original) and Star Wars Kights Of The Old Republic. As you play through the story you will experience lots of twists and turns to the plot and some exciting boss fights. I recommend that if you do get this game, you should go off to explore and find secrets. The game has thoughtful and challenging combat using a lightsaber. None of the combat is particularly violent, occasionally you can slice creatures (no humans) lims or intire body in half which may be too intense for younger children. There are also some dark story themes to it. The main ones being a main character going through torture and a witch bringing her dead sisters back to life using powerful rituals. Overall though this game is fine for anyone aged 13+. Great game.
this game is utterly amazing the graphics and the story are out of this world hours upon hours of play with this game. The does include fighting but no blood or anything along those lines are shown the game is great for kids that want a challenge the fighting mechanics can be hard even for long time gamer's like myself but practice makes perfect and this game has a lot of room for trial and error so dont be afraid of losing great for kids 8 and up and would highly recommend this. No swearing, No hardcore violence an great fun for star wars fans
its a good game there is no swearing(some violence)but not that much of violence it should be 12+ i liked the game it was fun and i also think that pegi is NOT always right so i use this website to see the ratings of parents and kids, sometimes pegi exaggerate. at the end i want to thank common sense media and parents. and thanks to EA and RESPAWN ENTERTAINMENT. THANK YOU ALL.
I guess it's Ok? I got stuck on one part a year ago and stopped playing but IDK...
It's a good game there is violence but it's a star wars game so what do you expect there is lots of parkour and but after you finish the game it gets boring so it was fun while it lasted!
This game is really good. The story is really intriguing, and there is a nice learning curve for the gameplay. For Star Wars fans, this game is a really fun expansion to the universe.
It doesn't matter if your into Star Wars or not, you have to play this game!!! Jedi Fallen Order is an action adventure game with a captivating and intriguing story with a sense of mystery and being part of something bigger. It has some of the best graphics, level design and storytelling out there. The only problem is that it doesn't have multiplayer, which isn't even that big of a critisism! Just go and buy it, now!
This game is beautifully crafted from both a star wars cinematic universe standpoint, and just as a game in general. The story is engaging, very elaborate and overall expertly crafted like something from a tv series. The fighting sequences are amazing as well. as for violence, this game isnt really that violent. I know slicing people with lightsabers would appear to be violent, but the violence isnt glorified in any way (as the main character is fighting for peace) and the battles arent too intense either (theres no blood or gore really). To be honest, thats really the only thing that would constitute concerns parentally and there isnt much else weighing on this brilliant game. Overall, as long as you think your kid is mature enough for the mild violence in this game, i think it is a must-purchase for star wars fans!!!
The game's storyline is impressive, although at the beginning at the game there is some profanity. There is alots of peril and the use of H*ll and b*stard. There is no dismemberment like the other games. The story is not finished though. Enemies will discourage you and insult you.
I have completed this game twice and it is my second favorite star wars game of all time!(Behind Battlefront 2) I dont know about the T rating by ESRB. The worst thing in this game is dismemberment. Not human dismemberment though! Animal dismemberment. And even so the violence is not bat at all. I think it's fine for anyone 7 and up. Please pick this game up for your kid!
Not a pegi 16, no idea what that was about, suitable for any age but might be a bit complex for younger kids. Someone was waffling about witchcraft in the game, I mean, grow up, witches aren't real and we burnt lots of innocent women by pretending they were. So unless your silly enough to be scared of 'demonic forces' in the game, I suggest you buy it immediately.
Here is my Ratings Violence: There is loads of violence, you can impale people with your lightsaber and smash them into the ground. You can also slice them across the waist causing lightsaber slashes to appear on them. With the humans here is no blood or dismemberment, however you can slice creatures in half and even cut their head’s off in some places. Sex: none Language: They use hell sometimes and the word Bas***d is used once in a cutscene Positive Role models:: with an excellent story and Cal as the main character there are lots of positive role models in the game Fear: there is menacing music and in a cut scene a woman Jedi is tortured by the empire but a black screen covers most of it up Amazing game with a brilliant campaign but definitely not for younger kids!
one of the best games ive ever played. really addicting and fun although there are some very hard parts that get you frusturated so would not recomend for non serious gamers
this game is great! there is of course fighting, but no blood is actually shown. there is little swearing, with only moderate levels. great for fans of star wars.
I recently started playing it again, and I forgot how brilliant it is, the best way to describe it is “baby’s first dark souls” it’s definitely in my top 5.
Graphics: B+ The visuals are fantastic, but the game may be a bit glitchy, only during cutscenes. However, that problem differs between people. Gameplay: A The controls are different, but well thought-out. A lengthy "tutorial" that really feels like the game will teach you everything you need to know. Different difficulty settings make it appropriate for everyone. Still, some puzzles may be difficult for younger children. Story: A+++ I'm sorry, but the comics made me a sucker for the Inquisitors. There's so much brilliance in the game's writing that I can't describe it all. It's incredibly immersive, and some parts literally made me shiver with joy. Not only is it fun, it's heartfelt, with messages of finding yourself and getting through sadness.
Listen up. Saying the violence is intense is stupid. It's Star Wars violence. There is no blood just little orange marks on Stormtrooper bodies. Not bad. If you can't handle the concept that human beings can die than you need to toughen up.
To start, this is not 14 and up. I think a 9 year old could play it. Violence: 6/10, There is a fair amount of violence but it is not bloody or graphic. It should be fine for 8 year old's. Language: 3/10, There is one use of the B word. Sex: 0/10 Drinking- drugs, 0/10 Overall, this is a really good game that cut's back on the bloody violence and focuses on puzzles
