Overwatch has no gore and has only fantasy violence. As long as the person who is playing it knows what fantasy violence is it should be fine. Overwatch is a great game if you are looking for a first person shooter that has no gore and only has fantasy violence.
Little swearing, but it is Damn and little blood, only if you get super close to Roadhog and shoot
I honestly was not expecting much from this game. I thought it was just going to be another violent online shooter game. As I played this game I realized that the graphics are different from other FPS (First Person Shooter)games or games in general. It is actually really cartoonish and fun. I love how you can choose between a ton of different characters. I also like how you can change to a different characters throughout the game. My personal favorite character is McCree because he is a cowboy. I am a little sad that the creators of this game didn't give it a camping. Although I do like how there are different skilled people playing against you. I really like how the graphics are not realistic and more like a cartoon. I think they will make a second Overwatch because of how successful this first Overwatch was. The reason I think this game is OK for teens thirteen and up is because there is violence (the violence dose not focus on the blood or realistic stuff) and McCree smokes a cigar. Overall I recommend Overwatch to any Halo of Titanfall fan.
Overwatch is an interesting case. The game is multiplayer only, with no story contained in the game itself, other than some lines between the characters themselves, Overwatch seems to be a game designed with the experience being the only priority in mind, but through other forms of media, the game has established a consistent story and universe, which conveys many positive messages about social issues in the real world, which can positively influence teenage, and younger audiences. The story surrounding the game revolves around Racism and discrimination against a race of self aware robots which are clearly supposed to symbolize minorities. The story also touches base on other issues, The main character in the series was revealed to be homosexual last year, and many characters' stories revolve around moving on from loss, and above all, using tragedy as incentive to be a hero, and never let anyone else suffer that way.
the reason i rate overwatch 14+ is because some kids may not get how competitive this game really is, plus open voice chat, reaper says "damn" quite often (mainly when losing the payload) soldier 76 is a great role model because of his courage and determination, when playing as heavy characters such as roadhog, d.va, etc, there will be very little but some blood, easy controls, McCree often has a cigar hanging from his lip which can be impressionable to younger players. some characters such as d.va, mercy, and widowmaker, often show off their looks (no full nudity is shown, no sex scenes). Every once in a while someone will try to lag/hack the map, it only makes the map lag a lot. Other than these reasons overwatch players are good to go.
git it
Overwatch is great for anyone, really. The reason i've rated it for kids 10 and up is because if you turn on the voice chat, there can be other people speaking and it is unmoderated, meaning that there could be swear words jumping around. However, there is an option to turn off voice chat in the settings, in which case i'd say that anyone can play it if they are able to, basically. There is hardly any violence at all, and it's a very fun game to play. I have no idea why it's given 4/5 for consumerism in the review. I guess there is one character who holds a cigar. That's all I can think of. The game emanates a positive message of hope, justice and heroism. The main face of the game, Tracer's main voice line is "The world could always use more heroes!". That's basically what the game is about. Heroes, and saving the world. On YouTube you can find character backstories about how the Overwatch characters came to be. I'd recommend watching them; they're very entertaining and show what Overwatch is about.
Short answer: -Light atmosphere -Gun/melee weapon violence -Briefly appearing blood -Mild language -Somewhat revealing unlockable outfits -Chat system with a filter that can be turned off, or completely unfiltered voice chat -One character with a cigar, alcohol reference Overall, some things to be aware of, but definitely better than the popular M rated games. Detailed answer: Overwatch is a fast-paced, team-based shooter game. With its bright colors and light atmosphere, the game is much more family friendly than almost any other first-person shooter on the market. The game has some violence, but nothing particularly intense. It could include shooting a gun, hitting someone with a hammer, or hitting someone with your gun. When a character takes damage, a brief splash of blood appears, then in a fraction of a second, will disappear. No gore whatsoever. Some characters have lines every now and then that include mild language. (This also happens when nearly any character receives the Orb of Discord.) Still, definitely preferable to most other shooters. As the game progresses, you can unlock changes to the character's outfits, some of which reveal the stomach- but no privates. (D.va, Symmetra, and Tracer fall under this category.) The gaming community is infamous for being very foul-mouthed. If your team is losing, you will almost certainly hear profanity over the voice chat- HOWEVER, you will not hear other's voices if you do not opt into using your own voice. Stay out of voice chat, and leave the written chat filter on to avoid anything more than mild language. Finally, the cowboy character McCree, smokes a cigar. There are also a couple references to alcohol, such as something along the lines of- "You know, Hanzo, that sake ain't half bad... But I think I prefer whiskey myself.", or just simply "Beer!" But, you do not hear these lines very frequently. That's everything I can think of to be aware of, as far as age rating goes. Have fun, and stay safe!
Everything about what they said in the video review was right. Even the voice chat, and people can say bad words a lot. Mostly because of raging on their team because they suck. But, there is a way to turn off voice chat in two ways: One is to go to options and lower the voice chat volume and Two is to turn off voice chat. I have this game on my xbox one s and I was annoyed of all the screaming of other players. So I took 5 minutes to look in the options and I found the answers, or the two ways to turn off voice chat.
This game is a fun game with some non-graphic violence. It is fairly easy to learn, especially if the player has first-person shooter experience. There is little blood, just when you are taking damage there is unrealistic red at the corners of the screen. Other than that, this game is a pretty good game if you are sensitive about your kids playing shooter games because it is not too violent and fairly easy to learn. There is open chat since this is an all online game so there is unmoderated chat and there can be dirty language.
This game is an all multiplayer shooter, so language could be heard over open chat. But you can mute other players so thats not really a problem. Barely any blood. Ages 9+ can handle it. Could be E10+ probably.
common sense media always over exaggerate if its a shooter this is literally a shooter for kids it is not even violent and the chat can be disabled thank you for reading :)
This game is amazing for teens-adults that love the FPS genre. Though, i can't help but notice the reviews obviously from fake kid-accounts pretending to be adults just to give the game a really under-rated age-group, like "3 to 9+", if you hand this game to a 3 year old he would barely even know how to open the disc case. the game isn't that violent to be honest, the most you get is the smallest bit of gore, which is (at the most) a splash of red out of mid-air in front of an enemy. I'd say that this game is at the very least appropriate for a 12 year old. As for the content, there is 1 specific character that smokes, but that's the most you'd see. There is minimal swearing, though too small of an amount to even notice, As for "partial nudity" there is 1 character with an open gap within the front of the outfit, other than that,there is a few "slim" outfits that aren't too blatantly inappropriate. But like i said, the ESRB rating is right, the game should be meant for 13+ teens and adults.
Overwatch is a 6 VS 6 multiplayer FPS game by Blizzard, makers of World Of Warcraft and Starcraft among other things. It somewhat borrows from the MOBA genre of games with its ability based method of combat. You have a weapon, sometimes 2 like Torbjorn having a hammer and a shotgun-type thing that fires molten metal, an alternate-fire sometimes like Roadhog's mid-range shot, and a handful of abilities such as Pharah being able to rocket up into the air or shoot a missile that knocks back players. All heroes have an ultimate ability that can change the tide of battle, such as Mercy reviving all of her teammates within range or Junkrat activating a remote controlled exploding tire, but ultimate abilities(commonly referred to as ults) have to charge up before unleashing their power. There are 25 heroes, with more on the way. Each hero comes from a different background and has a different play style, such as the speedy British Tracer who can teleport and rewind her own time back a few seconds to the Korean mecha pilot Hana Song, also known as D.Va, who can charge in and provide supporting fire with her rapid-fire cannons to the popular DJ L?cio, who plays a song to either heal his teammates or increase their movement speed. Games are fast and fun, and if you join a custom game you can play fun mini games like Hide And Seek or Simon Says. Blood is limited to a red pixels showing up on your screen when shooting at a target at close range and has no blood splatter effects on the ground or walls. There are a large number of female characters(almost half the cast of heroes) so it includes strong role models. There is some mild swearing but that's limited to a couple of characters saying "damn" and that's only if the filter is turned off.. Voice chat is unmoderated but if someone is being annoying or rude you can mute their audio and you won't hear them speaking. Maps range from taking place in an abandoned castle in Germany to the fictional city of Hanamura, Japan, to even on the moon! Straightforward controls and excellent design with characters, maps, and mechanics make Overwatch, all in all, very fun and enjoyable.
Really fun game, lots of diversity, great for all ages.
Very fun
Overwatch is a first person shooter revolved around shooting the other team to either capturing a objective or moving a vehicle across the map. With a set of 24 characters to play as it's a competitive fun game 10+ kids should be able to enjoy
This is my friend's favorite video game, and she told me about the Free Weekend. I downloaded and played Overwatch, and lemme just say: it's FUN and ADDICTING. The heroes are all unique and colorful in their own way. This game teaches skill and strategy, and almost doesn't focus a lot on violence. Now I'm trying to convince my dad to buy this game.
It is literally the cleanest fps game since splatoon
I know it's rated T for Teen, but really, it's not that bad. There's barely any blood and you can only see it if you are really close. No gore. Sometimes there is some language, but it's not strong (it's the D-A word if you were wondering), as long as your kid is mature, I think you should get it for them. Oh, and I forgot to tell you that one character smokes, and another character you can see the side of their breasts.
UNFAIR HEROES AND LOOTBOXES SUCK
Amazing, but don't play competitively if you're young :/
Overwatch
Overwatch is more kid friendlier than the rest of the First person shooter games.

I've been playing Overwatch since it first released. I got the origins edition, and the full game on pc to show my support. Many things are great about this game, for example, once you pay for the game, you don't have to pay for anything else after unless you want to. Every review I've seen so far just addresses the wonderland full of battles and characters, but one thing I love about the game is the strategy. It forces you to play to your team's strengths and weaknesses, and it forces you to do what you have to do if you want to win. There are many team roles in this game, and many seem to ignore it, but it's a huge part of this game. It teaches many that if you don't have a good person filling that niche, it can easily fall apart without coordination. You don't even need aim to play this game at all, in fact, you can play several other heroes that can help you as a crutch and STILL be useful. There's high skill ceilings and floors for many heroes, and it will take awhile to master many of them. The major part of this is that in order to really experience the game at the height of what it is, is to play as much as you can. The game constantly puts out new events and releases fresh content that anyone would love. On the topic of the characters, they're great in design and backstory. Every character has something that many can identify with, and will have a great time playing as in the world of Overwatch. I'm a teen, and I play a lot of competitive Overwatch. I wouldn't recommend slapping your 8 year old child into a game who thinks he runs the town by playing a shoddy sniper. It ruins the experience for everyone. Do the community a favor and mature before you play the game.
I think this is a great game. No blood. Very fun I started when I was 10 years. Not voilance at all please belive I think if you asked most people that they would say yes or some say no but it hasn't efficted me at all verey good
Just because there are no explicit swearing heard usually,and the characters are drawn in a Pixar art style and have awesome futuristic weapons which are designed to not be too violent for a standard first person shooter game.And also there is no blood or visible gore in this game just like they have no sex or sexual themes.There are positive role models,but the most clear as crystal moments are for Tracer,Winston,Mei and some heroes you may refer to as role models such as Mercy. And also if there is the chat mode turned on...the game will be far from kid friendly because of vulgar and insulting comments that sound like the ones you heard from cyberbullying.
i downt lik pleyin tis gayme cuz it es way 2 glory. et gave mi knitemars
GUNS
There was no sex nor sexual references at all throughout the game with no drugs whatsoever unless you include one character who smokes. Otherwise it is a great game which anyone can enjoy, kids and parents alike. However, some of the language people use on the chats can be rude and sometimes mean, I usually only play with friends or AI.
great game for kids above ten and also is cartoony pics won't see any blood so very good for violence games
I have played this game for a while, and you learn that teamwork is the best strategy for winning. The deaths are nothing like games such as Call of Duty, the graphic violence isn't visible, just a health bar dropping. Role models are positive, because it teaches you to stand up against bullies. The storyline mainly has to do with a robot war, and you are there to keep peace with robots. Anyone would easily be fine with it. McCree, the cowboy sort of character, smokes, but not many people use him. I recommend this for 8+ if your child is mature. Trust me it is completely fine.
The fact that they gave it a 2 in sex is offensive. There is nothing like that at all. The worse that there are girls in skin tight pants but that's it. There is basically no drugs at all except someone who is smoking and that is not very apparent.
it says in the rating that it is rated t for blood,tobacco use,and violence but there is absolutely no blood.One character is smoking a cigar which is never brought up and barley noticeable. but there is violence but is not that bad like call of duty.
You would think that I'm writing this review to tell you how bad first person shooters can be and they make kids crazy. No that's not true this game is not violent or bloody
Overwatch is like any lego game. You eliminate the enemy team in order to complete the objective. The only difference with overwatch is there are more guns and more details to the guns.
Very good. Violence is quite limited, but cartoonish. Comp scene is very good, but queuing leaves some to be desired. Tons of bad team comps, but w/ friends it's fine. Very physically and ethnically diverse with characters from: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany,Russia,Sweden,US,UK,Brazil,UAE,Egypt,Mexico,and more to come. Also has a gay character.
Great game. there isn't ANY nudity or drugs. The only thing with drugs is a guy in the game that smokes a cigaret. Also the game is multiplayer, and there is a chat. If you don't want your kid hearing anything bad, simply turn off the Voice chat in settings. It is a hard game, and can sometimes be frustrating. The violence is very cartoony, so you shouldn't be worried about it. As long as your kid doesn't rage at other games and things like that, he/she should be fine with the game.
Overwatch's age rating is too high. There is mild blood but not much else. The blood id barely noticeable and I didn't realize there was blood at all until I was playing for about 5 MONTHS. Great game over all though.
I have seen many people play Overwatch, and from what I've seen, there is almost no gore and is very fun. The only thing that I could see that's wrong with it is the social interaction element. Players can chat, in a message or talk, and can play with strangers. Other then that, if your kids can play responsibly, I think it should be fine for anyone 10 or over.
lets see the good of the game before we see the bad...It helps children co-operate with teammates.Next bad stuff in this game Is hard to find.There is blood but you don't notice,There is a Hero that smokes a cigar a lot of the time.Some heros have reaveling costumes but That dosn't matter the first thing is online chat.But this can be avoided by not joining parties. I play this on my youtube channel and it's child friendly enough.
Just because there is guns doesn't mean that it is violent and bloody. No blood and it more like lasers that you shoot. Young kids might not like it because of how hard it is.
