Awkward controls and boost gimmick may ruin the game for you.
Easy to play, hard to master.
It's standard issue cart racing. weapons, cutesie characters and various tracks set in cartoon environments with hazards and speed boosts. Our problem with this game is HOW you boost and the uncomfortable control layout, and even with a second control layout option, neither works well. I'm a gamer and I found my hand cramping (and I play games where ALL the buttons, even the stick ones are used), In order to gain boost you have 2 buttons that are the same, it's a hop/ drift button, being both bumper buttons. You start the drift with one button and hold it down but DO NOT try to steer back at all until the hop is done as it is unforgiving, then each time your meter fills and you see black smoke , you hit the other one up to 3 times for boost. The boost happens 'during" the drift also instead of the standard of gaining it for straightaways making it exeptionally hard to steer when pulling this off. The gas can be the Right trigger or the bottom pad button but the whole process is very tedious and button mashy This is along with the fact that in many cases you need to stop doing one thing in order to press your attack button for items. The drifting/ boost mechanic does NOT flow well and makes it hard to steer at all and it's more of a hinderance to staying on the track than LITERALLY anything else in the game. We love Mario Kart, Blur and even Sonic All Stars and Sonic Team racing were decent. But THIS just feels unenjoyable with a tedious mechanic that simply breaks our ability have fun with this game, Younger ones may get especially frustrated with the finicky timing and button yoga you have to acheive unlike just about any other cart and racing games. I wasted 40 bucks. Better to go Sonic Team Racing in our opinion. Couldn't be more bummed how bad the controls are here, and it's paramount to winning any race at all to progress. Cuz if you can't boost consistantly and often, you may as well not even play it and that's the sad truth.
A little bit too hard for kids ages 6 and under but aside from that there's only one thing and that's microtransactions. Microtransactions are in this game and they are NOT micro. They can cost up to $11.
Okay For Kids Who Think
Doesn't deserve to be rated Mature...
One of my favourite games
Simple concept with arcade style dumb fun.
Okay for tweens. Some violence. No language. Fun game. I approve.
Let me start off the review by saying that this game is not as violent as the website shapes it out to be. It does involve violence, but the blood can be turned off through settings. Even with blood on, you can tell it’s fake through the ketchup-like effects. Ignoring the violence, the game can provide a different way of thinking through its many puzzles and challenges it puts you through. I allowed my 14 year old child to play this game, as long as I watched the first few minutes. I think that this game is okay for any child who is a thinker. If your child is into first-person shoot ‘em ups, this game is most likely not for them. I think this game should be left to tweens and up.
The game isn't nearly as violent as other people say. It should be rated teen. My 12 year old asked for me to buy it, I researched the game to see if it was appropriate or not. I was a little skeptical at first because of all of the killing, but you can turn off the blood, and you are killing bad guys. I bought the game for him. After he played for a while he was very exited. He really liked the flips and slo-motion. I tried it for a little bit, and found that it is really fun, but pretty hard for me.
Mfp is a 2.5d action game with lots of shooting and explosions but you can turn off blood so blood is not a problem but when you shoot and explosive neer an enime there arms legs and head will fly everywhere but because it is 2d the camera is to far away to see it properly, sometimes enemies will say the s word but this is rare and it only comes up in a text box so all in all the game is fine for 12 and up I would recommend the pc version over the others but if you're on console it is still a great game
Another game where you shoot stuff and it wants to be quirky for the novelty and attention....true. But It's just fun to kill time with. There's no weight to it or time limits, you can just go through at your own pace or try to bum rush each level with all the spaz you can muster to gain more style points. It's a nice open ended shooty game that seems made for leisure and simplicity of use. Slow motion and quickly interchangeable guns, some light platforming and puzzles, maybe a dream sequence or 2 where you get to fly like a helicopter. If being a ninja with guns and Matrix time bending / dodging sounds remotely fun, it's worth a try, especially if upon reading this it is still available with Xbox game pass and you have it. Then you don't have to fork out the expense just to try it. Some gripes: The weak feeling basic jump is a little off and doesn't have the "oompf" to go with the overall mobility. Getting a jump off the ground often feels like your man is a paper doll instead of a butt kicker. The weapons and enemies can start to feel a bit stale after awhile, although they try to keep the levels interesting, at times you feel the simplicity and limits set for the game and almost hope they turn out a sequel that fleshes out the concept more. I recommend this game, at least as a break from the seriousness and grinding of other shooters, especially the online FPS games with endless, repetative chore lists for gear. This game fills a good arcade niche of just wanting to hop on, kill some baddies with stylish simplicity, maybe have a chuckle and go about your day. Good enough for me!
Good Castlevania Clone; perhaps less sexualization in the next title
Has lots of Castlevania easter eggs, and is challenging. If you are a fan, you can pinpoint which easter egg came from which game. Has a bit of an identity crisis until about 70% through the game where you finally get some unique qualities. One thing to add is that it's not just the first boss that shows breasts, but there is a vampire boss that is sexualized, as well as some of the lesser enemies and even a nun wearing skin tight clothing, each character I have mentioned has big breasts. The main character herself is sexualized a little, showing her big breasts just enough to show a crystalized tattoo, which the story justifies as too painful to cover and happens to be on her heart... The main character also stands in a way that shows her figure (the game justifies this as a sword stance) There are better examples of characters that aren't sexualized within the game, but contrasted with bosses and jiggle physics (big breasts being overrepresented), they could do better on the character designs. Otherwise, the game is quite fun and challenging.
Pretty Innocent
The game is cartoony and and is, overall, pretty innocent. The 15+ rating that C.S.M. gave the game is insane. They should rename the company to ComedySenseMedia. Honestly, are overprotective Cristian moms writing these reviews?!
Depends on level
It’s fine
Vr
ABSOLUTE MATURE 17+
i almost peed!
Fun and scary for everyone over 13
It's even more terrifying in VR.
Horrid thing
Don’t listen to any one else!
parents your probably think from the images that this is scary but it is not its fine theres no blood or gore the jumpscares can be frighning but it is kinda funny i let my 8 year old son play this and he loves it i looks scary but more fun then scary.
Fun
Amazing
I SCREAMED!
its a little scary for 8 year olds
It can change depending on the level such as animatronic repair being 7 and over in my opinion and dread bear being mature 12 or 16 but great game dissent matter what you like everybody enjoys it because you scream and 5 seconds later your all laughing but the back story is very dark so if your young try not to read the back story but once your older the backstory very good and interesting
Its fine it is a horror genre Other parents has said “TO SCARY17+” but if you get it then you know what your getting into But don’t let kids under 13 see the tape messenges they reveal some dark things but other than that kids 8- will be scared by dark rooms and night terrors switch is a good version for kids but older than 12 then VR is fine
Amazing game and amazing story, but very scary. Me and my child play it. We like it but get scared. So good.
This is EXACTLY like the original so it has the same story line and everything. But the VR just adds to the horror!
SO SCARY!! its fun but too scary for under 13!
Its really fun and it's rated T for a reason guys. If your to scared to play it thats fine but your reaction isn't the same as everyone else. I see 10 year olds playing this game and having a good time.
Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted is not a game for the easily scared. Multiple times I found myself throwing off the headset because I couldn't take the tension, and this is before the homicidal animatronics came anywhere near me. I have to say, whoever made this game did an excellent job at making it absolutely terrifying. If you can make it through the game without quitting however (and that's a big 'if'), it's actually pretty good. I'd recommend it anyone who owns a VR headset and thinks they can handle the horror. No kiddies though, or you'll be dealing with nightmares for at least a week. 8/10.
This is a bad game don’t play it it will give your child nightmares. It has too many jump scares and can very much scare you. DONT PLAY IT!!!
It’s a good game overall with a lot of good scares but the backstory is gruesome and very horrific, as long as you don’t let your child learn about the back story you’ll be fine!
this is fine for kids
Amazing interpretation of the original games and added lore.
If you want it you can play it with ease
Omg SO FUN!!!! but so scary!I am a serious gamer and i think its probably for early teens so if you are younger than 8 EXTREME SCARINESS!
an 8 year old would be afraid of it trust me
Good game with good concepts feels too anemic.
Read mine
Past Sonic racing installments have had larger rosters and more unique feeling tracks. Although the game runs smoothly, the tracks don't feel different enough to make them much more than backdrop to similar turns and scenarios. The team concept and up to 4 player split screen is perfect for some couch co-op with the option of playing on the same team/ different teams or as individual rivals. THIS is unique and an interesting dynamic. Aside from the novelty though, the rest of the game seems cut short in almost every other way, With just over 20 tracks and 12 racers, it all seems tame and unexiting once you've run the courses and become accustomed to the small variety of racers. The racers themselves are divided into 3 groups with SPEED type, a "skill" type that goes through terrain effortlessly, and a sort of "tank" type that bashes through obstacles. The racer roster is ALL Sonic characters this time,so no other Sega All Stars make an appearance. Each car is tied to it's perspective character and has performance stats that can be upgraded as well as several asthetic components to customize the look of your car. All that said, it seems that the base game itself doesn't offer long term variety in the tracks or anything outstanding or meaningful to make them feel different or set one apart from the other, it just feels like a potluck of components mixed together in various ways rather than fully fleshed out and unique concepts. Over all, this is a good game to burn some time with family and friends for a few hours, but I don't think it will hold most peoples interests for long or keep you coming back. Also with Mario Kart 8 being a far superior game overall and Crash Bandicoot Kart Racing coming out, this one will probably end up on the pile of mediocre Sonic games. In the end, unfortunately, this is merely a novelty game at best which is disappointing given the long drought of quality Arcade racers the past few years on consoles and the opportune window they had to turn this into something memorable that gamers have been craving for quite some time. PS- Some of the tracks can be a little blurry and confusing, especially trying to look into the distance. We recommend a 4k TV for best performance as anything below that can be a strain on the eyes, especially the larger TVs where the pixels are enlarged and less defined. This game in particular has some poor depth color schemes in a few tracks and this is especially noticable in racing games in general. Smaller TVs should be fine in single player, but 4k HD will be highly beneficial on larger TVs, especially playing split screen co-op.
It's sonic the hedghog? Ok I'll buy that thanks
I play this game with my son and it is great
Boring
Hate it
No thanks.
first I want to say that commence has consumerism at 4 out of 5 which I think is crazy it should only be at 2 or 3 out of 5. But like I said in the title I play it with my son and we have a blast working together to take down behemoths . I am not a big fan of shooters because you shoot other people just trying to have fun playing a game but you can even hurt your team so you just work together to save the world. I think this dauntless is great for kids that just want to try a new game for free.
Play Monster Hunter. Cause this is just a clone of that but after 10h it gets boring as you are just replaying all the monsters at slightly higher level. Monster Hunter: World is free on Xbox game pass and I’d much rather play that than this. However, with Monster Hunter’s more mature themes and Dauntless’s ease of play, this might be the ticket for young tweens.
I thought I would give this game a try because a LOT of people were playing it and it was free but it isn’t fun at all. I did not enjoy a second of it. The quests on the game are just boring and stupid. I am sure there is someone out there who likes this game but it most certainly not me. — What’s in the game? Violence - Players use swords, axes, hammers, guns, and grenades to attack aggressive monsters that take a range of forms, from reptiles to giant birds. Bright red blood splashes appear with each hit. As battles wear on, monsters show wounds in their skin and lose parts of their bodies, such as their tails.
Already have a 16yo who is owned by Epic. (Not literally but nearly). Need to maintain some sanity and keep my 12yo off the role playing games for as long as possible. He won't be able to handle the addictive quality. It really depends on your kid and how skilled you all are at negotiating time, money, homework, health, eating, hygiene etc. And how much patience do you have? Does your child tantrum easily? Haha! Good luck!!
