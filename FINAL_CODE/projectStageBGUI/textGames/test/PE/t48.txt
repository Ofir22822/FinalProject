Most games get boring...
But this doesn't. Highly recommend for any age level. Super easy to pick up and super fun to play. NOT A MATCH THREE GAME. Way better than that, way more original.
A perfect remake
Bright, colorful remake of an original Zelda game.
Great Game!
Fun game
Amazing game!
educative
This game is absolutely amazing. The combat is simple yet sometimes challenging, the puzzles range from obvious to obscure, the story is completely amazing, this is a perfect remake. My only complaint is that Nintendo always nags you to buy Amiibo.
The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening is a cartoonish remake of an old game for the Gameboy. Link is shipwrecked on Koholint Island, where he must gather eight instruments in order to wake the Wind Fish. Link does fight monsters on his journey, but the combat is very cartoonish. The only reason I say this game is 8+ is because some of the puzzles can be very challenging. Other than that I think this game is okay is 5-year-olds.
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was a challenging but fun game. Although the world was very small, there was always lots to do. The great story mixed with the very hard dungeons makes an amazing game. Although this game is probably very challenging for younger kids because of all the obscure but important details, and the impossible dungeons, this game is a treat. The Zelda series never disappoints! Overall, this is a wonderful game
Hi. happy 2020. I havn't made a review in a while but my mom finnaly let me get a game. I've been studying really hard in school and she said i can get a game if dad said it was ok. I'm 11 now so she said i could. I've been playing this game alot and its really fun. the 1 thing i don't like is the violece . This game doesnt have much but it's there. You even have too use a sword and that's something my mom said isnt good. my mom said its ok as long as i dont play it for over an hour a day. also my mom said reading is good for getting better at writing so i'm working really hard at it. The reading is helpful. i'm not that good at typing thoug so i have to work on that too. anyway i hope .i . can get back to reviews again these are fun. You should get this game if your okay with some violence.
It's a brilliant game with lots of puzzles to solve and adventuring. Some parts can be a bit hard to figure out though, but I don't think thats a bad thing!
this game really helps you and trains your brain
Parents-download this and you hit the jackpot
SO FUN!
No violence stealth game!
The greatest game ever.
A Very Unique Hidden Gem of Third Party Producers
PEACE WAS NOT AN OPTION
It’s fine
Its amazing! the controls hard though. No violence nobody can talk no other users around no chat no sex no drinking no nothing its a amazing puzzle game that encourages clever thinking and problem solving!
its the best puzzle game ever no one talks in the game so no languge there is no sex or romance so cross that and no violence you cant interact or see other players ( I think) there is no consumerism (again I think) its not extactly easy to play the controls are hard to control the game is just about being a goose and cause a lot of trouble I recommend if your looking for a great puzzle game!
Finally! A stealth game without any shooting or violence! Untitled Goose game may sound stupid but I think it's one of the best games to come out in 2019. This game hasn't got any role models or great message but it's a stealth puzzle game so it has got some educational value.
Untitled Goose Game is a hilarious game where you cause as much mischief as possible.
This is such a unique game on so many levels as no one has never made a game like this. As you are a goose who's a jerk to people, it's a really fun change of things in video games. My only problem would be that it's not as long as I had hoped, but that's okay because that should be expected from a smaller production company. I highly recommend especially if you're looking for something different and unique
Would let any small child play if they understood how
good, over rated
fun
the only problem with it is that you need apple arcade to play, which costs money and is like a subscription
Improved hockey game with some violence.
SO fun and easy
Actually not bad
Title available for a $20 purchase
NHL 20
I have recently got the game and, to be honest I love it! There is something for everyone and it is unlike other EA games with the fact they don't try to make you buy everything. It is very positive and easy to play. It has a bit of fighting but nothing that will desensitise you. There are positive role models and it gives you a lot of satisfaction when you win a game. Parents, this game is fine.
so fun and easy
It does make you buy a lot of in game stuff to make your hut team good but if you don’t care about that and only care about beating other teams with your team and this game is perfect because you basically do whatever you want you make your own team become a pro become a GM all and all it’s not a bad game it is a little pricey though
Unlock review expansion for $60
I think that NHL 20 is just like a hockey simulation, so there is of course a little bit of violence. I think if you enjoy hockey you will love this game.
Great game easy to play. But since it's a game by EA you could spend thousands of dollars on in game purchases.
11+
This is because violence is animated and not super realistic. The language is also not terrible and the dialogs are fun and by the end of the game, you have a whole storyline!
Violence and suggestive themes
There is a setting to turn off gore
Really?
Great game but language and gory stuff
Violent and Mature but AMAZING game
Really fun but a bit brutal and inappropriate
Turn off Gore
Is Violent But Gore Can Be Removed
Great game, with mature themes.
amazing game other than very strong language
Fine for middle school kids
fun looter shooter
An amazing game! No borders in this borderlands game.
Borderlands is back baby!!!
I WILL WRITE A PARAGRAPH SO BE AWARE
Very good game.
Gory but fun
Great game but for this age
The game is violent in a very cartoonish way. It has some suggestive content and the characters swear from time to time but the only major swearing is from a character named BALEX
The game is mainly for adult because of all the pop culture references, gore, innuendos, and language, but you can change all of this by TURNING of the gore setting, putting the volume all the way down for the language, and talking to your kid about the characters and how they can be used as role models(the hero's not the villains) The game tells you to go your own path and chose your own way. This game is good if you want to take a step to let your child more free.
The Common sense reviewer admits to the games extremely overt sexual banter, but then applauds it for not discriminating against it? That's like saying "Sure, he had his pants around his ankles, but he gave a friendly hello as we walked by." There is literally a murdering contest in the game to see who gets to 'sleep with' someone with countless descriptive sexual references that are shameless and unapologetic, and this goes on throughout an entire mission. Kids have NO business playing this game and there is no option to turn it off. Nuff said. Aside from that, the majority of the time the game just desperately gets you to like it with nonstop jokes, some are funny and many of them get tired as it is a shallow, nonstop parade of pop references and bits that actually become tiresome at times. You feel some "guilt by association" along the way as you play the game and enjoy the gunfights but have to listen to the white noise of frequent juvenile nonsense. It's too bad you can't opt out of the dialogue, but there are so many cameos and celebrity voices in here that they are going to make you hear it. Like it or NO. The GOOD though. Never has there been a 'looter shooter' with so many weapons, so much of which feel very exotic, most of which you obtain through playing the main game and campaign. There is ALOT of gore, but you can turn it off and it is NOT just bugs and aliens as another reviewer said, it IS mostly humans actually. The enemy types aren't endless, but there is adequate variety and some interesting boss fights, some of which are more powerful and others more minor and simplistic, but boss enemies are a big part of the experience. The movement is fluid, traversing feels intuitive, you can pull yourself up from a half landed jump, shoot while sliding across the ground and drive several types of vehicles. so mobility is better than ever and the guns have weight and good sound to each one with alot of variety. the only downside to the gun collecting was that they are NOT upgradable and become obsolete as you level up, so you never stick to one loadout for long. So with 3 skill trees for each of the 4 characters, trinkets, and weapons perks, you will grind with meaning and noticable improvement making this one of those games you can get lost in for what you think is a few hours, then you realize you spent your day somehow. It's a genuinely fun game and I never really liked Borderlands before. It's too bad I can't wholeheartedly encourage the game with the "in your face" language and highly inappropriate, gross sex talk. As a side note, multiplayer is hard to pull off as players on different levels are rubber banded to meet in the middle for difficulty, meaning if you are the lower level player, you're going to feel pretty spongey and weak trying to keep up. Also, this game DOES have split screen 2 player, but it doesn't run as well and can be a bit laggie.
I (a 13 year old) beat the game once, and loved the game. But, there is a lot of violence, and I felt that the low tire mode didn't help too much, and even felt depressing because you see the bodies you murdered, instead of seeing a blood splat. Also there's Bakex, who constantly swears, not too concerning for anyone over 13, because NEWS FLASH kids already know and speak swear words, trust me I know. Finally there's Moxxi, it's never explicitly said to be a prostitute, but it's pretty obvious, and she has a side mission to fight for the right to sleep with a guy, which I think is no worse than the sexual remarks that go on at school. So I recommend 13+, and to parents: if your child now's about sex, swearing, and you aren't worried about violence it should be ok. One last thing is common sense doesn't say there is any positive role models, which I half agree with, but there are some upstanding kick butt girls in the game, it's not just a male dominated bullet frenzy *cough* Call Of Duty *cough*
This game is really fun, but there is a lot of violence and swearing. In the one side quest kill killavolt your goal is to kill other girls so you win the prize of being able to have sex with killavolt. They worst swearing is the b word and s word I haven't completed the game yet so I haven’t heard anything worse. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone mature enough to play and understand the topics.
I watched the original borderland games on youtube and they were pretty good, i liked the atmosphere, violence (which the gore can be turned off) weaponry, light story and nice visuals. I dont know how ease of play is it but i think it looks kinda fun. Good for teens
Borderlands 3 is a great game. It is extremely fun with a memorable art style... but there is violence... in the game you shoot many enemies but most of them are creatures like demogorgan dogs and giant insects shooting them with funny weapons such as guns that shoot burgers or other over the top, cartoony things. When you get around three hours into the game enemies like human bandits are swapped with robots. The gore can be pretty brutal but with a quick switch of a setting it is removed and the violence goes down to the level in Star Wars or destiny 2. As for the language, there is barely any. The worst words so far are hell and sh*t, but are not frequent. The story is light and a refreshing break from heavy games like the last of us, it included funny jokes such as references to defeating warlords with Vaughn’s abs (who only wears underwear and a crusty cape). Overall this is great game for anybody who can play Star Wars or destiny BUT REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE GORE!!!
The game is very gory but has options to turn off blood and guts. There is hardly any foul language in the game with few exceptions. The graphics are not realistic and are in more of a comic book style. I think that if your kids are mature enough and over 13 this game will be fine for them.
The overall point of the game is to put a stop to a cult called COV. The leaders of this cult are after a vault, which will give them weapons, and loot, and more power. Your goal is to go planet to planet to stop them from getting to the vault keys (which open the vault) There is some violence but the cartoonish style makes it not as bad. There is also a gore sensor option. What really makes this game rated M is the language. Through out the game there is about a cuss word per 5 minutes. The part where it gets the worst is with a character named Balex who uses the words: F*ck, B*tch, and Sh*t almost constantly. There is also a lot of very raunchy sexual innuendos. Overall, if you are old enough then it is an AMAZING game, but if you are to young then it could leave an impression.
It is fine for middle school kids that already know about sex and cuss words. It’s a fun game and people should not allow their kids play it if the experience worse at their school.
they tink it is the best age
Well... What can I say. It is Such a good game. I havent finished it yet, but it is so good. LOADS OF VIOLENCE THOUGH. A bit of swearing. Loads of dismemberment and blood and gore. Some humor. Some suggestive outfits.
Borderlands 3 is the fourth installment of the Borderlands franchise. With a new set of heroes, and a massive, and I mean MASSIVE variety of guns that it's crazy. Violence is frequent. You can play the game with gore on or off. Gore on: Dismemberment and frequent blood stains around the environment. Main characters jump attacks on enemies can result in a big splash of blood and gore. Gore off: Mild blood is still seen, with small bloodstains, no dismemberment. Language is occasional throughout the game. Use of "@$$", "b!#ch" "$h!t", "p!$$" and maybe two uses of "f#!k" are heard in dialogue. Sexuality is present. Some perverted innuendo and one female character's cleavage is mildly exposed. Some female characters are presented in a sexual manner.
The age of borderlands is way too high. Why is borderlands recommending to have the age of all of their games at MA15+ whereas fortnite the most competitive and addictive games with loud and swearing teens. Over the course of 10 years borderlands have upped their game where you can change the game to the way you like it starting from brightness and sensitivity to censoring gore. Therefore these games should be a lower rating.
Borderlands 3 is a fun, high octane shooter. It is violent, but if you have kids that want to play this, then no problem. You simply turn off gore by going to options, scroll down to gore, and press censored. After that, it has a little bit of blood left, but it’s the amount of blood in Overwatch. Very fun. Boss fights can be difficult though. A little bit of swearing to, but nothing like Deadpool bad.
Hello, first off this game can be mature at some points, Moxxi in particular. She wears clothing that shows most of her breasts and can say seductive things but it doesn’t go anywhere. Secondly, this game is gory, but not as bad as they make it out to be. Yes there are times when characters blows up in pools of blood and organs, but it doesn’t always happen and they use the same organ model for literally everything you kill. This game is okay for teens 13+
My relative told me about this game and told me that it’s like a game I play called destiny 2 and it was called borderlands. I played the first 2 games and then said this game seems really fun. It’s a bit on the violent side but if your kids are mature enough then let them try it out if not then don’t let them until the requirement. Some of the cursing is blocked in some parts. Gore splatters sometimes on the screen. If you parents are fine with your kids playing this game then go ahead.
