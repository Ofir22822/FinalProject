Not as bad as it says
Not as bad.
Peice of TRASH!!!
Boring
Not to bad for children
You want your kids to be exposed to
Parents need to know that game-breaking glitches plague this dissapointing game. If you have played Fallout 4 then you know what to expect from this game. However, Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game. I usually really like MMO games and survival post-appocalyptic games, but this was a dissapointment. Even if you decide to play it, you should be warned about the content. Violence is pretty frequent and graphic, with heads and limbs being shot off. Combat is almost required to survive and progress. The game also includes occasional strong language with uses of f--k and s--t and a few sexual references. If you are an adult then I reccomend that you play Fallout 4 instead. If you are a kid or young teen then I reccomend that you stay away from this one. It isn't worth your time. I hope that Bethesda (the game developers) can do better with the next Fallout game. This game had lots of potential.
This Is a very good game, my kid has wanted to play fallout 4 for a while but that game unlike this one was to violent and not appropriate. I found that this game was a good alternative because it is the sequel to Fallout 4 and I do not see any problems with it, in my opinion this game should be Rated Teen and not M.
The Good: Fallout 76's content is very simple and easy to understand. Your kids will have a good time exploring a massive map with others. There is no sexual content, and the sense of freedom is high. The Bad: Fallout 76 is filled with profanity, though the F-bomb is not dropped very often, thankfully. The violence is high, as there is a plethura of weapons and explosives to use. The landscape is filled with mutated creatures and evil robots who will try to exterminate you. Friendly NPCs can be killed for little more than fun. The Ugly: Fallout 76 is an online only game, and therefore kids and people alike will experience other people's choices, like swearing over online chat, underdressing or dressing immodestly, and straight up murdering you for fun. The Verdict: I recommend this for teenagers and Adults which understand that this is not real, and are mature enough to not repeat actions experienced in the game in the real world.
Whilst Fallout 76 on the surface appears violent, it isn't always about violence. There are some times when you engage in combat purely to survive but it becomes the message that the game plays. On occasions the player will kill "Scorched" and "feral ghouls" who were humans but they don't have any higher brain function which to some extent is deemed murder. The game does contain a voice chatting function but it can be controlled in the settings. Overall the game is violent but it is mainly due to a VERY MATURE background which it can be best to talk to kids about or whether they ask questions about certain elements of the game. I would suggest that the person playing this game can be very mature about the content they experience within the game.
If you want you child to be able to play a fallout game let them play any game but this. Fallout 4 and New Vegas were awesome and very child friendly, but this one was hot trash. It also killed corn dogs.
Well first of all i am 12 and have it......ITS NOT AS BAD AS 4! The community is also very nice
i have played all the fallout games and i am a god at them if you need a tutor this is me on dicord ortega234 and me on xbox live statedevening71 but lets talk about fallout 76 it has blood and gore it got more hard couse its online the gameplay is allot more wack but its good
The game has some violence but is totally fine. My first grade student played with his older siblings and loved it! He used it ashas main source for his science project on nuclear warfare. His gravely unenlightened teacher told him his project was unrealistic. I had to go in and explain how nuclear bombs are real!
Fallout 76 met a very controversial launch back in 2018 (for good reason), however, since then a number of updates have hit the game, improving it to a playable state yet still showing it has flaws. The game itself takes place in the Fallout universe, an alternate-history post-apocalyptic world where your role is to... well... survive. As with all fallout games, it is pretty violent; an array of guns and melee weapons can be used to shoot and beat opponents, often resulting in bloody battles with limbs and heads occasionally being blown off the opponents. The combat does have a slightly goofy edge to it, making it not feel highly realistic and so more appropriate for teens. With the new dialogue system, there is occasional swearing; ‘f**k, s**t, d**k’ etc. however nothing too offensive nor overly frequent. Alcohol and drugs can be taken, however they have more comical rather than realistic side effects. The online aspect of the game does expose you to other players, however the community is mostly very kind/supportive and it can be easily ignored if you wish to play solo. The game still suffers from issues, such as weaker side quests and characters, in comparison to its predecessors, however it is now a much more competent and somewhat fun title good for teens 14 and up
Unlike the rest of the fallout franchise they FINALLY removed NPC's! I now have next to no interaction in the game because nobody likes me, unlike elder scrolls online which sucks because it has NPC's
I think people 12 and over can play Fallout 76 as you need to work as a team to survive but is quite vulgar and gory that should not be a huge problem though it is not as gory as previous fallout games
This Game Is Good -Fat Abbot- 2019
You can turn off the blood so it is not violent plus over all it is not much difference to skyrim
They've fixed a lot of the bugs and added in a battle royal mode. The community is nice, the game is entertaining, and it's worth checking out if you haven't already. It's definitely worth it. I am level 70 (In Adventure mode) at the moment, but I know people who are level 200+. They're constantly adding updates and stuff to the shop to keep the game fun, this isn't a game that you just beat and put back on your shelf.
I have played this game and think it fine for anyone mature enough to handle slight blood and occasional cursing. My kids have heard much worse at school and sports so why not let them play a fun strategic video game when they hear worse daily?
This game has some graphic detail, not much though, it also great gameplay and should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 12. It's not as violent as they say. I watched my 2 kids play this game, they had fun interactin g with the game and I have to say it did look good!
I thought when this game was first announced that it be great, but BOI was I wrong. Bethesda should be ashamed of their greedy selfs and quit being game developers. This game is buggy and unfinished, its like they only did it for the money. SKIP THIS TRASH
There are beliefs that there is prostitution in this game that is far from the truth to be honest it’s not that bad it just has weird looking creatures because it was set after the apocalypse.
Fallout 76
Not as bad as you would think for your child
Buggy...
Violent, and frankly not worth your money
Fun for the Whole Family
Lol
Not too bad
Not as many bad words as it says
I am a jewish father who believes that games are not good until inspected and reviewed. Fallout 76 is almost like watching a pg13 movie i think that the games curses are minimal and can be cut out it is a shooting game so there is a decent amount of blood but on a 1 to 10 ratio i rate it a 7in violence and gore on the scale of a pg13 movie more or less i suggest you filter out bad language. their is no nudity or sex so i suggest to other parents buying this gift for chanuckah to keep this in mind overall a great game 13 plus
THE GAME IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT VIOLENT! There is not sex or nudity whatsoever and gore can be turned down. I think it would be a great fit as long as your kid is mature and trustworthy
It is a pretty bad game and if your kid wants to get it should be fine but it is a complete waste of money.
Violent, gory, etc. For a mature rated game, not too bad, but definitely quite a bit for young children. Also comes with typical online game variability in voice chat content. Worst of all, the devs did not encrypt any content so personal IP adresses are at risk. It's also not a great game. You're better off buying its' predecessor, Fallout 4.
My little one had a blast playing this game! The only bad part was the scarceness of the mutated moles. They were a little bit intense, but not too much. If your child is looking for a game to play, I would get this for them, it is on sale for Black Friday. On the downside, when you get hurt, your character shows blood, which I was not expecting. Overall I loved the game!
There is a little bit of cursing but not much, the violence is definetley there, but it is nothing close to other gory and bloody games. It may be too mature for a 10 year old or so but nothing a teenager can’t handle. The game is an immersive expierence and you can play with friends. The drug reference is also very subtle. The rating on this website is a little too much for violence and drugs, there is hardly any of it.
If any fallout 4 had about 4 bad words and I have yet to hear any in the game. There is a little blood but its not that bad
Spyro-portal to past
7+
4+
The main Spyro the Dragon was delivered in 1998: by the norms of those years, Insomniac made an advancement game. The motor created by the studio permitted to attract all items two forms: with a significant level of detail and with a low one, contingent upon the separation of the article from the player. These days, such procedures are utilized all over, yet then Spyro was one of the principal games in which they executed something like this.

I played the original of these games and loved them back then The reignited trilogy has been overhauled and looks amazing compared to the older versions. As I was playing my four year old was watching and asked to have a go She started off not being very good as she is only 4 after all but she has now gone on to complete all 3 games. Normally I wouldn’t recommend many games for 4 year olds but she managed to pick it up very easily.
It's not as bad as you think
Violence
Ok game, but deserves a lower age rating.
Pretty good
This Is amazing
Stealth, Strategy, Puzzle Game with some Gore
Hitman 2: A "Mature" Game
The game is pretty epic.
It’s not 18+
Underrated
teen cool
If your kid likes puzzle and action games GO FOR IT!!!
Love it!
Not bad just a little violent
My 13 year old son is not allowed 18s but after a lot of research i found out its actually not that bad. I also learned that you can turn of bad language and blood so it makes it a teen rated game. So i let him install it and i watched him play and it it way better than i thought as there is actually not much gun use at all.
This Game has a little bit of swearing including the f and s word There is also some smoking and drinking but what really concerns me is the drug Factory in Columbia. If you get the free addition there is no Drug factory but that is still pretty violent. There is not much blood and I expected from the front cover for it to be gory but actually there is no gore and you can turn off blood.
Why is the rating so high? This game is just fine for kids 12 and older. The violence isnt bad because players are encouraged to avoid killong exept for the targets. The language and talk, they have heard of plenty of at school by this age. The game isnt the most fun, but my son likes it. I think it deserves a lower age rating.
Although the game has some gore, its somewhat situational, and its really not bad for anyone thats mature enough. The other references oin the game are no worse than the things that are heard at school everyday. I think that the official rating is way to high. Overall, this is a great game.
Its ok for kids the idea is cool and you can take at bad guys blood isn't too bad not as bad as Rainbow Six Seige. My Son Zach loves it and he's 11!
HITMAN 2 is a stealth game where you have to assassinate targets. There is some gore, basically just blood when you kill someone. You can go around and kill everyone, but that’s difficult, so it’s recommended to be stealthy, so you aren’t exposed to anything bad. I let my son play this game when he was 10, as he was mature, but I think that’s about an appropriate age. There is some alcohol in the levels, and also some cocaine in some missions. If your child cannot handle any drugs, you might want to wait to let them play. Swearing is rare but some light swearing happens occasionally. Five star rating for the game, 11+ age rating
Hitman 2 is not what Common Sense Media (referred to as CSM in the rest of this article) paints it as. It's not the greatest game in the world but I've enjoyed it, and it's not as mature as it says it says. I'll address some of the issues and solutions in the following: As for Agent 47, his morals are technically wrong, but you as the audience are aware of that. Do the ends justify the means? That's for you and your child to decide. It's super easy to play, the tutorial in Hawke's Bay teaches all you need to know about the game and exploring the game further is as easy as watching a video from creator MrFreeze2244. He has slowly transitioned away from Hitman as a whole, but his content is engaging, with some swears here and there. I'll talk more about the swearing later. The game features grotesque blood, but here's how to fix the blood issue: You can't exactly fix it without going in the game (for which you'd have to decompile and create some form of mod, and if you're reading this you don't have the technical knowledge to do), but you can try to limit it. Blood only appears in the game when someone is shot with a pistol so it wouldn't be too hard to try to limit their use of the gun. As for "sex", it's not sex. It's 2 levels with swimsuits in them. The swearing is a little excessive but by age 13 the entire genre of swearing is covered. Drinking is a semi-big portion of Hitman 2 but it's portrayed in every level in a minor manner and as a poison ability, drugs are only shown in certain levels as pills in cabinets, cocaine (fellow posters may take issue with the Santa Fortuna level being focused on cocaine but there is a level containing cocaine. In specifics it's the third floor of the New York building), and smoking is infrequently shown but there are cigar boxes in Isle of Sgail and Whittleton Creek, the latter being more prominent. Consumerism is a semi-big issue because there are only 2 levels locked off with the Gold and Silver expansions (which also contain suits and items that are essentially useless, you can play the base game and unlock their equivalents): New York and Haven Island. It's $20 more for those two levels but they are not important to the story. I clicked "Safety and privacy concerns" because the game has to be online 24/7 in order for DRM. Playing it offline prevents progression in levels, which prevents the ability to unlock loadouts and such. Big issue and their Privacy Policy is a little pervasive. However, speaking with IOI there are ways to opt-out. Should 18+ play it only? No. It's a violent game but it's not going to cause another mass shooting. CSM is reacting improperly. This is due to the fault of the reviewer, who didn't play the game at all and wrote this article in order to get money. This website should be 18+ because of the lies on it, and H2 is just one on their hitlist.
Rated 18+ for strong bloody violence, language and drug references.
its pretty epic
Good action
It barely has blood/gore (there’s not any gore) It should have 10-12+ rating plus only some swearing
This game is without a doubt, the best hitman game in the franchise. Should kids play it? Depends on the kid. There Are some dialogs from NPCs that include swearing. If your kid is able to handle snapping necks, dumping bodies and other creative ways to eliminate your targets, he/she can play it. Also there is missions that include stealing joints, and breaking into a drug factory.
hitman and hitman 2 are teen ready there is a few times where they lead drinks wine but unless your kid does not know about it it's fine
Depends if your kid can handle violence in video games and movies GO FOR IT!!! There is a bit of swearing but it’s not a lot.
Love this game and it does have violence swearing however if your child is 10 or up they will have heard all of these before at school there is no sexual content in the game great game and definitely consider buying it for your child if they are mature enough Common Sense Media rates everything to high don't listen to them
I think the game is great nothing really bad about it all tho the game is a little violent. But the violince is not as bad as the rest of the stuff you see now so consider before you buy.
