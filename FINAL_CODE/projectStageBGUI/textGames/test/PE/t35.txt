Bad csm review
yes it is fun but, it is not for kids under 14 years old
Really good
Fun just turn off blood
You can turn of most of the blood but still some and highly intense can turn off language YOU HAVE TO TURN ON DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION
Amazing game super fun. It has role models as in police and millatry saving civilians. Suicide bombers some desturbing scenes they lock suicide vest on innocent man and we get him but he can't be saved and is pushed over edge while begging and screaming . When sniping of u hit someone the thing you hit will explode. Swearing is sh** fu** and bas**rd.
So the age you should be to play the game all depends on if your playing multiplayer or campaign. If your playing multiplayer it should be about 10+ but campaign is a solid 13+ due to heavy violence
The new Modern Warfare is possibly one of the most morally disturbing video games I’ve played. The game tackles very serious war questions such as where the you should cross the line when it comes to what must be done. However, gameplay wise, this is one of my favorite games from 2019. This game is like sort of like R6 and is more strategic, while still having the face-paced combat of Call of Duty. When it comes to picking a good age for this game, it depends on what you’re child can take. The disturbing acts of terrorism depicted most likely will have an impact on kids, so it really depends. Violence: Being a first person shooter expect modern wartime violence including stabbing, shooting, and exploding with blood and sometimes gore. Every shot leads to spurting blood and the characters make very disturbing sounds of pain and role frantically. Depending on what weapons you use limbs can be dismembered including heads, they will explode into blood and chunks. This usually only happens with heavy snipers though, so it’s a somewhat rare occurrence. You can stab enemies resulting in blood. Sometimes you get the chance to execute engines and this usually leads to you stabbing an enemy through the neck or body, spurting blood. Explosions lead to blood and maybe gore (I couldn’t tell). There are many types of throwables such as deaf Fernandez and Molotov cocktails. Molotovs catch engines on fire and you can watch as they rithe in pain. However this is not the extent of the violence. On the campaign, many of the missions follow terrorist attacked ehoch are shown in full view. Women and children are killed onscreen. Attacks include bombings, mass destruction, and murders to name a few. In missions you can kill civillians, they encourage you not to but sometimes you can. Some cutscenes are interactive and you can chose to torture a man. This is no where near the extent of this form of violence due to spoilers, but just so you know, very few of any cutscenes include gore. Language: In cutscenes and dialogue includes frequent use of f—k, s—t, p—-y and more. Unmonitored voice and type chat can teach you’re kids some words or phrases you might not want you’re 9 year old saying around the house. Consumption: Alcohol and smoking are used sometimes throughout. Profile pictures include shown references to drugs. Sex: Very infrequent minor sexual talk. As referenced above some profile photos include some imagery related to nudity, but nothing other than somewhat exposed buttocks are shown. Extra: User generated and some game made profile pictures include imagery including animated photos of cannabis and drugs, sexual imagery and exposed buttocks. Role models and messages are very vague to to the story.
This game is violent but you can enjoy it if you mature enough to handle it, Tje campaign includes swears like F*ck in diffrent sentences Sh*t and Hell
So... This Game When I Dusted Off The Disc And Put It On Campaign, Captain Price Brought Me Memories, Honestly This Game Is The Best Out Of The Franchise(Im Kidding) But There Is A lot Of Swearing So Watch Out For That(And On The Mission When Alex Is In A Desert There Is Something Too Disturbing)
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 is a great game. It contains positive messages, such as "A single trigger pull can change a life, and end a life" and "Every choice you make can have massive consequences". It also contains admirable role models, like Captain Price, a man willing to get his hands dirty to save as many lives as possible, like in one instance near the beginning of the game, when he throws a civilian who had a bomb vest on(and was seconds away from going off) over a railing to save other hostages. There are many choices in the Campaign, such as in the first mission, Fog Of War, where you approach an enemy gas factory that was just hit by an airstrike(that you called in). As you enter, you watch as soldiers that are being burned alive crawl towards you. You can either shoot them or watch as they are slowly, painfully expire. Another choice is in the fifth mission of the game, Clean House, where you enter a room and find a woman. She rushes over to the back of the room, terrified. She is rushing towards a baby in a crib, which starts to cry. She comforts it if you spare her, but if you shoot her, you're guaranteed to be full of guilt. If you shoot the woman, the baby awakens and begins to cry, as one of your fellow soldiers tries to comfort it, and its wailing continues, a sorrowful reminder of what you just did. The final choice I will discuss is in one of the last missions, Old Comrades, where you are interrogating one of the game's villains, the Butcher. You bring in his family, and Captain Price gives you a pistol, and the Butcher tries to reason with you, and you're forced to pull the trigger, but the weapon clicks, out of ammo. Price hands you ammunition, and the Butcher begins to talk. You're able to then shoot the Butcher(you aren't forced to), and if you do, his family begins to sob, another reminder of your wrongdoing. Besides the choices, the campaign is a mix between tame and mature. I recommend 13+ are able to play it, but the rest of the game is appropriate for 10+(if they are somewhat mature). The Multiplayer isn't that bad, yes, you may hear the occasional f bomb from the Operators, but as long as you're focused on the gameplay, there isn't the need to worry. Warzone is much the same, but requiring much more strategy than just going in guns blazing. The first time that you die in a match, you're taken to the Gulag, where you fight another prisoner for a second chance, while other prisoners watch and pelt you with rocks, this is, no doubt, the most mature part of Warzone, but it isn't as mature as the Campaign. Finally, Spec-Ops AKA Co-op. There isn't much to talk about in Classic Spec Ops, because it's mostly just a few minigames. There are many more things to talk about in the Operations , though. the Operations are very difficult and frustrating at times, but as long as you have a capable team, you can manage. The story is pretty good(I'm counting the Spec Ops story and the Season Cutscene story as one entity), telling a story of a faction comprised of two smaller factions that don't trust each other that much taking down the chain of command of a terrorist faction but ultimately ripping itself apart, leaving an elite task force to continue where they left off. All in all, Modern Warfare 2019 is a good game that anyone at the age of 10 or more can enjoy
This is a Call Of Duty game - nothing you'll see in this is different from anything you will see in any other. The campaign is using modern war events to tell a story on the horrors of war. There is a lot of death and blood. You are going around and taking out the bad guys like you do in every COD campaign. There is some incredibly dark stuff in this one though. Literal torture, children being shot, children fighting soldiers. No one under the age of about 14 could probably understand and handle what it is putting out. The multiplayer is a different story. It's the basic mindless arcade shooter that we all know. It's probably good for any one over the age of 10. Turn off the gore in settings, and you'll be fine.
I believe most of the REALLY bad or disturbing stuff happens in the campaign which attempts to showcase the horrors of modern wars. The violence in the multiplayer modes and warzone is not as bad and those modes are where the 13 and up comes from. The only bad parts in these modes are some rare swearing, a little red mist like blood that dissapears a second later, and limp bodies after players die. So, i say get the warzone only mode(it's free) if your kid wants to play but isn't old enough for the campaign.
Amazing game for young teens with no sex but be warned that there is drugs and alcohol with strong language so if you played Batman Arkham Knight you should not have any problems with this game
This game is good if your kids understand what is happening. There is multiple scenes of peril and when civilians are shot, but take away that and you have a fun military shooter.
So I would say that a kid 5+ could play COD but only Multiplayer but Campaign or CO-OP then that 8-9-10+ so it’s a good game but in Multiplayer you can learn a bit. Example: When your sniping at someone but they are sniping at you at the same time then there scope flashes even if your not sniping. But they’re is blood and if your playing Warzone there is something called Plunder and I think they changed the name but you kill people and can get money or open crates and get money and give it to a helicopter but Battle Royale is Fortnite but will allot more to it like guns,blood,and more.
Before you read this review, consider this: what are you buying the game for? The campaign, or the multiplayer? The campaign is for sure what bags this game the age rating it has, as scenes of genocide and terrorism are present in it's 5-6 hour run time. It's pretty heavy. But if you believe that's fine for your kid, then go for it, you know them better than anyone (assumedly). If what you're getting it for is the multiplayer, then the age is much less relevant. The multiplayer is low on violence besides shooty shooty bang bang boom, and the minimal blood and gore effects present can be turned off. The multiplayer is where the game's value really comes in, so if the campaign's content bothers you, don't write off the game just yet. Look into the multiplayer yourself to finalise your opinion.
I don't want to be the kid that rates the game higher than my own age so I am putting 13+. Game has gore, but that could be turned off. Mainly fear themes are the problem but I you have a kid who understands that it happens in the world, then you should be fine. Language is nothing a kid 12+ hasn't been exposed to.
One thing I have to say first is that I don't really like CoD games at all, the only other ones I actually like are WaW and IW. I'm rating this an 18+ mainly for the campaign, but for Multiplayer I'd rate it a 15+ and Warzone is a 13+. This game is actually incredible and the characters and story-telling are phenomenal. Overall rating: 9.5/10 and 5/5 stars. 18+ for Frequent strong bloody violence, war horror, threat, gore and language
This may be a bit biased, but I think 11 and up is a good age range to allow kids to play this. I started playing COD (Call of Duty) around the age of 2 (Bio dad was a Marine and this was his escape) and I would often play with him. I realized that kids weren't allowed to play it once I started school, but once I hit around 5th, kids were always asking to play one COD game or another. As long as you remind your kid that you shouldnt (for some kids, the word cant would be better) do this in real life and that its only just a game. If you hear them trash talking on Multiplayer with friends or just fellow gamers, dont stress, it only makes the game more hype and exciting (bear in mind, if your kid is sensative, don't let them play online until you think they have grown some thick skin, COD is one extremely toxic game - may have cooled down since I last played COD last). I also suggest playing video games with your kids even if you have no clue, it creates memories for both of you and is a blast. 5 start game.
Why is this 18+. Not nearly as bad as some Tom Clancy shooters, violent but not overly bloody and gory
Hi I am just here to let you all know that the campaign in this game can be very hard hitting because you do play as a kid with a gun killing people. other than that I think this is a fun game with a fun multiplayer but play the campaign with your kids because is has moments where it left me wondering how this is on the market today. So yes this game should be for kids over 14 if they play campaign or just don't install the campaign. also if someone is reading this and thinking I am just a hater on this game well I have 100 hours on this game. sorry for any errors I made I just don't care to fix them
It is fine you can turn off button swearing. I do think that the campaign or story mode is like it has actual war stuff. So if your kid can’t handle like some stuff were it is like. A little dark and kind of scary. there is auto subtitles which it will say the bad words you can turn off gore but it doesn’t turn off blood completely instead of body parts flying around it’s just one body but they still when ever you shoot them they bleed. Nothing sexuality what so ever also no drug use other than just smoking.
Very fun I reccomend
