Overwatch is possibly one of the best titles out right now. While it is an FPS game, it’s not overly violent. Few things to look out for. - one character, Mcree, smokes a cigar, - some female characters (Widowmaker and dva) have skintight outfits which may be to inappropriate for some children. Finally, please don’t let you child go on voice chat. Regardless of how well you think little Timmy can handle swearing, people on overwatch voice chat are very creative when comes to insults. People usually are in voice chat in competitive games, so maybe steer clear of those. Overall, it’s great game for the price, and with overwatch 2 right around the corner, it’s a great time to get used to the characters, and the feel of the game.
Ok look, the game has violence with cartoon-like guns. The worst in this game is a slight amount of blood when you shoot people, but I literally never notice it. There's some dudes smoking, but nothing illegal. This game screams family-family. If you let your kid play this game, they won't get angry and lash out, unlike what the media says, so it's fine. But it's really addictive, and there ARE ways to pay extra for loot boxes, but it isn't as prevalent as in games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Anyways, if you can find this game for $30 bucks like I did (and with extra content!), this is a buy. Even if it's still the normal price of $60, buy it. But just to know, if you play on Console (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo), you have to pay a monthly fee for this game, because it's online only. $10 a month for PlayStation and Xbox, $5 for Nintendo. Thanks for reading this review!
I dont think that this game should be 14 and up. This game is amazing for all ages. Obviously there is a lot of violence in games like this, but it is not too graphic. there is no sex at all. "oh no! A female character has a big butt! what shall we ever do?!" Thats what yall sound like! There are many female characters so sexism is pretty much non-existant in this game. Dont let a 3 year old play it! But don't try to shield it from a 12 year old!
This game is super fun and not addictive. The reason kids are acting bad is because the parents let them play to much. I play this game and have fun every time. The only down side is the voice chat, but can easily disabled in settings. Parents overreact to overwatch. If your kid’s behavior is changing just limit play time, don’t blame it on the game. This game has a very minimal amount of in game purchases.
Overwatch is a futuristic first person shooter with positive role models and messages with little to no blood. I bought this game about two years ago and had great fun with my mates. There are more than enough gamemodes to keep you interested, you can have a good time playing custom games and creating them yourself. I stopped playing this game about a year ago because the community can be very toxic sometimes and some players who you play with can be very aggressive. You can also buy in-game loot boxes which are incredibly overpriced. Please do not waste your money on them!! But overall a great game with some flaws.
I love the game overwatch! It is an online first person shooter, however, it is not as violent as other FPS games such as call of duty and Doom (2016). There is minimal blood however it is a lot of violence. There are guns and you half to shoot at other players but that is not the point of the game. The point of the game is to capture the objective and keep that objective until the end of the game! There is mild language, a character will say d**n occasionally! Other than that this is a great game for teens! Side note: You should turn your microphone off because some people will get very angry.
It is a really good game that shows diversity through race, gender, sexuality, and body type. The characters are very good! There is the rare 'damn' from a character, which isn't really a bad word. The game play is simple, and can be fun to get better at. There are some skin tight suits, but that is in all super heros (marvel and dc) The only thing that you should do is mute voice chat for your kid. Let them play with friends on vc, but never with strangers. Sure there are nice people, but it still can be very toxic. I've avoided people and I really like it. Also monitor what your kid sees in the fandom. There is cool art and comics but also... you know... stuff. But its not the same as playing the game
The whole point of the game is to be in a 6v6 where you have to attack or defend points, payloads, or hold a point. In colorful maps and loads of vibrant customizable heroes with there own unique skills, it is truly a wonderful game (sometimes rage inducing) that can make you say “hey, where did the last 5 hours go?” Violence: The only shred of violence is when you kill a character, tiny cartoony drops of blood come out. That’s only it. Language: Sometimes the characters will say “damn” every once in a while. It is open chat, but you can turn it off. Nudity: Some characters are shirtless (boys only) and some are in tube tops (girls only) Positive messages: The only positive message is that communication and team work can help you win more games, and it teaches you need to be strategic in when to go in, when to use your abilities, etc. Drugs/Alcohol/Smoking: Sometimes one character (who’s a cowboy) chews tobacco rarely. And one spray a girl is drinking wine (She’s in her twenties) That’s it. Takeaway: Great game that might be to complicated for kids under 8, and might be rage inducing, there is open chat but it can be turned off.
For me, in my opinion that is, this game is atleast 10+. Why? This game has no violence, actually no blood - there is a little blood when you punch somebody and that's it. It's a shooter game so obviously it involves guns, but this shooter game isn't as mature as others, like Call of Duty or Rainbow Six Siege. I'm 13 and have been playing this game since I was 11. It has some toxic players, but that's where you just got to mute the toxic people and move on. It isn't hard. If you don't want your child talking to older kids, just don't get a mic for them. As for 'sexual content' the only thing I can really think of it a character named Widowmaker. Her bodysuit shows some parts of her breasts, but there is skins for her that you can get that cover up those parts. There isn't swearing, atleast not horrible swearing. One character has a cigar presented in game. So get this game for your kids if you're considering it. It's very fun. To me it is age 10+, but if you are a strict parent, then maybe 12+. Just make sure your kid is mature enough! :)
I think that mature content-wise, this is the same as Fortnite. Fortnite is a 12+ so I think that Overwatch should be as well. It is a good game and very fun to play.
This game is a copy of TF2 but less bloody. Literally all 9 classes in TF2 have classes just like them in this game. Accuse me of salty but if you have seen both games you'll know what I mean.
Overwatch is a fantastic game based on a 6 VS 6 game mode with different modes within. You can do competitive play, where you can claim your skill rating to show off to other players, you can jump into a 10 minute game called QUICK PLAY, and you can make your own game of parkour, hide and seek and many more. There is a lot of violence but in a good way, as the game is good for strategy and quick thinking. You need good hand-eye co-ordination for quick reactions on the keyboard or controller. There is little language, but some heroes say "Damn", and "Hell". One specific hero (Tracer) says "Wanker" which is a politer word for asshole when she is wearing a specific skin (Punk). There is no sex, but Widowmaker (the main sniper) does a sort of ballet dance, and you can see her knickers. Several female heroes are scantily-clad, including some skins are just a bikini or crop top. You can join groups to group up and you can join group chat, team chat and match chat to chat to people so you can co-ordinate your attacks (This option can be switched off). Great role models to fight for the greater good of the world, and is very easy to play and use. The hero backgrounds are amazing and if you watch the short cinematics on YouTube, you can find out everything. There are in-game purchases with credits you can find in loot boxes, and you can buy loot boxes with real money if you want to. One specific hero, McCree, is always shown smoking a cigar, with a little smoke rising from it. Overall a brilliant game and I hope people consider my review, even though I am only a kid.
I think that this game is much better than fortnite and that the only reason that there is any smoking points on this is because there is a cowboy character that has a cigarette. He doesn't even have it in the game, just in the cinematic. Also, maybe there is some revealing things on a certain character, but it's very harmless and just don't pay attention. Just be wary of voice chat on PC, but not so much on console. Toxicity is abundant. Just be wary of voice chat in this game. Here is how toxicity is in that game. Toxic_33: omg ur so bad get off this game! Stupid bronze scum. Everyone else: k Also if you play competitive, please at least use the communication wheel and don't play if you aren't gonna take it seriously. Also don't instalock someone that you don't need. You might get flamed. Please don't main bastion. Please don't main Mei either. Also if you are gonna be sad about your rank, because you are a support in bronze, 50% of the time its because you main Moira and dont heal. Just remember that you can get good if you try and play more. Also play good characters.
I Got This For My 9th Birthday And There Is Nothing In It Compared To Movies As a DISNEY Movie Has More Gore Than This (POTC) Sure People Can Be Toxic But Same Could Be Said For Any Game And I Get That I Am a Kid But Minecraft Could Get a Older Rating Because Of a Toxic Community And Most Parents Let Their Kids Play Games Like COD And Halo Which Halo Is Rated The Same (Teen) So Think About It Like That
this game is amazing. all you other parent are wrong, the violence is very mild. as for the consumerism, it would be OK to let you child buy a few loot boxes, but dont let them spend 600$ on your credidt card. overall great game.
It is a really fun game with hardly any blood and violence. If you want to play a shooter game that is appropriate, then ask your parents to play Overwatch! There are also special abilities that makes the game really unique
Overwatch is a great 3D FPS Shooter. It is great fun to play especially when you are in a team! The game is 90% team play. It encourages it alot which is good. The only thing that someone may see bad (I don't really know how as it's extremely mild.) When you are on low health there is not so realistic blood around the screen and some characters have tight suits (I dont see this as a problem) Any kid over the age of 7 will see the violence is purley SCI-FI. There is no other blood.
Very fast pace game with lots of violence (no blood) e.g. later guns, pistols, maces and many more weapons. Has an open chat which will help you win with communication. But no that bad in terms of violence.
This is a great game I mean I love it I’ve played it since I was 10, it’s fine guns are bad but this is animated it doesn’t even look real... this game would be good for a 10 year old if they were mature but if they’re not by 11 it’ll be fine for them, the reason I say this is the overwatch community is quite toxic and can get a little mad when you lose a competitive game but you just gotta move on. In conclusion this game is really fun and parents if you’re not sure just try it for yourself.
This has been a defining game of the 21st century. While the game didn't blow up quite as much as Fortnite, I has been able to maintain its high popularity for 4 years. Overwatch is a team based FPS with an open mic. Before you join a server, you pick what type of player you can choose when you enter the match (attacker, tank, or healer). When you enter a game, you select your character of choice from the options given to your class. There are several game modes, but most of them fall under these categories: king of the hill, escort the payload, and team deathmatch. The violence isn't bad in the slightest, when players die they disappear and there is no blood or gore when a player gets hurt. The reason I rated the age for 11 and up is because of the hot mic. It is open voice chat, like if you've ever played teams in fortnite, and people can pretty much say anything they want to. This could scar some younger children for life, so I recommend turning off the microphone feature and muting other players if you are a parent of a younger child. But other than that, it is a very good game that has so many different character options that it is hard to dislike the game.
