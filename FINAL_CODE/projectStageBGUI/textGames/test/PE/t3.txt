Horrible game.
Same as other call of duty games.
Call of duty Modern Warfare.. why its not that bad
Needs a powerful machine but is still a great experience.
Not as bad as you think
Please read this.
It is not 18+
Gore can be turned off, gamechat can be turned off.
multiplayer is fine campaign 17+
Amazing gameplay. Gives role models that most games can’t replicate.
Too scary for my 8 year old, 10 year old was fine
Great Game

Definitely suitable for 13* kids.
Great game

AMAZING MY KID LOVES THIS GAME!!!
THE MEDIA IS WRONG
I it is a fun game and not bad and everyone should play it
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and rate games on common sense media.org. I noticed that commonsense media consists of many fake parent reviews and I want to start a movement for change. Please check my reviews on popular games, for trustworthy and informative reviews. This game is just like any other call of duty game. Same game every year. There is frequent profanity throughout including f**k, s**t, hell, damn, b*tch, and bastard. language is 8/10. Violence is constant, gore can be turned off. All shots result in some blood and RARELY dismemberment. Blood can barely be seen from far.(sometimes it can't) This game as always will get a 13+.
I personally have taken time with my 11 y/o and my 14 y/o to play this game. We have one day a week that we play against each other, and have endless amounts of fun! Now about the gameplay and the violence... when you eliminate someone, its not like blood comes GUSHING OUT. There is a tiny bit of blood that drips onto the ground. The game has little swearing, and if swearing is a big deal to you and your family, I suggest turning the volume off so that you don't hear it at all. As far as roll models go, it has many. You are mainly a British Armed Forces soldier fighting off terrorist attacks in the campaign mode. I don't see the harm in that. It is teaching people what is right and wrong, and teaching kids about our world. An educational aspect of the game is, it teaches you a lot about guns. I myself just from playing with my children, have learned numerous guns, the country and military that uses them, and many many things about forgein militaries. There is no sexual content what so ever. I hope as a fellow parent, this helps you out.
M rated I don't think so. There is legit no gore and the blood is barely noticeable. Also, there is a setting called the turn of blood and gore which I told my kids to put, and they where like ok it doesn't matter there is no disadvantage. Yes, this is a shooter but shooters aren't unhealthy. Finally, the price I know this is a full-priced game costing 80 dollars Canadian and the game never goes on sale but for what you get its worth it. You get a full stories mode that will last at least a couple of weeks if you are very good at the game and at least 20 different game modes that change every week witch creates more of a diversity of things to do. to completely master the game it will take more than a year so 80 bucks of a year of gaming is yes for me and should be the same for you.
At first my 14 year old son asked me for this game and I said no as it was rated 18+ and I thought it was violent. However after he told me that he could handle it I realised that I should take a look at it and put my self in his shoes to see if it would effect him. It’s not as bad as you think and although yes it does have blood in it I think some parents forget that (especially if they are a teen like mine) they aren’t a little kid anymore and as long as they have a loving family and home, will be fine.
In the campaign, it is violent, lots of curse words(f and s mostly), and bloody. It has a good story though. The multiplayer is not nearly as violent, and so much fun. You can customize weapons and have cool camps on them. There is a couple of calling cards that are bad. There’s 1 where it has a girl saying da f***, but that’s the only bad one, and is simi rare to see. Warzone is just like multiplayer in bad stuff but it is a battle royal game mode. Over all the game is one of my favorites and could be handeled by mature 11 year olds, but the Campaign should be played at 13+. Note that you can now disable the campaign. Just watch a video on it.
I think is a violent game but is not for 18+ I think 12+ Little bit bad words. violence but its enought to 12 years old kids.
Some other adults are saying that gamechat and gore etc isnt good for your child, you can easily turn it off in settings, i would much recommend maybe 12 to 13. story mode 14 plus as it is gory swears often and is a bit old for children, if your child wants this game they probably want it to play with friends, it is a blast with friends and if you were to say no to them then theyd probably be missing out on fun with friends, after all lockdown can get boring
campign is the only bad part of this game the filters for blood and violence are a great addition. campaign is 17+ and the rest of game is 13+ in my opinion
I think most parents know that CSM overacts on games. Have you found one MA rated game on this app rated anything but 18. No you haven’t. So how about listen to a parent of three kids instead of them. I went to Oxford University if you are one of those parents that says “Oh he’s just some rando.” Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has positive role models, the campaign is about a anti-terrism organization working against a terrorist. Violence- this can be switched off easily in settings. Without it switched off there are some very gory instances. Language- Can also be switched off. Without it switched off there are a few occasional f-bombs and s-words and a other cus words. Suicide bombing part never killed anyone, you kill the bomber and defuse the bomb jacket. Some smoking and drinking, but I think a twelve year old has seen people drink and smoke. Sex- none of that. I have two sons and a daughter. I bought this for my son because he said you could switch off the bad stuff. Turns out you can. I’m normally against single shooters because I saw a bunch of studies on how they affect children, but the shooting is against terrorists and you are saving people. You are told to not kill unless they are a threat. I bought this game because I love my children, if you love your you should buy it for them as well.
This game is very fun, but it is scary. There are many situations where you have to decide between your life or someone else's. There are terrorists killing civilians, and suicide bombings. Overall, its fine for anyone who can take it.
I do think this game has role models, Farah Karim is a strong female protagonist. Playing at the age of 22 I found her storyline shocking and a bit disturbing, but I can appreciate the reality of situations like hers. The entire campaign storyline was extremely violent and graphic, not something I'd want my kids to play until at least age 16.
It’s a fun a really fun game and I think if you’re child is asking for a game from the call of duty franchise this is a good game to start with
I used to be big into shooters when I was younger. The call of duty franchise was always one I enjoyed, and one that I believe mature teens or possibly younger should be able to enjoy. I've seen several parents talk about the graphic nature of the campaign/story mode saying it's over the top and extreme, which I disagree with. The campaign portrays the British and American and some Middle Eastern forces fighting against terrorist group Al-Qatala. It can be graphic at times, such as showing a terrorist attack in London. Though it may sound bad, a young person should be able to deal with this and understand the situation. It does in no way glorify war and conflict. There are several Male and Female role models in the story who play big parts in the game. The multiplayer is a classic fps, with little amounts of blood simple, though challenging combat. It is a very enjoyable game, and one you should give a chance, as the media can sometimes over-exaggerate on these titles.
I bought this game for my 13 year old thinking its going to be a bad choice but i was looking at the settings and you can turn off blood and gore and its just a shooter like uncharted and its a great to socialize because theres teamwork involved and its great for the situation we are in right now.
its graphics are amazing and its pretty realistic
Consists of some possibly disturbing scenes, but nothing my kids have not heard of seen before
Hello Parents. You have probably come to this website because your youth will not stop bugging to let them play this game. Whether it be that all their classmates have it or not, I would like to shed a little light on this game. It's obvious that Call of Duty games might be a little more on the violent side, but as a fellow parent, I can assure you that it's nothing too bad. Yes, there is blood. Yes, there is gore. But one day your kid is going to witness it all in the world wide civil war. Trust me. It will happen. All jokes aside, people often tend to pull Call of Duty in the category of games such as GTA or some other game. There is no need for this over exaggeration. Surely you don't want a kid that passes at the sight of blood. This will tough em up. :) La'Quchiaua Loves You! &lt;3
This is a good game for anyone above the age of9 with the content filters on. These content filters get rid of all bad language and gore bar the cut scenes that you should tell your child to skip. LOTS OF LOVE KAREN SMITH. The media is wrong about this game and I trusted them. In short do not trust the media about any video games. Or video game consoles. Video games enrich your child's life experience especially this one. KAREN SMITH APPROVES
The next Call of Duty Game
Violent
Finally a CoD game worth buying
Should be rated based on maturity
Should be fine for most 14 year olds and even some mature 13 year olds.
Too Graphic.
Great for kids
TURN OFF BLOOD AND GORE AND EVERYTHING IS OK
Geez csm, back at it again with overating good games.... ( I mean age rating)
Great game for young teens! Awesome storyline!
Fun game as a parent I love to see my son having phone with this.
Fine for kids 12 and up
10+
Its not that bad
COD MW
multiplayer 12+ campaign 15+
Rated 15+ for strong bloody violence and language.
My child is 13 and for her birthday only wished for this game. Having heard of how bad call of duty can be I was very hesitant but I looked at the gameplay online and did a bit of research. The story mode can be a bit scary but in the settings, you can turn off blood and gore as well as profanity. the multiplayer had no disturbing scenes and was definitely not too much for 13 year olds. Overall the media has portrayed modern warfare as a gross scary game when really it just takes a bit of maturity and some changes in the settings to make it appropriate for all teens.
The game is essentially divided into a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign takes you through the story of anti-terrorists. The campaign alone should be 14+ due to some brutal scenes but with the gore and blood filter it becomes 13+ as it is mature for most kids. The reason the campaign isn't worse is because it makes you realise what's going on isn't good and that violence shouldn't be glorified. It is essentially like a 15 rated war film that is a lot less bloody if you want it to be as it portrays war as something brutal that shouldn't be enjoyed. tHe multiplayer is a 11+ as there is little blood to no blood and noinappropriate scenes. As opposed to many stereotypes of Call of Duty it isn't as bad as media portrays it.
This game has Blood, Decapitation, Main Purpose is killing people, You do interrogate people, lots of swearing, Cut scenes have some intense potentially scary violent acts. One of the badges you can get shows a person smoking weed. This game is a pretty fun game but kids shouldn't play it until they're 18.
Great graphics but very violent - I would truly rather my kids watched united than this, and that is saying something!
Multiplayer fine for ages 11+ but I’d wait until your kid is 13-14 to play campaign (Pretty gruesome and dark). This game is awesome the sound affects and detail are next to none. And it looks great on Xbox. Multiplayer is just fine for younger kids when you shot an enemy there is a little puff of blood but nothing crazy. Campaign can be dark at time and disturbing, but I think it was 100% worth it to include that content. The game has a more realistic feel.
This game is pretty violent, and inappropriate all around. I would defenitly not let anyone under 13 play this game, but it might be ok to let a 13 year old play it. It really depends on their maturity. If you have a teen that cusses without you allowing them to, is really obsessed with guns (if they talk about murder or guns too much), or if they take drugs or do anything illegal don’t let them play. If they do none of these things, it’s completely fine to let a teen play. There are positive role models (not a lot) and lessons despite the very dark topic, and it’s better to learn about the real hard things as a kid than an adult. Do monitor your kids behavior just in case, but don’t take it away if they do one wrong thing. I’d personally say almost any kid should be able to play this, and parents need to really think hard about their kids maturity. But all in all, there’s tobacco/alcohol use, positive role models/lessons, some pretty heavy gore and cussing, but can really be a good game that deserves a different ESRB rating.
The violence isn't that gory, just very brutal.
Its way too graphic. For example: If you shoot someone the bullet hole stays there. And they bleed. Shooting unarmed women. Way too scary and graphic. Most certainly returning this back to game stop.
Any kid can play this. The violence has been exaggerated by media and your kid should play it.
Once you turn off blood and gore there are no limbs and legs flying off people. The only bad things is torture and that is very mild when you turn this setting on. The language is no worse than your child has heard in a movie or even at school. Before I bought this for my son I played it myself and agreed he could play it if he said he would never do drugs or any of that stuff. I say this as one parent to another turn off blood and gore and it is not that bad.
This game is amazing, the only issue might be the violence yet luckily there is a gore and profanity filter just in case if bloody visuals are too much, and to add on to that, this is an amazing game for people who have not tried the O.G Modern Warefare because this is the same game but with inhansed graphics and a gore filter.... Your 12 years old will love it!
Here’s what I think about COD modern warfare. To gamers, I enjoyed the storyline thoroughly. Aside from WW2, I’d say it had the best storyline yet. Sadly it didn’t include zombies, which isn’t a surprise, after all I hope we all agree that COD BO4 zombies was terrible. The multiplayer wasn’t as good as BO1 or BO2, but it was much better than the last few multiplayer COD’s For the parents, The game is extremely violent, but I wouldn’t be terribly worried about it. Because if this is the first COD they ever had played, than I wouldn’t let them play it, I would make them play some of the older COD’s (for bloody graphics) . Aside from that, the storyline is dark. So for a child’s mind it might be a little much, but for a teen, it’s not bad. Overall, great game for YOUNGER TEENS.
As long as you stay away from the campaign which is a story where you go through missions your fine. The blood in the game is barely visible and you don't see it.
This game is fine for kids 12 and up, as there is a blood and profanity/swearing option. The multiplayer is great,it opens up a whole new world in the modern warfare series. It’s fine even though it’s rated 18+ it shouldn’t be. I let my kids play this as I have spent quite a few hours myself playing the campaign. It’s fine!!
this game is not violent enough to be 18+ there is options for blood and profanity to be turned off and should be fine for a 10 year old however, my recommendation would be for 13+ because at this age children should be more than mature enough to play games such as COD Battlefield ect.
Ive seen my 10 year old kid play it and its generally not that bad, theres some blood here and there and some dismemberment with some of the 50 cal weapons but its just another shooter game its not bad at all, although there is a bit much swearing in the campaign but its nothing a 10 year old cant handle.
GOOD GAME HARD TO PLAY UNTIL USED TO GAME THE OLY BAD POINT IS THAT ONLINE PLAYERS DO GET ANNOYING ON THE MIC. ALSO THERE IS TOO MUCH VIOLANCE FOR MY SON WHO IS 14 TO PLAY THIS. AGES 16+
the multiplayer can be disturbing for kids under 15 but i have watched my son play modern warfare and the game has a feature where you can turn off blood and swearing. To be honest the swearing is not as bad as some of the things they would be hearing in school anyway. The 18 plus tag is simply a guideline for the campaign and doesn't really reflect the true nature of the game. I have been buying my son the annual call of duty for 2 years now and he is a good lad and loves playing with his friends. I used to think this game was as bad as the ones i used to play (black ops 1, world at war) so i wouldn't usually let him play but as I saw some of the gameplay I realized it wasn't really that bad If your child has the maturity to tell the difference between a game and real life i think that he/she would enjoy playing this game
