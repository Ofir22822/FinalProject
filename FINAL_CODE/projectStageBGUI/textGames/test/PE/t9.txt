Turn off the kill cam
Brilliant chaotic fun
You can kill Hitler!
There is an option to turn off kill am in single player
I love this series.
This game is great. It is for kids when they turn off the killcam. The killcam is the only thing that makes this game inappropriate. Other than that it is for children 8 and up.
I love the sniper elite series-and so do my kids. At first, I was a bit sceptical introducing them to this controversial series and I understand the concerns of fellow parents. However, the only prominent issue in this game is the x ray kill cam. While pretty bloody, gore isn't actually present. No limbs go flying, only shards of bone and-what honestly looks like- the deflation of vital organs. If these are a major concern or do still seem worrying, they can be disabled meaning the game has next to no really violent features. Unlike most in this genre, it has a T rating as while there is violence, it's minimal and quite infrequent. Dark themes, swearing, etc aren't really present at all here so no worries for fear factor. It's a stealth game and just like most in the stealth genre, violence isn't nearly as frequent as say, COD or Battlefield. I'd say a relatively mature 13 yr old, or a VERY mature 12 yr old could play this. It's teen, make your choice parents...
Hi Im Adam. My son wanted this game for Christmas, however I said no. The following day I let him watch Saving Private Ryan. After seeing the cool sniper in that movie this game came back up as a huge topic. Finally, I said yes. This is why. Let me just say this, all parents who doesn't let your kid play sniper elite because of the kill cam is ok in thinking that, however this kill cam can be turned off. The kill cam is a camera that follows your bullets as they hit your opponent. I've played the game campaign and never heard swearing. Is blood a problem? The kill cam option makes it hard to see blood because of the distance you are from your enemies. Finally lets talk about the story. As you can guess you take the role of a sniper in Africa. This man had one task, to stop the Nazis! Taking out German generals is incredible satisfying. One last thing, lets talk about Hitler. The most evil man in the world is in this game and you get to kill him! In conclusion, this game is 100% historically accurate and teaches you a lot about world war 2 (the only false thing is killing hitler) so any teen/kid or adult who has seen Saving Private Ryan should play! I give this game 5 stars and a age 12 and up rating! I hope this helped you, bye!
Ok for every parent who doesn't let your 12 year old play sniper elite because of the kill cam that is just stupid and they don't ever swear I've played the game campaign like 36 times and never heard swearing and there is a option called off blood and turn the chance of the kill am happening by turning it all the way down
I turn off kill cam as it slows down gameplay in my opinion and dont want my kids to accidentally see. There is still a bullet cam which slow motions the bullet hitting the target, with some blood but it's more cartoony than realistic there. You can press any button for it to cancel either however and it wont show the victims getting hit. Blood stays on walls or on the ground and bodies stay intact but spotted with blood after explosions. The series employs rag doll deaths. You'll need to angle the camera up to avoid looking at the corpses around kids as this is a game series that will give little kids &lt;6 a nightmare depending on the sensitivity and understanding of the child. But then a police show on youtube kids gave my 4year old girl a nightmare too. In the downloadable extra missions there are obvious torture rooms but again things hit different kids differently, that part got to me and im in my early 30s. Karl's friend bower is killed by a tank but this is implied not shown. The end video is non skippable as in v2, and he shoots the top nazi in the head while pinned under debris. My kids 4&amp;5 call them bad people and it just takes some pre-practice to know how to "edit" the visual so they dont see what would be too much. I play with morning coffee before kids wake up but my oldest does like to watch sometimes if she gets up earlier. Karl is war hardened but a good guy character according to the game story, he is concerned with events and can come up with things like "those weapons must not be allowed to leave here".
Fun game
It's fun, but has it's downsides as well. Like The Ruined City which is too much like Dark Souls anor londo. Easy to get lost in.
Fifa is Football
Idiot of a Son (17) has MAJOR anger issues with this game!
Really recommend for soccer fans!
Angry and Frustrated son
How could you not let someone play football? Fifa is a great game, every year EA do a great job. I know, yes, it costs a fair amount of money, but i feel the game is enjoyable, i play against my son on the PS4 and i ensure we have a good time while regulating play. When he gets good grades i occasionally get him a bit of FIFA points as well. There is NO bad language, with no chat function, and in no way violent, sexual, or related to drugs and alcohol. It's easy to play and quite fun, even if you're an adult!
Imagine a quiet Sunday afternoon or a week day morning - all in the house is quiet - when all of a sudden an almighty deep scream is heard throughout the house, the air literally turns thick with bad language and screams of, only what I can describe, anguish, pain and frustration!!! I jump out of my skin - he does not listen to us and it turns my stomach! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! We have literally just had to split my 2 eldest sons (Idiot (17) and Idiot (19)) because Idiot 17 is blaming Idiot 19 for using up the WiFi! If it was a disc I would have smashed it up by now - but he has downloaded it. The stress levels in this house (especially in lockdown) are through the roof as it is.
This game is very good for me. First time I ever played FIFA was the 2008 game which came out in 2007. At first the controls are kinda complicated, but you will get used to it! You can also change the controls settings which is very helpful. Career mode is really cool you get to create your own player or choose a real one. It gives the perspective of a soccer player career. There are several modes that are also as fun to play! This game deserves its five stars!
It's ok for 8 and up I don't see anything bad about fifa it's fun
I bought FIFA 20 as the previous versions of the game have been great, career mode is good for kids to play football and learn about the game and understand different strategies. This verion comes with the FUT champs game, which i understand was in other versions but my son never played. He has been playing FUT champs in the last few months and the only way to progress and compete appears to be via paying a lot of $$$ to get good cards/players. He also gets angry and frustrated when playing, you can be ahead for 90% of the game and suddenly lose in the last few minutes. Having read forums this appears to be a common problem with the game.
Konami ruins another classic series. Not for fans at all. Play the phenomenal Blazing Chrome instead!
Has none of the tight platforming and brisk run and gun action of the classics. Not even any memorable music. Instead we get tacked on RPG elements (a new trend in bad games) that only serve to create bullet sponge enemies that make the gun overheat mechanic even more frustrating and to encourage grinding through bland level design that has the nerve to repeat itself early on in a campaign that is way longer than it should be (Contras are usually 2 hours long [assuming you never game over]; this is almost 15 hours!). Sluggish movement and aiming that does not fit the pace of the game at all . Top it off with an UGLY art style with graphics straight outta 2003. Shameful. They should've just let WayForward make Contra 5. Theres alot of gore but its all pink for some reason with no option for red blood. Frequent F words.
Fantastic game, that's a little more accessible than other Zelda games
Great for Team Play
Great game, and highly recommend it. In terms of content and age appropriateness, all Zelda's have a darker 'big bad' behind them, than say the Mario games. So there's a little bit to consider there. Also the game ultimately involves slashing a lot of things with a sword, although no gore. Zelda also involves often loosely guided puzzle solving, that is more complicated than a Mario game. So for children who do not deal well with getting stuck for either a) boredom or b) frustration induced tantrums, I'd maybe leave it until they're older, and more able to figure out the puzzles (and therefore enjoy it more). Overall, this is the most accessible Zelda game though. - It's less dark - the bad guy is a bad spirit inside an egg. The menace is very minimal. I can't see this scaring the majority of children, whatever age. - It's less violent - with more cartoony battles than normal. But I think it would inspire role-playing with pretend swords etc. - It's easy to play - effectively 2D making control simpler to master, and the world is relatively small and self-contained. The puzzles are a similar standard to others though. Personally, even with a budding gamer girl (age 6) I don't think I'll be reaching for Zelda until she's at least 7, probably 8. Mainly because I think she'd just find it too frustrating. It requires patience and persistence to enjoy. The violence/darkness is less of an issue with this one. The plot/setting is a bit cryptic as well, and I'm not sure she'd get it yet.
My son (5 1/2) recurved this game for Christmas. He had been playing Luigi Mansion 3 and loved it. So we thought he enjoy this too. Since he doesn’t read my husband and I knew we were going to need to help him. We helped him and he took off with it. He could do a majority of the game by himself. And when he got stuck we’d look up how to fix it or what he missed. There’s very little violence. No blood or gore. It was very fun for my son to play and replay!
Completely unobjectionable
Excellent
Instant hit
Good fun
The only reason I put 5+ is because I'm not sure if anyone younger could get down the controls (or if I'd let them handle my Switch).
Really well done.
My 6 year old son who has a mischievous streak was able to live out his greatest fantasy of playing pranks on people albeit as a goose. He laughed so hard and got really involved trying to sneak things past the groundskeeper. Though the puzzles were a little bit beyond him and he did get a little frustrated with the controls. At one stage he felt sorry for the groundskeeper so be of mind the goose is an absolute pest to people so theres no positive messages here. But for pure unadulterated fun and mischief this game is spectacular in its delivery.
Really clever puzzles that work well for all ages. Kids love being sneaky goose. The goose behavior is certainly "bad" but in a very playful pretend way. A huge hit in our home
Nothing they have not seen
This game is a masterpiece, a mix of horror and battle royale. It really challenges you because if you die you don't just lose some stats you lose that kit and hunter. This keeps the game interesting as you always have to be on high alert. This games only factor is violence/horror. In this game there is blood but no gore. All the things in this game you will see in most 12 rated films these days. Overall I highly recommend this to any young FPS player.
Simple Yet Fun Twist on Childhood Game
I don’t know if you other parents played Floor is Lava as kids, but I sure know I did. With a new generation of kids, I think turning the game into a video game will make for hours of fun
NHL 20 review
Don't bother giving EA another 85$for a roster update,they can't even get that right. The game is full of old bugs and glitches, an being the same game for the whole PS4 generation it's downright embarrassing.
Deplorable and perverted language mire an otherwise good game.
Phenomenal game, extremely enjoyable
Great Game
Borderlands 3
AWESOME
This is perfectly fine why is it rated m
Amazing game great expierence
Amazing game
Borderlands 3 good for kids?
This game is fantastic, and common sense media is completley wrong!
It is completely fine
Not for kids! But not 18+!
The Best.
an explosively great time!

The Common sense reviewer admits to the games extremely overt sexual banter, but then applauds it for not discriminating against it? That's like saying "Sure, he had his pants around his ankles, but he gave a friendly hello as we walked by." There is literally a murdering contest in the game to see who gets to 'sleep with' someone with countless descriptive sexual references that are shameless and unapologetic, and this goes on throughout an entire mission. Kids have NO business playing this game and there is no option to turn it off. Nuff said. Aside from that, the majority of the time the game just desperately gets you to like it with nonstop jokes, some are funny and many of them get tired as it is a shallow, nonstop parade of pop references and bits that actually become tiresome at times. You feel some "guilt by association" along the way as you play the game and enjoy the gunfights but have to listen to the white noise of frequent juvenile nonsense. It's too bad you can't opt out of the dialogue, but there are so many cameos and celebrity voices in here that they are going to make you hear it. Like it or NO. The GOOD though. Never has there been a 'looter shooter' with so many weapons, so much of which feel very exotic, most of which you obtain through playing the main game and campaign. There is ALOT of gore, but you can turn it off and it is NOT just bugs and aliens as another reviewer said, it IS mostly humans actually. The enemy types aren't endless, but there is adequate variety and some interesting boss fights, some of which are more powerful and others more minor and simplistic, but boss enemies are a big part of the experience. The movement is fluid, traversing feels intuitive, you can pull yourself up from a half landed jump, shoot while sliding across the ground and drive several types of vehicles. so mobility is better than ever and the guns have weight and good sound to each one with alot of variety. the only downside to the gun collecting was that they are NOT upgradable and become obsolete as you level up, so you never stick to one loadout for long. So with 3 skill trees for each of the 4 characters, trinkets, and weapons perks, you will grind with meaning and noticable improvement making this one of those games you can get lost in for what you think is a few hours, then you realize you spent your day somehow. It's a genuinely fun game and I never really liked Borderlands before. It's too bad I can't wholeheartedly encourage the game with the "in your face" language and highly inappropriate, gross sex talk. As a side note, multiplayer is hard to pull off as players on different levels are rubber banded to meet in the middle for difficulty, meaning if you are the lower level player, you're going to feel pretty spongey and weak trying to keep up. Also, this game DOES have split screen 2 player, but it doesn't run as well and can be a bit laggie.
Let me first say that this website is a joke. The reviews made by common sense provide no help whatsoever, as no context is provided with any of their descriptions, which can make a lot of content seem much worse than it is. ------------------ Borderlands 3 is an amazing game with extremely large replayabilty. I have sunk many hours into this game, as its impressive graphics and fun and goofy story line make for an enjoyable experience. The violence is quite comical and OTT(over the top), but by turning it off in the settings it becomes equivalent to the violence in about that of a 12-15 rated movie. And has the game is obviously animated, it does not look as real as real life(duh). And due to the fast paced nature of the game, the violence is pretty easily overlooked by the player, who would be more focused on the gameplay elements. The innuendo is reasonably funny for the most part, and to be honest, there was more suggestive and inappropriate innuendos in Shrek than this game. And once again, it is very easy for the player to overlook this innuendos as they are too focused on playing the game. This game also has a very modern outlook on relationships and equality. None of the themes are demeaning to women, and their are LGBT characters in this game, making it a lot more progressive than some of the others in the looter shooter genre. There are bars located in the game, but that's about it. And references to drunkenness are hardly that serious. And you could probably find more alcohol and cigarettes in Tom and Jerry. In terms of language, its quite full of it, but as someone who has been to school before, I guarantee your child will have heard worse. And i'll mention this once again, the language is easy to overlook once immersed in the gameplay. Ethically, this game is pretty sound. I get that some parents may have issues where their child shoots other people, but in this game the majority is aliens and robots, and the people you do shoot are all post apocalyptic psychos. In terms of ethics, you could say something like Overwatch possess more questionable themes, as half the characters you shoot in that are sane good guys, but oh well. Also pretty much all the guys you shoot have masks on aswell. As someone who has being a fan of the borderlands franchise for many years, i can say with confidence that your child will love this game. I let my 15 year old daughter start playing this game a week ago, and can tell she loves it as much as i do. And because of the games multiplayer elements, we are able to play together, and always have heaps of fun. She also enjoys playing the game with her friends, and like all co-op games, it can help with building teamwork skills. As long as you feel your child is mature, you should absolutely let your child play this game. Also the game is on discount right now on the epic games store for about £23 pounds, which is a large drop from £50. ------------------------- Finally, I would like to say that i see parents who look at games, see the red 18 and IMMEDIATELY veto it. That's hardly fair. We are brought up not to judge a book by its cover, or people by their appearance, so why do the same to games.
I have a son who just got this game and he is 12 years old. I have watched him play and it seems fine to me. I would recommend to kids in middle school and older. There is not that much sex even though it says it was high.
This game is very fun and should not be an eighteen got it for my twelve yr old and he loved it.
Borderlands 3 is really good. The violence in it that it’s so fast paced you don’t even care about the explosion of the enemy you just killed because you’re on to the next on. The swearing has only 2 f bombs. There is no nudity or sex, however there is a mission all about winning this man’s affection and he says “My Positive into your Negative” which is a nod to sex but that is the worst thing it also it’s optional.
This game has a button to turn off the blood no way is this m rated also. What do you mean sexual content and language? First of all, for sexual content, the only thing I'm seeing is the character wearing underwear which is actually really funny but for the language, the only thing I'm hearing is $h*t and a$$*ole sometimes characters will say ahh great you f--ked up but the thing is it's actually censors it and for the first time have is seen a game that censors its own content. My 10-year-old son plays and he is totally fine he doesn't like it when he sees blood but unlike doom, there is a censored mode and very little blood.
This is a game I played with my son. It was a great bonding expeirence for the both of us, I think this game has amazing messages and its too hard to learn.
I have an 10 year old and a 13 year old, that both adore this game. It may seem bad but its nothing worse than anything your kids have seen in movies. I recommend this game for at least 10+.
Yes borderlands 3 is fine for 11+ you may think “oh this game a Has too much swearing or blood and gore” the thing is that if you don’t have subtitles on and don’t have noise there’s no swearing and blood and gore you can turn off in the settings menu. If you think what about the sexual themes we’ll boys take off there shirts or stuff like that but nothing bad.Plus some characters are good role models because they stand up for themselves and show that it’s ok to be different or to make your own path. This game is like a pg-13 movie
this game has the same amount of violence in a pg 13 movie there is no sex but boys take of there shirts off. I bought it for my 12 and my 10 year old and they loved it
You can compare the violence to Team Fortress 2. Language isn't too bad, but your kids hear way worse everyday at school. A few sex jokes, but nothing that couldn't be in a PG-13 movie. Honestly, the "expert review" is wrong and kids 12-13 and up could easily play this. (It's much better than getting them games like Grand Theft Auto or Call Of Duty)!
I have 3 kids and sometimes play myself and from my review it has no bad sides, the violence is Cartoony and fun and I watch my kids play and its fine. I would highly recommend this for kids ages 12 plus as it is pretty much perfect in every way
In my opinion, common sense has no common sense. To parents, I wouldn’t say it’s for kids, I would say it’s in the 15-17 age range. Body chunks are left behind and characters are killed gruesomely. There are several sexual references. And parents, this is gonna sound very crazy, but if your kid is highly mature and will get these funny references, it will actually make the game more friendly. Several F-bombs are dropped, but that’s really nothing to worry about. If your child is looking for a good game, this shouldn’t be there number 1 option. Thank you, again.
On the outside, it looks super gritty with a tone inappropriate for kids, but if you think your teenager is mature and will be responsible, you are fine. It’s fun no matter how old you are, and after playing through twice, it would be fine for anyone 13 and up.
Borderlands is an FPS RPG where its all about the loot. You get that loot by killing enemies and bosses with some pretty imaginative weapons. Enemies will lose limbs, get their head shot off, get electrocuted, get corroded, etc. With that being said, the game is done in an art style called cell shading. This means that it looks similar to how a comic book would. Enemies explode into clouds of blood and gore. Language isn't horrible. Nothing explicit is said that wouldn't be allowed in a T rated game aside from the innuendos. Sex jokes are common but will more than likely go over a kids head. Overall, it is a super fun experience that is even better with friends to enjoy over and over again. I know that when I have kids that I will be having them play this series. Its one of my favorites.
Borderlands 3 is a great game. It is extremely fun with a memorable art style... but there is violence... in the game you shoot many enemies but most of them are creatures like demogorgan dogs and giant insects shooting them with funny weapons such as guns that shoot burgers, the true problem for the game is the games rating.
