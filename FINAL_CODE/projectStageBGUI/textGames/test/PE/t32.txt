Star wars jedi fallen order
Realistic, but not that violent
I think it’s a great game it’s the first game that EA isn’t trying to take your money and follows the Star Wars plot perfectly 100% worth it
Ok pegi is wrong. This game is fine for 11 and up. There is no blood or gore. But it is quite difficult.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single player action adventure game developed by Respawn Entertainment, the developers of Apex Legends. In Fallen Order, players play as Cal Kestis, the survivor of the Jedi Purge. Untrusting and frightened, Cal needs to relearn the ways of the Force to find a list of Force-Sensitive children. Accompanying him are Cere Junda, a Former Jedi, Greez Dritus, a stubborn pilot, and the adorable BD-1. However, he is being hunted by the evil Imperial Inquisitor, the Second Sister and her platoons of Stormtroopers and Purgetroopers. The game has excellent mechanics, from the sword fighting gameplay inspired by Breath of the Wild, Sekiro, and Dark Souls, to the puzzle solving aspect similar to Portal, as well as a 62+-0ridiculous poncho customizer. The game features a natural progression system, with a skill tree. The game is currently harboring a good 79% on Metacritic. Some things I really think help the game are the customization, the satisfaction of wal running, and the interesting story. One drawback is the story feels a little short. I would give JFO a 4.7/5. Some of the encounters with bad guys can be a little violent, but you can only dismember non humans. It might be a little scary sometimes, though.
star wars the jedi fallen order is a fun game to play and its story mode is really nice but a kid of 8 can play it and not under 8 kids can not play it
Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is honestly one of my favorite video-games of all time. I thought it would be another Star Wars video-game failure (no offense) just like Star Wars Battlefront II. Cause that game wasn’t all that great. However, the graphics are really great, the plot / story is very engaging and brilliant, and about halfway through the game I felt empathy for all these characters. This game FELT like it had the potential to be an amazing spin-off Movie, just like Solo and Rogue One. Also, the controls are astonishing. It is very easy to maneuver and it is satisfying to take control of a Jedi. As Cal Kestis, you can use Force Push, Force Freeze, Force Pull, Pull out double bladed lightsaber, Lightsaber Throw and much more that will keep you engaged. Also, I think that BD-1 is my favorite Star Wars droid in the entire franchise. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is definitely worth buying, if you want to have a satisfying and engaging gameplay of a day in the life of a Jedi.
A little Violent though
I think that this game is great for pre-teens who are starting to be allowed to play some M (I'm Austrailian) games. Note I have not finished the game, so I may not know some details, but I doubt there will be much worse than what I have already seen. It is a great game that I enjoy playing. The violence in the game is more limited than this website, and most national ratings suggest, as, whilst you wield a lightsaber in the game, there is no blood. Alien and stormtrooper corpes do lie on the ground and not despawn until your next save, however they are not gross in the silightest, and should be fine for any child above 10. There is no sex, or drugs/alcohol in the game, and the only language is the word bastard, which I have only heard once, and doubt it will be used again in the remaining section of the game. The game is not addictive, and can actually get tedious after long amounts of play, preventing kids from grinding to upgrade - the format also prevents this, as it is a full campaign game, with most of the upgrades being progressive. The main character is a great role mode as he stands up for what he thinks is right with the rebels, and displays the positive messages of not giving up, and freedom of voice. Whilst it is a single-player only game, it is good to have some of these for if your friends can't play with you, or you don't have wifi. This game is extremely fun, and I would reccomend it to any responsible kid above the age of 10, especially as a smooth transition to late PG to early M games (Once again, I'm Australian, so the ratings might be different for you). Although it is reasonably expensive, you can get it a lot cheaper second hand, or from some discount stores. Overall, great game, get it now.
This game is GREAT!!! I love how there is combat but also fun and challenging puzzles. Cal and BD-1 are a great team, and Cal only kills things that attack him first. There are a few dark spots, but never any blood.
I think this is an amazing game. It is a bit violent but if you are a star wars fan than you know that violent is not exactly the same as other games. Didn't catch any blood. It is a very complex game to learn though and if you don't play for a while than you WILL forget the controls but over all it is a great game. Big Star Wars fan
The game has very few flaws, mainly with its physics engine, and a few textures look incredibly bad (at least on ps4, I’ve not played on Xbox). Aside from those couple of issues, the game is great! I’m a fan of 3D platform and action games, and it definitely satisfies those areas. The games combat system is similar to Dark Souls, as it requires the player to have fast reactions and know the controls well. The challenge comes when your surrounded by a large group of enemies, as your health is relatively low, and you take a large amount of damage from attacks. The game isn’t nearly as hard as Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro, but it does provide a challenge, yet still being accessible for players new to the genre. The game also shines in its exploration. It provides incentive to look around every turn and corner, and feels somewhat like a metroidvania game, requiring certain abilities to access certain areas of the map, as well as skills in the platforming department. In short, the game has some minor flaws in the graphics department, but it really excels in its gameplay , with its fast paced combat, and the joy of exploring the many worlds the game offers.
This game is a must play for anyone who loves Star Wars, or action games in general. The combat itself is fantastic, and very skill based. The story puts an interesting spin on the post order 66 story. When the game was announced, I was worried the story would be another generic Jedi in hiding story, but the game’s story is great and original. As for violence, it’s mostly standard Star Wars, but there are a few scary elements. There are undead creatures that will likely frighten younger players, and a giant spider creature that could scare people with arachnophobia (like myself), and the battles can be intense. Overall, great game.
it had an awesome story line but it has the worst physics i have ever played out of any game
it is a good game.
This game is incredibly detailed and has a compelling storyline and characters. This game has some violence simpler to the violence in the Star Wars movies. Their is only a very few instances where the word “bastard” is used.
This game is amazing, from the story to the graphics, Respawn and EA did well. Creatures can be cut in half, but no human characters are dismembered. There is no blood or gore, so violence is at a minimum. Minimal language with a couple uses of hell and one use of bastard. The only disturbing piece is that on one certain planet there are undead creatures that can be resurrected through a chant. This game dives heavily into the spiritual beliefs in the Star Wars universe, but is overall a masterpiece of a game.
Caves and dark spotss freak me out. Theese rat things comeout of the ground and attack u. I turn my brightness up to max and it looks trash bot i dont get freaked out. NOW VILOENCE IS DIFFRENT u slice a set place of a animal. stormtroopers just die.
This is a ridiculously well-made game with amazing, realistic graphics. There is no inappropriate content whatsoever, and the Jedi (and republic) characters are strong and care for each other. Once you reach this island when you are trying to get to a Jedi temple, there are some monsters that I think anyone 10 or under will NOT like. They have three bright orange eyes, move in a weird curling way and have teeth and fangs on their tongues. The violence is fine, there isn’t any blood, but there are constant enemies you will have to kill. This is an action packed, beautifully made (it is totally worth the price) game that I would recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or not. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t seen any of the Star Wars movies to play this. Thanks for reading!
I thank it was a good game. Because this game was great they don't have any bad thing on there. just a little. that was fine.
This game is about as violent as a Star Wars movie is. It has its battle moments, whether it be stormtroopers or battling other people with lightsabers. There is no dismemberment while fighting, and fighting scenes don't even last that long. Overall, great puzzles, awesome story, and amazing gameplay. I would put it at 10 and up for kids that can handle mild realistic violence. But definitely nothing over the top.
Uncharted for Children
It sometimes chops out alien/robot body parts so it changed my rating from E to 8. It does not have nothing inappropriate whatsoever. This game unlike other Star Wars Games has parkour with an Uncharted style into it, I would say it is an Uncharted for children. Really good game.
Rated 15 (strong language, threat, violence).
basically just cutscenes and walking around
NO WAY. THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE 13-DEATH WE PART
Incredibly Dissapointing
Really good action game mixes great role models and messages with suspense and stealth.
SEX/NUDITY - Some mild verbal sexual references, and moments of natural nudity (mainly buttocks). VIOLENCE/GORE - Moments of moderate violence occur throughout, where the main character must knock out enemies to progress, or where enemies attack the main character, although violence is not the primary focus of the game. There are also scenes of fantasy violence where fantastical creatures attack humans by dragging them under a tar-like liquid or consuming them (these scenes are more scary/intense than violent). PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck") and other milder terms used throughout the game, though not excessively. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Occasional drug references, where the main character is asked to deliver packages which contain "drugs". Although the "drugs" aren't exactly specified for what their uses are, there is brief mention that they make people "happy". There are also occassional scenes of alcohol consumption. THREAT/HORROR - Sequences of strong sustained threat and moderate horror throughout. These involve intense and suspenseful moments where characters are menaced by almost-invisible supernatural beings. There are other moments while traversing through the environment where the main character will encounter strange and disturbing creatures resembling humans emerging from pools of a black tar-like liquid, and they try to drag you down below the surface. These enemies are a primary focus of the game's narrative, and cannot be avoided. 15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.
dont bother getting this game just a lot of cutscenes and walking around lots of swearing too total waste of 60 bucks
DEATH STRANDING IS A GAME FOR TEENS. I KNOW THAT OLDER TEENS WILL ENJOY IT MORE, BUT IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANYTHING THAT YOUR TEEN HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED TO.
So the game's main premise is walking, walking walking walking. There are parts where the game is incredibly tedious and can bore the player. The game's visuals and the story is incredible. The visuals make you feel isolated on monster-infested Earth. The story also carries out these amazing visuals with the cutscenes being incredibly intriguing and fun to watch. Overall the game is incredibly boring but the story sometimes makes up for it. I still give it a 2 star because the gameplay makes the game not so great. It would be a little bit better if there were more frequent attacks from the enemies, but even when they do attack the controls feel extremely clunky and janky (same goes with the vehicles).
I personally really like this game. It's about reconnecting people together in a broken country by walking across the terrain, making deliveries to people whilst expanding a network that connects everyone together, called the "chiral network." Let's start off with the fact that the map is huge. Over 10 miles of land you can traverse through, and most of it is either flat terrain or rocky mountains. The game also features snowy mountains. The player, or Sam Porter Bridges (who you play as), also has a BB unit (Bridge Baby), which has a connection to the "other side", so it can spot invisible entities/enemies called BTs (short for Beached Things), enemies that you cannot see but they're still frightening. The game also features other enemies, such as MULEs, other humans that have an obsession with cargo (unfortunate for Sam; that's what he's carrying). These enemies have guns and rifles, however they are often non-lethal and electric. Some missions features sneaking into MULE camps and retrieving cargo from their postboxes. The game features partial nudity, which includes male buttocks. It also contains some gory cutscenes, including characters committing suicide and other gruesome acts. The story is pretty difficult to follow, and is told mostly via cutscenes. The intro to the story might feel very long, since it's just cutscenes and shorter deliveries. There is also the swearing: multiple f-bombs, s-words and other curse words are dropped. However, the role models and messages are great and shows friendship, connection, and if people are playing online, their structures or their avatar might even get likes from other players. In my personal opinion, this game is one of the best ever, and I highly recommend it to anyone 15+.
