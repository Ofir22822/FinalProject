I LOVE THIS GAME, AND IT'S REALLY FUN!!!
Campaign is 16+, Multiplayer is Probably 13+
Take it from the people who play it. Not the "expert reviews".
This game is very disapointing

Really good game but a bit much for some kids
Commonsensemedia doesn’t have any common sense

A Real Thought Provoker
Good game but has problems

Wow
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) follows; Commander Shepard, Kyle Garrick, Alex, and Farah Karim as they fight a terrorist group in the fictional country of Urzikstan. The game seems to push the idea of ends justify the means, and that whatever soldiers have to do is permissible, all the while saying it is up to the player to make their own moral decisions. The campaign features torture, and constant violence, and language. The multiplayer is a completely different story, if you don't mind a little blood it should be fine, but the campaign is absolutely 16+
Yeah its violent but you can go into settings and turn that and the profanity off. These people are ignorant about everything and don't let your kids play games based off what they say. Just be careful about online players. And there is a lot of DLC's so make sure they by stuff with permission. Its a great game with great role models doing the right thing. Trust me I am a call of duty OG.
The game is fun but the problem with it is that the frames drop when playing. I would recommend this game 13+. The reason for this is because of the violence, swearing,Drugs/Drinking, and too much consumerism.
I love this game. The campaign and even multiplayer has quite a few F-bombs, but not an insane amount though. The blood isn’t really too bad, either, but the violence can be brutal at times none the less. I think it’s suitable for ages 14+
Ok it’s call of duty is a great game but may be to much for kids there is gore and swearing but like the other modern warfares it’s based on what happens in real life the murder of innocent people and children and the pain that people have to go through every day kids having to see there parents die in front of them and call of duty won’t hesitate to put that in the game so I think that mature teens should be aloud to play this game but ayy that’s your call

There is language, I hardly noticed it during the entire campaign, but I’ve heard worse on the bus ride home from school. Blood isn’t very noticeable, drugs are present in pretty much everything marketed to 13+, so your kid probably has already seen it. I only give this a 13+ instead of a 12+, because there is chlorine gas used in the campaign and it isn’t legal during wars. You won’t see anything bad in that scene though, you just have a gas mask on and end up passing out. I think the game holds a very good message, that the governments in the US and UK are trying to take down a terror organization and restore peace to the country of Urzikstan.
I would like to begin by saying there are several good reviews out there, but also many which are quite biased and not necessarily accurate. Call of Duty's latest Modern Warfare has the 18+ age rating for a reason; an obscene amount of violence and horrors of war, such as civilians being shot and killed, children fatalities, terrorist attacks, etc. I highly respect this age rating, but also believe that teens, at the very least should be at least 15 years old. Although I would say there could be exceptions for children who are more mature and understand the whole concept of true war, for someone who understands this myself finds that the age of 15 is the minimum for this game. This is mostly due to the campaign feature of the game. (The campaign is the part with most traits of war, like the terrorist attacks, civilians, gore, etc.) As for the multiplayer, it is a much more fast paced and less blood and gore is involved. Mainly firing weapons at other players. The game, however has great messages, as well as great role models. One of which I find, is a female character who fights against the oppression of her people. There are also good themes one can take from the campaign. Overall, I would say that the campaign is for mature teens at least the age of 15, and the multiplayer could probably be around the 13-14+ age.
I think that CoD: Modern Warfare is a game meant for 13 year olds or up. I play mostly Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield 1 and if you let your kids play those games they will be fine playing this game. It does show people smoking but it never supports it. It does have a large amount of violence but you can turn of blood and language. The worst part (in terms of violence) Is the campaign but for the most part that is fine too. Just a few levels are too violent. It is a realistic, down to earth, gritty approach to the genera and shows the rolls of counter terrorism and police in today's conflicts. And an added bonus: It is so much better than Fortnite.
The game is an FPS and mainly is violence. There are a bit of f bombs in campaign. The worst thing u can really experience in voice chat is toxic sweats which are mostly 15+. Though you can just mute them. But if ur child is 11 and mature and wants the game, go ahead and buy it for them.
It’s educational
I think you should get this for a 10 year old if there looking to play the campaign then maybe 13
This game is vilant an should defanitally not be played if your kid is under 10. The multiplayer i would say players 10+ should be able to play especially if they are mature and understand that real war is real and not a game. The multiplayer is a little gory, but you can turn the blood settings off and the cussing. The campain is definitally worse with more gore,fighting, and cussing so i would say 13+.
The M rating on this game MEANS M 17+ Campaign(War is Brutal) 20+ This Portion of the game is why i have it set to 18+ if i could i would say 20+. This game gets dark extremely fast as it beings with a cut scene featuring a group of terrorists claiming responsibility for a terror attack that happened before the events of the game and ends with a Suicide Bomber walking out of van with a detonator in his hand before cutting to black. There are also scenes of torture via waterboarding, Terrorists Executing Civilians, Limbs being shot off with a sniper rifle etc. but, it does have role models in the realistic way that they portray the SAS and US Military and how they operate Multiplayer and Spec Ops(Mindless and Difficult Fun) 14+ Spec Ops is pretty much the same from the past years and Multiplayer is vastly different with new mechanics and a new leveling system overall, just use your basic instincts when deciding if you want your child to play Modern Warfare(2019)
The COD formula has deviated from what we have come to know and love from MW1, 2, etc. However, its still a really cool game to play.
WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS This year's Call of Duty isn't just a run n' gun mow everyone down game. It's a real military game this time involving tactics and quick thinking. One particular mission in the campaign "Clean House" has you deciding who is just a civilian and who's a terrorist. This mission is one of the most controversial of the campaign. It involves a woman running somewhere you don't know until she gets there (she might be running to a weapon) so you have to decide if you are gonna shoot her or not. If you don't shoot her you see that she was just running over to her baby and there is nothing to worry about. Another scene is when a car is driving in your direction and you don't know if it is civilian or not so you have to wait. (It ends up being civilian). Anyway the multiplayer is by far the best (way better than fortnite) and it's cross-platform so you can even play with friends on pc xbox and ps4! If you buy the Dark Edition of the game for $120 it comes with a set of real night vision goggles the actually work! This game is great for young teens that can handle it.
CoD MW is a reboot of the original Modern Warfare series. Its campaign is fairly dark and gritty, as it tries to show some of the horrors of war, and how war is awful. I think that this is something people should see. The campaign is violent and sometimes gives you the opportunity to kill innocent people, although you are usually punished for this. The campaign shows torture and sometimes people being burned alive. However, the game uses the Russians as the main antagonists, like in the original games (I think). But in this game, it shows the Russians doing things that the US has actually done (war crimes). And it makes them look like heartless monsters. At one point, it is stated that the Russians attacked a village on the "Highway of Death." This is something that the US did in the Persian Gulf War. So after you play it, don't assume that the Russians are evil. They're not innocent, but neither is the US. Multiplayer is good, but some guns are just kind of OP, like the M4A1, and some shotgun that I don't know the name of. A lot of people don't like some of the map design, and there's a lot of camping. I don't really have much of a problem with campers, but I totally get why people would. I, for one, do enjoy the multiplayer, and I assume that most players do, for the most part, enjoy it. Campaign is ok for a mature tween or teen, and pretty much anyone who doesn't mind blood, violence, and a bit of swearing can play multiplayer.
Great game fantastic graphics. Would rate 15+ due to the swearing and blood however kids at 13+ are probably used to it.
Modern Warfare
This game is lit
The Campaign is realistic, but the multiplier is fine.
13/15+
This game is not inappropriate whatsoever it’s educational!!!
Amazing game
Very Thoughtful, Very Real
Parental review
I like it.
Good Game, But still in progress
I LOVE this game, so much I bought it on my PC, and somehow convinced my Dad to get the game! It's a cross-play game, so you can play it on multiple platforms! My Dad, Brother (10yrs) and myself (14yrs) play this game a lot! It really brought us together! The game itself is amazing, however... the campaign is NOT for children. I found it disturbing. The multiplayer and CO-OP is ok, just turn off the blood and gore! I'd really recommend this game, to anyone... unless we are talking campaign. 12+ at least. Oh, and one of the main characters smokes a cigar once or twice.
I LOVE THIS GAME. I don’t get why people are saying it’s bad though my little brother who is 8 plays it and he hasn’t changed a bit it’s actually made him more social (playing with his class which he wouldn’t usually do) Also it has increased the happiness he has overall he and I have a great time on it.
The campaign does deal with a-lot of strong war subjects, the multiplier is fun, but camping is a issue. But overall a brilliant game, the campaign is for 15 and older, the multiplier is 12 and older.
The Multiplayer aspect of the game is fine for ages 13+ as it is like any other Multiplayer call of duty mode and does not reveal the kid to offensive or disturbing scenes, the only thing it contains is blood and simply gun violence, something that is normal for such a game and something you should expect. When it comes to the Campaign/Story mode of the game, I would say it is 15+ as it contains many offensive and disturbing scenes (some of which you can opt out on) including war crimes, torture and terrorist attacks. It shows the reality of war and puts the player directly in all of it. This could make it one of more disturbing games in the franchise such as the original Black Ops which also included war crimes and torture.
This game teaches younger kids about modern day war. The language and blood can be turned of in settings. This game should be played by people 10 and up as they will learn about the war.
The game itself if you are a COD fan is the best we've had since 2013, the feel of it is just great. This game is a bit graphic although, only in the campaign and it does give you the option to turn it off. The content when not turned off includes civilians executed point blank. dead children, one kid shot off-screen, it definitely shows the darkness of war but some people may be able to take it.
Good
Coming from a teenagers viewpoint, the story (if you want to experience it properly without cutting out any scenes or missions) is even disturbing to me, but they were going for realism. The campaign is ver real to what is happening around the world in the war against terror and it makes you think about that. There are missions where you’re forced to make very intense decisions, in one mission early on in the game, you shoot a person that looks like a civilian after they try to reach for a detonator to blow up a house that the character is in. That’s just one of the sequences, and that’s not even the worst one, maybe let little Timmy and Sally sit out on this one or find a way to make sure they only use the multiplayer which I’d say is good for about 14+.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 is a tactical shooter. The multiplayer is a fun and exciting mode with tons to choose from. Although there might be some blood if you get shot or die. (This is because the creator wanted to make it realistic). But, swearing, blood and gore can be just turned off in the settings. The campaign is quite graphic though. It displays some very dark scenes and distressing moments. But, there isn’t many of those scenes and all the other scenes are quite user friendly. I think you should only get this game if you think your child is mature enough for this game. I hope you found this review helpful.
It's a call of duty game, so its going to have some blood, but the movie Mulan has blood in it. I like it because I'm a sucker for the fps gerne. Its just over priced, not including in-game purchases. Its more of a "Yay, I got this game for christmas!" kind of a game. i think a mature 9-year old could play this, but you should just leave this one to the middle schoolers.
Its a good game, i would just turn of blood/gore settings and turn off explicit language
