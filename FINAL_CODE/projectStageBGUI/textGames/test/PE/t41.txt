Great game, but some things to know
Great game that kids can play!
The game is based off of a task force named "Overwatch" (hence the name) which is based upon protecting humanity from robots known as Omnics. Although the game contains a character with a cigar, nonetheless, it should have the Content Descriptor of "Tobacco Reference", rather than "Use of Tobacco". The game contains mild blood and gore, which is very unnoticeable. The game is, however, very toxic, so beware. Edit: I forgot to mention that there are multiple uses of the word s**t, but both are within reason after something negative happens to them.
I highly recommend this game if your kid wants to get into Shooters but does not have the experience for a game such as a Rainbow Six Siege the mechanics are great and really easy to play I love this game and I plant a lot and well there's close to zero mature content I am inclined to mention that there is a bit of violence but all of the weapons that character is used are some form of energy blaster and they're not guns and even if you're really against guns players still have the option to use other items however if you are a hardcore FPS fan I would not recommend this game for you because it will get boring for you fast I highly recommend this game for younger kids
Overwatch is a online first person player game from Blizzard Entertainment where you chose a hero to eliminate enemies using gun aim and various skill. Each character has i own skill and special which is very useful will eliminating the opposition. This is a very fun game with lots of modes but it has some problem-- hack users.this user uses hack like aim hack, which makes them overpowered and it makes the game not very fun. I think this game will be even better if Blizzard blocks this kinds of hack. However I think Overwatch is a game that is worth its price if you have a great aim and great decision making skill. This game has great graphics, lots of mods, custom matches,and also ranked matches.I do not recommend this game if you do not have good aim or you do not like cartoon graphics. First this game can be very stressful if you can’t kill anyone because of your aim and secondly people have different types of game they like and if you are expecting something realistic this is not the game for you. If you like games like Fortnite then this is a game for you-- it has a cartoon graphics like Fortnite and it also requires aim like Fortnite.
Yes, there is voice chat, but you have the option to disable it in settings.
Now, I’m a die-hard nintendo fanboy, but Overwatch has reeled me into the shooter genre with its in-depth roster and each characters unique moveset. It’s character system is like smash. Everyone essentially can do the same thing, but they do it in different ways. Only down side is the fanbase, NEVER, under ANY circumstances go there. Other than that, 9/10.
Great game, I've been playing it non stop. Overwatch is a first person shooter containing different characters you can play as, each with unique abilities. For example, there are characters who deal mostly damage, there are tanks, and there are healers. Parents should know there is open voice chat, but you can leave it if you want. The game is kind of strategic and some characters are unbalanced, which Is why i recommend this game to kids 11+, depending on their skills. But it's your decision. I think it's super family friendly. Only thing is tight skinned or a little bit of revealing outfits on some female characters, but nothing too inappropriate. You also don't really need to worry about your kid spending too much money on it, you get loot boxes containing at least 4-5 items every to you level up, and leveling up is super easy.
The game is basically an online PvP shooting game with an anime/Disney-like art style,there is a good variety of charaters with different gameplay,there is no gore despite being a shooting game,a few female characters have revelating outfits,is not mentioned on the game,but Soldier 76 is gay and Tracer is lesbian,there are comics and animated shorts who explain the story of the game
I'll start off by mentioning my background. I'm 17, got this game on my 16th birthday. My parents are VERY conservative and are absolutely appalled by gore and gun violence. Even as someone who is on the brink of early adulthood, and someone who spends their time gaming alone, they refuse to allow high-violence FPS (first person shooter games), or really most FPS at all. Same goes for something that is high in sexual content, be it with risque clothing or with sexual acts. But my parents actually approved of Overwatch, after researching it. There IS blood, but it is so small and difficult to see in the high, cartoony-action, that it isn't bothersome. Not all heroes use guns, and I find the game so enjoyable, pretty, and diverse that it's hard to put down. I will note that heroes will say "damn" in certain interactions, and if i'm not mistaking "hell" is also used. But that's it for language. Females wear tight clothing, but it isn't overly graphic. Only one hero currently reveals any cleavage, and it's pretty mild. The same character, "Widowmaker," is known for her voluptuous bottom, but it's nothing to be overly concerned with, in my opinion. All in all, I highly recommend this game. There is also interaction with other people which is always unpredictable unless you refuse to allow mic access, but the game is difficult without team communication. It is possible to find a team who does not use profanity. Children are often less good at the game, so I discourage younger ones to play competitive, but nothing stops them. Get this game for your child if you disapprove of violent or overly sexual games! You likely won't be disappointed.
Its a super fun shooting game with cool characters and skins for them! Some violence but no blood and gore. Great for kids over age 7.
this game is friendly and light. Fun to play. I love it so much. It teaches team work.
This is one of the best games I've ever played. Overwatch is one of the greatest games ever and also one of the most fun games. It is a superb multiplayer game. It has beautiful graphics, exciting combat, and a great lore. This game is centered around combat, but it's not graphic, a small flash of blood at the worst, but it is constant. Some characters of both genders wear revealing outfits. No actual in-game cursing, but there is unmoderated open chat. This game has some DLCs and merchandise including comics, books, online character shorts, and they're even making LEGO sets. This game should be fine for tweens.
The game is based on two teams of 6 battling over a common objective, however there are many special gamemodes to choose from that change the gameplay. The player chooses from a roster of 25+ characters, each with unique abilities. The variety makes the game difficult to master, but players are usually good with only 2 or 3 characters. The weapons of the characters can range from a hammer to a machine gun, and when a character is shot they can bleed red blood. The violence is not very realistic though, and I think kids 11+ can handle it. Many characters also are fighting for good and the game encourages teamwork. Fun with friends.
Overwatch is very fun and colorful, with very mild cursing and no sexual content. I think the only concern to consider when purchasing this game for your child is the fact that it is multiplayer. There is an in-game censor that obscures foul language, but that is only in the text chat. If your child connects to the voice chat, there is no filter and some of their teammates are likely to curse. Other than that, I highly recommend this game. It's been a great source of fun for me for years now!
There's nothing bad or inappropriate in this game. The violence is mild, there is no use of drugs, (except one character smokes a cigarette). However, the game has a voice/text chat that is required to use if playing Competitive Play. Competitive Play is, in my opinion, hard to understand to a 11 year old. So I think the game's rating is pretty spot on. Quick Play and Arcade gamemodes are much suitable for smaller kids. You can also come across some inappropriate custom games in the Game Browser but that's not really a problem.
Overwatch is a friendly first person shooter game with epic characters. There is not that much blood in Overwatch. But sometimes when Soilder 76 gets hit he mutters damn it under his breath but that's really it in terms of swearing. There is no drinking or drugs in the game either. And some positive messages and good role modes.
i played this for so much time that i missed my bed time, its a really really fun game, its mostly battling robots and not real people. So just get up and play!
This is a pretty fun game. There’s a lot of diversity in play, and actually no blood. The only curse words are a few “damn”s thrown around, but otherwise it’s clean. It does promote team play, which is great, but there is a problem in that it’s also an internet troll’s paradise. Players have access to both text and voice chat, so you can directly talk to other players. There is a profanity filter option available for text chat, but not for voice chat. You can mute and block players, however, so that’s nice. Players can also grief or throw games by not doing their part, interfering with allied players, and similar practices. Basically, you can say or do anything and it’s likely you won’t have any punishment besides a mute for a few days. That is most people’s problem with the game, at least when it comes to social features. But most of the time, you will find players who want to have a good time, just like you or your kid. Now, about the characters. There is one character, McCree, who smokes a cigar, and McCree and a few other characters reference alcoholic drinks, but none is actually shown in game. There is some fan service in Widowmaker (possible Mercy and Tracer, depending on who you ask), so just know that. There is so actual sex or nudity in the game. The game can also be VERY rage inducing. There are times that you may not be doing well, or your team isn’t communicating, and you just get mad. At those times, it’s better to log off and take a break. It’s also pretty addictive sometimes, so I would advise parents to set time limits. It’s for their own good. One last thing: there is a lot of consumerism. When a player levels up, they gain a loot box. Look boxes give you, well, in-game loot, like skins and sprays. But they are purchasable, and they cost a surprising amount, about a dollar a box. Since you can’t directly buy loot you want with money, you will need to either rack up currency, which takes a long time, or buy boxes, which give you totally random loot. This leads to many players buying a lot of boxes in hopes to get something they want. Overall, Overwatch is very fun, but no game is without flaw. The seemingly uncontrollable social mechanics are a problem, as well as the consumerism, but otherwise I would say it’s fairly kid friendly. For these reasons, I’m giving this an age rating of 13+
Great game, I think you should let your kids play it. P.S. sorry for any typos or anything like that, I am not a native English speaker.

Overwatch Review
I absolutely love Overwatch. I have been playing for about a year. The game itself is completely fine, minus a couple of realistic looking guns, a little of blood, and a character that says "die, die, die" in a creepy way. The issue for kids under 12 is the voice chat. There are very "toxic" players in this game, and swear a lot. I have been paired with people who say the f word every 10 seconds. However, there is a way to disable voice chat, and it won't put you at a huge disadvantage. This game teachers great teamwork, but is addicting at times.
I apreciate the variety of characters with their own abilities and lore. The game mecanics are easy to understand and even though there is a ned to kill enemy players constantly there's not too much violence in it. However the comunity can by toxic sometimes and there are some provocative character models-
Like I said in my title, you don't have to use violence to win. There is healing, shields, teleporters, stuff like that. Anyone who says this game is "violent" go get a life. And get Overwatch. Cheers.
Kaden Cline had this as 10 years old, then Kaden Cline could get this for his Christmas 2018 as 11 years old. Now, I have this. Not so much violence!
The game content is pretty poor and most players are pretty toxic. Well tbh games with shooters generally have super toxic and salty players.
I think that it is a good game for older kids, (12 and older) because it s an FPS but it is not as bad as COD. It is more of a friendly FPS because it is not a real life game, it is more a fantasy game, more like Fortnite.
This game is great! If your a gamer then this game is a great addition to your collection. If your a younger kid like me, then its still a great game to get for your birthday or something. It's all about strategy and teamwork. There are also parental controls you can apply to the account, so you wont here any bad words through other teammates. Violence is moderate, weapons are ranged from explosives, guns, swords, bows, and fists. 1 character named McCree smokes a cigar, but that's the only drug explicit in game. When players get hurt, the character may say damn or hell occasionally. Easy to learn. AMAZING game, and is worth your money.
I have gotten really addicted to Overwatch. It is a multiplayer shooter which follows the story of a team of heroes who defend the planet. The thing I like the most about this game is the emphasis on teamwork which means that it promotes this as well. Another positive is the many heroes and classes to play which makes Overwatch so fun and diverse. It is very fun and only gets boring after a long while. The violence is cartoony and there is no blood or swearing. This is probably the most age appropriate shooter out there.
This game is amazing if you like shooter games. If you are thinking about buying this game I will give you some tips. So, this game is expensive. It's 59.99 (USD)! But if you are willing to pay for this then keep reading. About the game. This game is rated T for Teen but from the gameplay, it should be rated Everyone 10+. The game has very little blood, its fast passed and cartoony. Also make sure you look at videos of this game too. Lastly the bad part. The reason i say MATURE in the title is because of the Online Interactions. There are many adults that do not care how young your child is and cuss using voice chat. Yes there is a way to turn that off, but if you don't there can be people cussing left and right. This happens on almost ANY online game you play. These people are usually cussing because they are mad that they lost or died. However there are some good people but rarely from what i have seen. Another thing to consider is that if your child does not have a microphone he can not talk to anybody using voice chat. If he does he can talk to random people. So, after all that if you know your child is mature enough for this and you will pay the price then go right ahead and get this game. (I am a gamer myself and have played many games like this)
Overwatch has a great storyline, multiplayer, and characters that you will love. Some might say it looks "cartoonish" but it looks pretty realistic. If you want to have a fun time, this game is for you.
It’s not TOO bad. I mean there’s a little bit of bad stuff but come on, most games have that
Issues: One character smokes a cigar, few characters when using the default outfit (extremely easy to obtain more outfits) some characters wear revealing clothing, but does not show up in-game frequently, and if playing on computer there is open chat that has little filtering but can be disabled. other that that it has non-realistic violence that focuses on an objective rather than killing.
I think overwatch is a really fun game, it’s a lot better than those graphic gun gamer and a good substitute! There is a character with a rather tight clothes, and a cowboy smoking, but I think a nine year old would understand the right thing to do and stuff. One bad thing might be is the online interactions, if you don’t want your kid interacting with people online, you can always disable it! Other than that it’s a great game! Sorry for any bad grammar/spelling I recently moved from Yemen so I’m still trying my best to get better at English!
Overwatch is my most played game on my Xbox one! I don't know how other kids feel about seeing or thinking about blood, now if you are, this isn't your game. If you get shot, smashed, or slammed too much, you'll die or animated blood will show on the border of your screen. Also beware of reaper, for his main line is, "DIE DIE DIE"! But otherwise good game!
I absolutely adore this game! This is one of my favorite video games of all time. For what reason? I haven't a clue! There's something about it that's so enjoyable that I keep coming back for more. However, there are a few concerns I have about this video game that could be helpful for you in deciding whether your child should play or not. First off, there is a LOT of toxic people in this game. I think it's gone down quite a lot, but it's crazy how rude so many players are. It ranges from snarky remarks to incredibly sexist comments. What I recommend to avoid torment is by staying out of voice chat and keeping personal information out of chat (Like your age, gender, etc). I also never enter the voice chat channel, so I won't hear what others are saying. Despite what Common Sense Media says, there IS swearing present in this video game. Of course players will sometimes use strong language, however, there is a profanity filter to keep it from showing up in chat. But most of the Overwatch characters actually swear. When a player receives an item called "Orb of Discord", they will yell, "Damn!" One of the characters, Genji, on top of saying, "Damn!" will also say, "Kuso!" which is Japanese for "shit." Soldier: 76 &amp; McCree (Most likely more I don't know about) also say "damn" in an unlock-able voice line. Those, I believe, are the only things that really concern me that Common Sense Media didn't mention. But this is a really enjoyable game and I recommend it!
I got this game for my birthday and was very excited to play it. As soon as I started playing it, I loved it! I play on Xbox one and it is probably the best game I've ever played, crossing with Fortnite. It is not gruesome and when somebody dies, they simply fall to the ground. I would recommend age 11 and over because it is a violent game, I'm not going to lie. The best thing I can recommend for parents is to let their kids only play it a couple of days a week. Some characters could scare younger children if they are like 7 year olds because some characters have weird voices and can look slightly scary. I would totally recommend this game for pre-teens/teens but you must know that if you have a head set or a microphone people are able to speak to you and even if you don't you can still hear them talking. Just don't reveal private info and you will be fine! This game can teach you about team-work. The guns aren't violent looking but look very futuristic, that is the base of the game, looking like the future
Overwatch is a great game for people just getting into first person shooters (fps games). I think this game puts out a really good message that you can do anything if you work as a team! The game does not have any gore at all, but you do have to shoot people but with thing from bows to ninja stars etc. Even though this game has violence it is very cartoony so it should be fine for anyone age 11 and up!
For a start, it's an amazing game. But there's blood. Not exactly but you see a puff of red when you hit somebody. Plus, there's red around your screen when your at low health. Apart from that the game itself is awesome. You just gotta be quick when choosing characters or heroes as there can only 1 hero in each game. It's available on pc ps4 and Xbox but is pretty costly.
cartoonish realistic violence makes this game very kid friendly, also the fact that its easy to learn how to play, although, i think that the competitive side of it makes it less so and brings out the competitive nature in children. Moving on to the lore, the game has great role models as one character is a lesbian, another character is a really strong woman and a peaceful robot healer/monk overall, i believe this is a great game with great role models and ease of play
