Mild Gore with Mature Themes
This game is good
all the age raters are crazy
Not as bad!
good
way to much language for a christian.
One of the best games of the year with strong language and powerful themes
It is a great game for mature kids
Would translate into a 16 movie
Not that bad at all
If you seriously think a kid should be able to "handle" mature content you are stupid. Terribly uncomfortable situations with incest, implied sex, etc (and doesn't include the language and violence). If your 12 year old can "handle" that, then I feel bad for you when your 12 year old is 15-18 years old.
A bit crazy but overall good!
Good
I am a lifelong gamer and I enjoy sharing games with my kids. However, I always play them first especially when it’s a company like rockstar games. I love their games, but they’re not suitable for kids. Red redemption 2 is just a slightly more tame version of grand theft auto set in the old west. You can murder people at random with multiple weapons and in multiple ways and although sexual scenes are not clearly depicted as they are in GTA, they are very much implied in RR2. In the saloon, women ask you if you want to have a good time and you have the option to decline. Also, there are bath houses within the hotels where ladies ask you if you need assistance bathing for a fee. If you accept, you observe the female character reaching into the bubbles between the male main character’s legs and asking if he would like to be scrubbed anywhere else. This game is open play, so there are infinite things to explore. For those parents saying on here that there’s no innapropriate content for kids, my suspicion is that they simply haven’t explored all of the game’s infinite possibilities in open play. You really have to get around the environment, try every door, every store, every service... My opinion, after playing about 6 hours of guilty pleasure into it and thoroughly enjoying the game; I will NOT be allowing my 13 year old to play it.
This game has great action and adventure. There is a lot of violence. There is some rude language and sex stuff but a great game( probably best for adults though)
Red Dead Redemption 2 is an incredible game. The graphics are amazing, and the storyline is gripping and very enjoyable. However, this game does include mature aspects. I’ll run over some of the things to look out for. Drugs: In certain locations there are dedicated Drug stores in which players can buy Horse stimulants, Human healing items and even Cocaine gum and tobacco. Players can also be seen smoking from cigars. However I don’t feel like this is a problem, as the player isn’t seen snorting cocaine for example. Gore/Violence: It’s the Wild West! Expect blood splattering from faces, knives being stabbed into necks and humans found hanging from trees. Heads can be exploded when using certain guns and their headless body can then be seen on the floor. Arrows penetrating skulls, and screaming as a human is mauled to death by a wolf. Sometimes, a slow motion replay is played in which you see the bullet hitting somebody showing blood splattering. Aswell as guns and bows and arrows. An array of melee weapons can be used, like hatchets and knives. You can also hold people at gun point, and proceed to threaten them and/or beat them, choke them or shoot them. You can rob stores, trains, civilians and houses. Upon committing crimes, if seen you can be wanted by Lawman and Bounty Hounters. These men will come in horses, rifle in hand so it can be stressful to escape or fight back. Language: Uncommon use of the F word, but a very common use of Bastard and Son of a bitch. Shit is used at times. But nothing more than what a 12 year old has heard already. Nudity: Some references to Sex and prostitution. In one scene, you are knocked out and raped. You do not see or hear this, but upon waking up from being knocked out you work slightly funny suggesting something along these lines has happened. This scene is avoidable.. Animal penis can be seen. But go to a bull field and look in real life, it’s nothing unusual. Gambling: You can play Poker and Dominoes with in game currency on the line. This can be avoidable and is necessary. Drugs: 5/10 Violence/Gore: 9/10 Language: 6/10 Nudity: 3/10 Gambling: 2/10 I recommend this game for people 16 and over. As at the end of the day it is animated. Although very realised as long as you can distinguish real between fake you should be fine. However regardless of this, I do NOT reccomend this for anybody younger. The game is stressing, very realistic and all in all not pleasant when engaging in gory situations. All this aside, one of the best games ever and will engage you completely.
Firstly for PEGI the game should 100% be rated a 16 but for ESRB the game should be from TEEN - MATURE and common sense seriously don’t want any kids playing the game they are listing things that are incredibly rare to happen and the game is optional so you don’t have to anything you don’t want to. Any 12 year old would have watched something much worse whether it be a movie or even on YouTube. You should definetly let your kid play it if he’s 12+.
I genuinely believe this game is not that bad! People make easy assumptions about this game being made by rockstar and all (rockstar made GTA V) but it is nothing like it the gore is more detailed due to graphics advancements and you have less choices on being bad like your character cannot have sex whith other characters. The worst thing that you can do is hog tie civilians to a railroad track and watch them get run over which I don’t think should happen. This game is recommended for mature kids and I would wait to see if they are ok to handle it. This game is amazing and fun and kids deserve this .
loads of people can play this family friendly game with a bit of violence
left and right g*d D*** its kinda like gta 5 when it comes to language but overall good game. barely any nudity except a rape scene if you choose to help. Man genitals and butt in a scene. and lots of drinking. i would say this game is only for 18+.
I have beaten the game and there is hardly any nudity only two scenes briefly show any nudity. the only nudity you child or you are likely to experience is the horse testicles. The game is violent but there is an honor system and if you kill a lot of people you won't have a good honor bar and the ending will be affected in a negative way also you will not be able to go to certain parts of the game, because you are wanted. This game is phenomenal and the world is the best have ever seen, and while there is strong language I'm sure that its nothing your child hasn't heard before. and if they haven't make sure they know that these words are offensive to some people. There are almost no racial slurs the only one being a derogatory term for a male Mexican and a black man/woman. The game also touches on the importance of loyalty and helping others. Overall this is the best game of the year for me anyways and it is appropriate for like 14 to 15-year-old and above.
This game is a masterpiece. If your child plays gta v or any first person shooters they can most definitely play this. There is one sex scene where you are drunk and you walk in on someone. This only lasts 10 seconds and if you do not go into any of the rooms upstairs you won't see it. While you could go and kill a whole town, the game rewards players who make good decisions by giving them cheaper shop prices and other things. There is alcohol and cigarettes but as long as you tell your kid these are bad, they will be fine and there is no more than in your 12 rated films.
I feel like there is certainly mature Content here but if it was a movie it would be a 16. Apart from violence and gore, which is subjective to your child, you walk in on a couple having sex. You see other genetalia but it's all very tame. Some people saying 8 years old need to get their act together but I believe children are mature enough at 14
This game is a complete masterpiece, there is some cowboy swear like shit. I am actually impressed as how very little sex there is compared to other rockstar games. You can also use drugs and alcohol. There is violence, but it's nothing a normal 13 year old can't handle. Then the main character, Arthur Morgan, often feels bad after commiting dishonorable actions, which is a good role model. Great Game, not that bad.
18+ not for kids
Hear me out
Language
is it OK for a pre teen
Fine
OK for mature Teens
Great game
Great game
Great game, little sexual activity!
You parents are bad parents if you think this game is alright for kids kids this game has nudity sexual content lots of sexual talk drugs and alcohol strong language blood and gore no kid under 18 should be playing this I played all the way through and have seen all of what it has not for kids
Monitor them. Mistake that’s supposed to be 11 up
I know 6 may seem extremely young for an m rated game but anything can be fine if they are supervised enough wall playing
There is a lot of language in the game but the kid has probably heard a lot of it anyway so it’s probaly fine unless you don’t want your kid hearing that stuff
In my option I say yes a mature preteen should be able to play this game by then they should be mature enough to handle this title there is only a few f bombs and there isn't much sexual content I can only think of two times and it didn't show any nudity it is also very fun and you child will be on it for a while considering it has a 60 hour campaign not including anything else i say let your kids play this if they are mature enough
If your kid can handle violence and language your fine
this is one of the types of games were you make your own choices You can just Rome around the west on a horse or murder people. The campaign has some swearing but middle schoolers have heard all that at school before. There is also like a second of non sexual male nudity but overall it is fine for mature tweens
Super good. Language, Violence is the same as any rockstar game. The one thing that shocked me is how little sexual stuff is in the game. Nothing a mature 12 could not handle.
Great game. Language is pretty bad along with violence. Nothing to terrible compared to some games/movies. Very little sex compared to Rockstars other games. Mature 12 year old can handle it if he or she knows what wrong vs right.
The only thing I am worried about for my kid is the nudity. I know that he can handle the language, violence, gore. The nudity is what worried me a bit. After researching quite a bit I have learned that there is partial nudity shown and a man and a woman engaging in a sexual act. This is only seen for a few seconds. When playing the game you can not ever have sex with anyone. Male genitals are shown but in a non-sexual way. I think a mature 12-13 yo should be able to handle this game.
Not appropriate for younger kids
Just Dance 2019
Siissidkksjsssa
Just Dance 2018
Great game for just about everyone
Although there is an option to choose a "Kids" or "Just Dance" version, the "Kids" version is incredibly cheesy and more for younger children. The "Just Dance" version has more songs for older kids but limited song choices. The outfits in most songs are inappropriate and most of the songs suggest sex or drinking. It's really hard trying to enjoy dancing with my 10 year old daughter when what we are dancing to is so provocative. Nope! In order to have more of a song variety, you have to buy the subscription to unlimited. Otherwise, you are trying to earn more songs.
JUST DANCE 2019 is the latest entry in Ubisoft's long-running, best-selling rhythm and dance gaming franchise. It's time to hit the dance floor once again and move to the groove of 40 different dance songs, featuring artists such as The Weekend with Daft Punk, Britney Spears, and K-Pop sensation BIGBANG. You can choose your dance routine or let the game learn from you and make personalized suggestions catered to your style and tastes. Parents can get the kids in on the fun and get a little extra exercise too with eight exclusive choreographed routines focused on healthy movements, created with the help of kids' development experts. And since no one should ever have to dance alone, load up the free Just Dance app on your iOS or Android smartphone and bring up to six people to the dance party. — What’s in the game? Minor Language - Very mild language (e.g., "damn") occasionally pops up in song lyrics. Some of the song lyrics occasionally reference drinking alcohol.
I think you should check the songs before someone plays it, it causes flashy lights bad for your eyes sometimes but not many it's still a children's exercise game.
The newest installment of one of the world's most iconic games is great! Great songs. However many songs have some swears and or references to drinking/sex. Words like Damn ,Hella, Bed, and Motherfricken are uncensored.References to chugging vodka, Waking up in a mans bed, abusive girlfriend as well. There is a kids mode however for the little ones. Overall this game is must get this holiday season or just in general.
Very challenging and dark game for older kids
So Good it Started a New Genera of Game: A Review for Parents that are not Familiar with this Game
Good for the uninitiated. Good for most teens.
Not very offensive or violent, some slightly questionable visuals and actions take place but nothing too bad, if anything it's more scary and atmospheric. Very hard and challenging game for younger people, I've beat it twice now and only with me giving him some tips has my son beat this game (he was ready to give up).
In my opinion, at the time of the original release back in 2011, it was visionary. It is absolutely brilliant in the way it treats the idea of RPGs (role playing games) and action-RPGs. People will still be talking about this game 50 years from now. Because of this game, there is now a genera of games being developed and released called 'Souls-Like' games. It is the successor to a game released way back in 2009 for PS3 called Demons Souls. Originally, there were no plans to release 'Demons Souls' outside of Japan because the makers of Demons Souls, 'FROM Software', felt that the extreme difficulty wouldn't appeal to Western gamers; especially those in the USA. Some copies of the game, still not translated from Japanese, made their way around and it quickly gained a cult like following. The aspect of the game that appealed to gamers around the world was the extreme difficulty and unforgiving nature of the gameplay; the very thing that prevented international release! So, after some time, a USA release was announced and then an eventual European release as well. The game sold modestly in USA and other countries but the revenue stream was significant enough that development for USA release began on a game that took the concept further. Not a sequel but a 'spiritual successor'. People who enjoyed this game and the sequels that followed got to experience something that had been missing from games for a long time. That being, a huge challenge with no hand-holding. There were 2 sequels (3 if you count Bloodborne, some count it, some don't) and then this remastered release. The improvements in the remaster over the original are improved multiplayer, improved framerate, slightly improved graphics, and port on a new platform, Nintendo Switch. Overall, the game looks more polished but there is a minimum of graphical improvements. However, the frame rate problem in the original is no longer present and the multiplayer/online is greatly improved. -This game is violent but it wouldn't be considered realistic violence (like robbing a bank, shootout with the police etc. like in Grand Theft Auto). The situations have never occurred at any time in the history of Earth. -The vast majority of enemies that your character must deal with in a violent manner are only vaguely humanoid or not humanoid at all. Without going into the the story-line they are more akin to skeletons or zombies when humanoid and simply monsters of one type or another when not humanoid. -There are no firearms. The weapons consist of swords, clubs, battle-axes, shields, etc. There are also bow and arrow, and a minimum of crossbows. The characters which the player creates from the ground up also have an option to use various magic and miracles as a means of offense, defense or support. -There is no nudity, sexual situations, romantic relationships, or foul language. -The 'blood' expelled when hitting an enemy is not realistic and simply serves as an indicator of a successful hit. It is more of a particle effect. In other words, there are no 'wounds' made visible on your enemy after attacking them. This blood effect can be turned to 'light' (which makes the blood appear green instead of red) or turned off completely. The blood is implemented in such a way that it really makes no difference if it is present or not. If it was turned off in my game without my knowledge, I most likely wouldn't even notice. -The subject matter is of a dark, dismal, sorrowful and morbid nature. The themes are most likely above the heads of small children. This game is most likely not for young children. Not because of the violence but because of the difficulty and dark nature. It will be especially difficult for someone who has never played a game in this series. There are no prompts or indicators of what you are supposed do or where you are supposed to go, other than vague dialog from various characters and item descriptions. In fact, outside of item descriptions, the story or plot is all but nonexistent. The character building and leveling of character and weapons would be difficult for a young child to figure out. There are no instructions explaining it either. The game would be more frustrating for a young child than disturbing. There is also online multiplayer. It can be either cooperative or competitive. There is a system that allows you to meet up and play with specific people, like your friends. But for the most part, online interactions are anonymous and random. A frustrated player, barely making through will likely get invaded and killed by a more experienced player. These experienced players can spot a newbie and often like to toy with them. I would imagine this would be even more frustrating than the game is already. If you die, you lose everything (collected souls and humanity, which are forms of currency) and have to start from the beginning of the level (last bonfire rested at) unless you can make it back to your blood stain (the place at which you were killed) without getting killed again. I would say a (mature)12 years old and up. Again, not really because of violence or subject matter but because of difficulty, ambiguous goals and story, and level of patience required. A young child, under 12years old, would most likely be either bored or frustrated. The game will severely punish players who are impatient and run into situations swinging their sword. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest games and series of games ever made. They have ruined me for all other games. If a new game comes out that interests me, (which is rare) I will play it for a couple weeks and then go right back to Dark Souls and the related games in the series.
The 60 FPS is good addition. Especially a game as precise as this. Too pricy tho. Other than remaining glitches that its the same uber-tough 3D Metrovania/ARPG fun for new fans. Blood can be turned off. Small blood splashes with regular hits and large ones with parrys and backstabs. No gore save for a hydra boss' heads. Some enemies can be butthole stabbed. Pretty humorous but can be wince inducing. Some enemies desintegrate into dust rather than blood. Macabre imagery of the dead, decayed, burned, spiked. Obscured spider boobs and harpie butts.
