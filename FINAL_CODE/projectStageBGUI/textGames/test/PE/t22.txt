Even though it has violent weapons, I think it's 7 and up because it includes teamwork,survival,and fun. That's why I think it's 7 and up.
Somewhat repetitive game that's too easy to cheat in.
Great Game!
Children exposed to adult content
Great game for kids
good game always ban someone if inappropriate
Its a good game- But has a lot of things your child should NOT be seeing.
Not safe for kids! bullying, sexual conversation, language, account phishing
Is good or bad to play Among Us?
Not violence
Among us permissions and reporting.
Outstanding Game with Interesting Idea.
It's just the chat
!--Among us Overall--!
Best Game EVER!!!
Not for the innocent
Appropriate for almost everyone
It's a really good game, altho some players might use foul language but hey that's the internet. Apart from others players using profain it's all good. Oh and let's say someone uses the f word it would be writing like this **** . Or maybe ****ing b****(the f word and b word). Yeah something like this and some people dont wanna see that
The game is alright with friends, but don't go into public lobbies. Not because of the chat, as that can be censored, but because of the cheaters. Hackers are only a very small problem in this game, but normal 10 year olds cheating ruins the experience for everyone. In terms of being inapropriate, there are a few iffy kill animations, but nothing an 8 year old can't handle, and also online chat, which can be filtered, but be cautious just in case
So, I see a lot of parent reviews saying this app is 14+? Like really? I'm 15 and I actually play this game with my parents and my younger siblings . Parents need to clam down on the chat feature like teach your kids to report people and ignore chat. Parents saying violence is and issue? If you watch your kids watch superhero movies you should have no reason to speak about the cartoon violence. I personally love this game and recommend to parents to let their child play!
As I played this game to see what it was about and make sure it was safe for my kids, I was proposition for sexual activity. I was asked for outside screen names and contact info by others players to have a more private chat. None of these were advances made by me. The people who were doing it were just asking everyone for their info. Sadly, there were children, girls and boys, giving out their information to complete strangers to contact them. Not only grown people preying on younger children but also saying inappropriate explicit sexual activities just in the chat. They would pop in a chat and start talking inappropriately and keep doing it until they were kicked out and sometimes, other players would join the text. Although this is such a fun game to play, it will expose your kids to things only adults should be a part of and also put them in a position to be preyed upon. The good part is they do make private rooms where you can play with people you know who have your invite code.
A great team building game. It has lots of logical thinking involved. Great to have chat filter so I know my kids are safe.
Among us is a teawork game were you have to figure out who the murderer is! I personally love the game. Most of the chatting is about who the murderer is. also you can ban or kick someone if they are being mean or inappropriate! Its not hard to play on mobile idk about pc though!
Ok if your scrolling down and seeing other ratings about which age you should be to play, You might see a few saying 7+13+ 15+ 17+ but this is the official answer. This game Among Us, has a LOT I mean a LOT of profanity. But there is also a censor chat option in the settings but that will just censor swearing. There are insults as “Go kill yourself” “go burn and rot in hell” etc. This game also includes Knives, murder, and guns. I recommend 18+ or older. This game is also very addictive your child MIGHT start acting up or their grades will drop. If your child is mature you can let him play it but make sure the censor chat is always on. It might look like a innocent cartoon looking game but in the inside of the game, (this game is online) Peoples ages are over 15 sometimes even in the 20’s in this game. Rarely young kids, Sometimes peoples username can be offensive such as “Your mom” Even sometimes their own Phone number in their names! The players in this game share their instagram usernames etc. Sometimes predators. Well if you finished reading this I hope this helps you decide if your child is able to play this game or not.
I thought this game was safe as it is a cute cartoon game so I played myself as I do before I let my kid play anything. Immediately I noticed a bully going as far as telling someone to kill themselves. There is no account system, therefore no way to report or track someone for abusive activity. Within a week someone had lured me into a lobby, switched to private so no one else could join and started lewd conversation. I jumped out of the lobby and not long after that it happened again. This time I was asked questions about about account names and personal information. The only sensor system takes "bad words" and replaces them with ****, which can be tricked by replacing a letter in that "bad word" and the system doesn't work on the player name, which you can change as often as you like. A user could potentially bring your child into a lobby, they change it to a private lobby by pressing one button so no one else can enter, then start making sexual conversation, bullying your child with abusive texting or trick your child into giving out sensitive information or even physical location then switch to another lobby with a different user name within a second. If you feel like you absolutely have to let your child play this game I would recommend watching closely, only allowing your child to play in lobbies that you are in with them on another device (this is pretty easy because of cross platform play and a simple game code to enter a lobby) or having them only play private lobbies with people they actually know. It's disappointing that the creators so irresponsibly, openly expose kids by allowing free play and no account system because this can be a fun game if you find a lobby with people mature enough to play the game responsibly.
I'm 12 I played this with my aunt and her boyfriend, I used to hate this game but now I absolutely love it, now if any kids are under 10 you really should be care full because when I played SOME people like 1% of people say really nasty things and curse but you can have chate filters on
From my point of view, this game is really good to play for kids because they develop communication skills and they see how is to work together. I played one of the online game on Gameszap.com and after I saw that my son is very happy when he plays it, I order the official game.
This game is not violence unless you get killed or you are the imposter.
I think we should be able to report certain people not only for hacking but for toxic hosts. I have been in lobbies where I get kicked for something as small as being too good or smart, and for them being salty about them dying or making a wrong move when i was actually right in the situation. It is no fun for them to kick me and have them be satisfied when they should have to learn how to play instead of kicking someone too good, its almost like "bot lobbies" as in other games, but they just ban me and i have to wait for a whole new lobby and it gets tiring. Not only because i have to hope people will join that lobby but also because I would be doing good and they don't listen to me when i speak politely and simply confidently and they get mad and ban me for no reason because they made the wrong move.
Among Us is fun, and I can't see why it wasn't popular in 2018? It was released in 2018? Okay, lemme get to the point. The game itself is addictive, you either play as a crew mate doing task, or an impostor who is trying to kill off the entire crew to win. Only thing I'm going to say is upsetting is that adults can make it around the chat censore and ruin the game. So I'm going to say let them play it, but make sure your kid is mature enough not to repeat foul language, inappropriate names, cartoonish blood, ect.
The game is fun and finally something different from Roblox.. But the chat opens doors for anything. *my daughter's experience: she is 11 and someone put their phone number in the chat. Being 11... She texted the person back and forth for a few days. Once I saw the texts I put an end to it, but had I not been on top of her it could have been bad. Hopefully it was just another kid, but there is no way of knowing.
Here are the explanation for each factor in the game. __VIOLENCE:__ The attacks are very quick and brief, showing only a small red blood indication, though the team you're on indicates the attack animation. __LANGUAGE:__ The chat filter is automatically on and blocks all profanity. The only way to see inappropriate language is to manually turn the setting off. Misc: Among us has no points or earnings for success through violent acts like other games, so it is very unlikely to influence the child into violent activities. If you don't want your kid to become a master at lying and deception, or if they already have a problem with this, Don't Let Them Play.
Very family friendly game and just as violent as Star Wars
the game is really good but there is too much violence
I personally got this game because my younger teen brother downloaded it. After several games, I was immediately horrified at what my brother downloaded! There was strong language usage, vulgar references, and just overall awful stuff going down in the chat. This was in multiple games! I had one clean game out of 10 total games! The game itself is not bad. The chat feature on the other hand is not for children or teens unless very very closely monitored. Also contained lots of blood and violence.
There is a open chat otherwise there is nothing wrong there is just a bunch of cartoony characters
I definitely recommend!!! You and your kid will enjoy this game!

Beware of the chat
Hi I have a 12 year old daughter and a lot of people in her class were talking about this game, so she asked me about it, I researched it and some reviews said too violent but it’s cartoonish and fun, if you’ve let your kid watch Star Wars and they weren’t scared or anything this game is totally fine! The little astronaut guys are adorable and it’s a fun mystery game to play! And there’s a censored chat option! Perfect! And you’ll make you’re child very happy because if you remember being a kid it feels so fun to be included in a fun game that everyone else has, and if the game is appropriate then you should get it! Overall Among us is an amazing game!
I think it’s okay, it is a bit violent but no guns and no blood. The fun cartoons are cute and I think this is suitable for 9
My 14 year old son seems to really like this game. As a game, it's fine and I don't have any concerns. However, I do not like that there is an in-game chat (text, not voice). Players are able to use inappropriate language in their username or in the chat.
A fun game that allows you to introduce your kid to your childhood
VERY FUN GAME!
No more gambling
Disturbing: What's with the "you're hot" comments???
Parents need to chill...
I was about twelve when Pokemon Red and Blue came out, and I remember I really loved it. I saw that there was a new rerelease of that classic game, so without thinking, I plopped the $100 edition in the cart for my daughter (and me as well). When we got home, we revved it up and started playing. It’s pretty fun, and I’m not sure if it’s just because I’ve gotten older, but it seemed pretty easy. They took away the battles against wild Pokemon, and replaced them with something similar to Pokemon Go’s system. Everything was alright until we got to Misty’s gym. The people there were a little scantily clad imo, but it’s fine for the most part. It remained a cute game, until we got to Celedon City. They took away the damn slot machines. I remember really enjoying that, but I guess it’s fine. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is Lavender Town. Anyone who played the originals growing up remembers this place. The creepy atmosphere is jarring, and the somber tone of the story there is really out of place. I wish they had made it less scary, like they did in Gold and Silver. The story with the Cubone made my daughter cry. I couldn’t help but remember all the scary stories I heard about it on the playground when the originals came out, so I fear what my daughter will hear. Googling scary Pokemon stories gives a lot of graphic results, so I’m worried about that. Overall, this was a fun time. I got to relive my childhood, and introduce a new memory to my daughter. I will definitely be picking up the next one.
JANE, ERIK AND I ARE ALWAYS PLAYING THIS GAME TOGETHER! IT IS VERY GOOD! TEACHES GOOD CHRISTIAN VALUES! MANY CUTE PETS TO CATCH! IT'S A GOOD GAME! NO SEX! NO SATANIC LANGUAGE! JUST GOOD OLD PEOPLE AND POKEMON! THERE ARE A LITTLE TOO MANY FIGHTS, I THINK. IT COULD DO WITH A CONVERSATION MODE. THAT WOULD BE FUN! THOUGH, I LIKE THE LACK OF THE WORD "KILL". IT INSTEAD MAKES POKEMON "FAINT" WHICH IS BETTER!
Pok?mon yellow is rated for 12+ but let's go removed the gambling
My kiddo is 8... and some of the content seems "not age appropriate"... Example: what's with the "you're hot" comment one of the characters makes to the trainer that is my kiddo's character? Anybody else experienced these weird statements? I'll change my rating and age appropriateness as soon as I get an answer to this.
That one reviewer is overreacting. Fire being a symbol of Hell??? Then does that mean if I use a charcoal grill with flames to make BBQ that I'm somehow not Christian or a devil worshiper? And what about smores which normal people make over a camp fire? Also you don't "kill" the Pokemon (not "Pokeman" as the idiot called it) you throw a ball to catch them. You never kill the Pokemon even when you are actually battling them. When Pokemon are defeated they are not killed like the one reviewer alleged, they faint/pass out from exhaustion. The guy who made the Pokemon series actually said that he made it to where they don't die so that kids won't associate death with losing. Plus if she was actually watching her child playing, she would see that the game has positive messages about friendship. And if she thinks that this is violent then she shouldn't let her kids play games or watch TV period. Mario has ghosts and fire pits and levels that resemble Hell and yet she picks Pokemon to bash for doing what movies, TV shows and games have done for years. Don't listen to the overprotective person because you should use your own judgement. I find Mario to be more violent than this and most people don't raise an eyebrow at the violence in that. As for concerns about animal cruelty not all the Pokemon are based off of animals. Magnemite is a magnet, Exeggutor is a coconut tree, Tangela is made up of tangled vines, and Mr. Mime is a clown and Jynx is a human-like creature that could be considered racist. Jynx would be the only concern I have since she used to be black faced but got changed to purple because they didn't want it to be too racist looking. The only other thing I can think of to be worried about is that the game is too expensive and the ball accessory bundle is almost twice the price of the game by itself. The ball gives you a free Mew but it's not really worth it.
