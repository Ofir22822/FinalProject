Overall, a solid game! Give it a try if you're starting out on RPG's or a Pok?mon Fan in general.
Just going to get this out of the way.

Yet another Masterpiece!
A fun game that lives up to the Pok?mon expectation
As a veteran player, this game was on the easy side of the difficulty scale but is suitable for younger audiences. The game characters themselves tell the player character to expect the battling to get tough throughout their Gym Challenge, which is a nice touch. Most, if not all, characters are lively and are friendly towards the player character. The rivals of the player character never have any ill will towards them for besting them in Pok?mon Battles, and all strive to better themselves in a positive manner, which isn't at all uncommon to see in the Pok?mon series. If you/ you and your child care about the fact that over half of the Pok?mon that exist aren't obtainable in the base game, fear no more, as the expansion DLC that is releasing in two parts, later this year (2020). The DLC is going to add in brand-new content, as well include AT LEAST 200 more obtainable Pok?mon, some of which will contain returning Pok?mon, a Pok?mon with a new Regional Form, and completely new Pok?mon. The DLC expansion pass is constantly advertised in a banner in the in-game menu, SOMEWHAT pressuring players to buy it, but the small banner could be temporarily (shows back up each time the game is booted back up, which could be annoying to some, not to me, really) turned off by clicking the Right Stick. Now to denounce other people's reviews! The review addressing the lack of gimmicks from previous games is kind of bunk, as it's simply "out with the old, in with the new". The review speaking about characters "scantily clad with two-piece swimsuits" is also nonsense, as the "some characters" (the Water-type Gym Leader Nessa, the females of the Swimmer trainer class) only wear swimsuits that one would typically see females wearing at a pool and/or the beach. Nothing to be alarmed about, honestly. Yes, the graphics could be better by today's standards, the story is simple to a fault, and there has been glitches and bugs reported, but nothing game-breaking. The smartphone app Pok?mon HOME (releasing Feburary 2020) will help with the transfer of Pok?mon from older games into this one.
there will be many negative reviews from those who haven't played it. So I'm here to combat that.
I played the pokemon games on the DS and gameboy. I totally skipped the 3DS line and was excited to see how much pokemon evolved after almost 10 years...and I was so disappointed. I tried as hard as I could, but I could not bring myself to like this game. The gameplay is similar to past titles with turn based combat. "Routes" are still present but extremely linear and bland. You most likely will never revisit some routes because there's absolutely nothing to do on them and nowhere to explore. Pokemon do not interact with the environment like what you'd expect. Pokemon had never been known for its stories, but SWSH's is extremely boring. Usually I'd just skip through it, but the game babies you and the "story" seems to interrupt you every few steps of your journey. The graphics are horrid and ugly. My father had walked in while I was playing and mistook the game for a Wii game. Animations are lazy, lifeless and take you out of the simulation entirely. Overall, the game is way too easy and holds your hand the entire time. Not fun in the slightest...but fun to make fun of. I'd recommend picking this up if you're into competitive pokemon, into collecting, etc. If you're a casual fan who will put the game down after finishing, don't bother. Younger kids (5-9) may really enjoy this though!
You can be scammed when trading, can make you mad during battles when someone has an overpowered Pok?mon, other than that great. Also, names of Pok?mon can be inappropriate.
there's no gore, no violence, sexual content ETC ETC It's just not a good game. if you're a younger kid who just wants to collect pokemon and be the champion and all, this game is perfect, but for anyone who wants anything more, try another game like black and white or ORAS. they ruined "shiny pokemon" (rare special versions of pokemon that required often hours of work to acquire) by making it as simple as one person spending an hour or two, then upwards of 30 shiny pokemon being generated, and they refused to patch the glitch that caused this. the story is abysmal, the one in the previous games (sun and moon) was great! but they didn't try this time. It's also way too easy. I played through the entire game and only lost once, which would be ok if it was still a long game, but it's not. if I lost every fight it would still take me about 10 hours to beat the game, it's just way too easy. if you're looking for an easy, simple game try this one, but for a good, enjoyable game maybe go for the fan favorites, (black and white, diamond and pearl, heart gold and soul silver) or my personal favorites (omega ruby and alpha sapphire (ORAS)
Easy 2 play, beat the game in 40 hours. Highly recommend to ages 8 and up!
No gore and super kid friendly. The Pok?mon battles can be challenging, but I was able to beat them all on my first try. As long as you like Pok?mon and know how to use a switch controller, you will love this game.
This is literally the BEST video game I've ever played. Totally worth the money. It also has a great DLC! And the best part is that it has a whole continuation of the story Post-Credit.
It's a fun game, but is harder to control for younger kids. There isn't too much to do after you complete the game, unless you buy extra stuff.
First of all, I've played almost every Pok?mon game since Red + Blue The game is enjoyable, but compared to old entries to the series, I found it quite dissapointing. Most of all, I disliked the pacing of the 'story', because it all happens in the last 10 minutes of the game. If you want to play Pok?mon, you should probably just get Sun + Moon instead, they're better in my opinion
I have Pok?mon Shield myself, and I think it’s pretty good! The animations for Pok?mon moves aren’t really scary or violent at all, and the gameplay and story is fun, but yeah, the idea of training animal-like creatures for combat is a little extreme, but parents shouldn’t not get this game just because of that. But on the other hand, if you don’t know your types or aren’t used to Pok?mon and battling other players online, it can be a little frustrating, but overall, if your kids are Pok?mon fans, it’s a good game to get as a present, and is easy to learn how to play.
It is a fun game but sometimes stresfull
I really love playing this game, the graphics are great, the camping and cooking minigame things are cool, the story is pretty good but almost the same as other games as far as I can tell. These games help younger folks learn about the value of teamwork and such. Also the Dynamax mechanic is cool PS Im sorry I have no grammar skils whatsoever
This is my favorite Pok?mon game, I do miss mega evolution and some other things from previous generations, I don’t see why this game has lots of hate, but besides that, this game is for kids but with some very mild problems that just depends on your Conscience, this is a short swim suit outfit that you can get from beating the 2nd Gym (Nessa) which is revealing, there is also no filter to names, so you will definitely find some inappropriate user names while in Internet connection mode but honestly that’s it, this is a great Pok?mon game for people new to Pok?mon, tho I don’t agree with the price (59.99 USD$) I still love the Pok?mon franchise This game also has inspiring messages and a great story, and you can learn good lessons form this game
Along with all Pokemon games, this one is a masterpiece. Great for all ages. I highly recommend diving into this wonderful world, and enjoying what it has to offer.
I wouldn't consider myself a super fan of the Pok?mon series, but I have taken a liking to the games. I've played many of them, but I have never seen a game as beautiful and smooth-running as this. The game follows the story of your character and his/her rival, Hop, questing to become the newest Champion of the league. I haven't finished the game as of when I post this, but so far, it is the best Pok?mon game I have ever played. It has an amazing storyline and positive messages about never giving up and trying your best. The only thing I would say is that only kids 8+ should play this because firstly, the controls are a little bit complicated, and secondly, there are some mildly scary scenes that I think anybody 6 or under might be scared by. But aside from that, this is the best Pok?mon game I, personally, have ever played. The developers really did a great job.
It is a great game although there are women that wear bikinis but little kids don't know and it always happens at the beach. come on
I am a huge Pok?mon fan this is grate for all people 6 and up also the game is rated E.
The game Pokemon Sword/Shield is a adventure/role-playing game where you explore, challenge gyms, and most importantly: catch Pokemon! If you are not entirely sure what Pokemon is, Pokemon is a game that was made in the 1990's that is practically the same as this game other then the fact that there were way less Pokemon then there are now. Honestly, this game is really good, the animation and graphics have received a very much needed update from its previous titles. (There are many different titles in the Pokemon franchise) The story is pretty good compared to some of the previous games, but not the best. The pokedex has a even number of 400, which is awesome! Something that they added to the game that I love is the wild zone! The wild zone is an area that you are free to explore whenever you feel like it, so kind of like a open world area. One thing that has not really changed over the years is the Pokemon battling, it is very cartoon-like and not very graphic using a rock-paper-scissors style of battle. Overall I must say this is a fitting game for the Pokemon franchise, If you are a hardcore fan or new... then join the fun. And welcome to the world of Pokemon!
This game grabbed your attention and doesn’t let go! The kid friendly, fun nature of the game that has come to be expected from the Pok?mon brand, with kids of any age looking forward to play the game. Fans of all ages can play Pok?mon sword/shield, and different levels of completion can be achieved depending on how you like to play the game.
Ignore the hate, Pokemon Sw/Sh is great
As someone who is a fan of Pokemon, it lived up. Graphics are sure, not impressive but very vibrant and colorful, could use some polish, New Pokemon are unique and the new stuff added will depend if you like it. Ignore the hate from the fans, it is great.
From what I’ve seen
From what I’ve seen it’s a good game but shouldn’t be used for people who are too young because certain things are inappropriate for them I feel it’s more up to the parents if their kid should use this but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone under the age of 12 but i’ve only played it a little bit so take this with a grain of salt
celebration of japanese idol culture with some flaws
The game has some aspects it nails pretty well (for example the fights themselves, which are full of colorfull effects and just overall fun gameplay especially the session mechanic is really fun), but also others (mostly the dungeons) which just feel bland and boring. Overall good, but nothing outstanding.
fun
yay fun
Not tame, but not too crazy
Most violent one of the series
Yes.
Japanese GTA is a tad bit tamer, still not for young children.
I first played this game when I was 16, Majority of the reviews I read at the time claimed violence as extreme as Mortal Kombat X, but that was not true by a longshot. There was no intense blood or gore, still even a little could be a disturbing sight for kids under the age of 12. many of the reviews I read criticized a part in the story (trying to keep this spoiler free) where a man cut off his own finger. However, this action was off camera, and you did not see his injured hand nor the actual finger. The story was great. 10/10 the best game in the series, also the best game to play first. There are some women in bikini outfits but no nudity or real sexual content, another thing that reviewers and the ESRB were going off about. Would recommend to ages 14+
You can tune down blood amount. Although attacks can still be cruelly violent. Strong language is frequent, but heard in Japanese(still seen in dialogue). Smoking and drinking is done by main characters. But story is very great, engaging.
As a teenager who played worse games before this (GTA, Saints Row, Etc.) this game is pretty tame compared to them but a hell of alot more fun and a more interesting and intense storyline, it's not some shoot-em-up GTA style game instead, this game is actually good, it has the right about of story telling as well as gameplay which is mostly beating people up, though there's side quests and optional things like Karaoke and dancing. In my opinion, even in the Yakuza setting you're still playing as a good guy, in this particular one you play as two different men who have to battle their hardships to save the ones they love.
There are no explicit sex scenes/nudity in Yakuza 0, so if that's your main concern with games like GTA 5 this is a great alternative. However, there is still strong violence, language (again, not anywhere near as much as GTA), a minigame involving flirting with bikini-clad girls, and the ability to get drunk. Good game for those who are old enough to handle it.
