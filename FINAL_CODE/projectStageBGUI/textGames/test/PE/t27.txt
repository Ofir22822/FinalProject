Great game but inappropriate for young children
Alright for a child entering middle school.
Let me talk
Surprisingly Acceptable
Graphic sex scenes.
Petty of commonsense
Way more tame than Call of Duty and other M games.
This game is not as mature as you think
Ram Ranch Really Rocks
Maybe a little bloody but nothing you haven't seen on TV.
red dead redemeition
There's nothing "mature" or "adult" about this game. I tried to give it a try on account of my wife who got it for me as a gift. I knew it had a tendency to cuss, but thought I could change the language to Spanish or maybe skip those scenes, but not even close. Right from the start they lay it on heavy. Every word you can think of. I'm not playing the hypocrite...putting my kids to bed so I can stare at this game. The 5 minutes I did play were boring anyway.
Has many positive role models and shows kids how to be responsible. No blood or anything of the sort and any responsible 6 year old can handle this game. Hope your child has a fun time with this one.
This game is not bad whatsoever. Other people may say it but this is not true. Nudity is essentially 0 unless you happen to walk in this room during one part where all you see is a women's bare back. Horse genitalia is in it but that doesn't matter. Violence isnt bad whatsoever, not much blood or wound marks, plus your child chooses whether or not they want to cause violence and I dont see why they would. No violence equals in game bonuses. Even the game supports not having any violence. Swearing is more minimal than you might expect with mostly just g*dda**it and sh*t. I've played this game quite a bit and heard 1-2 f bombs throughout the whole thing. The game gives you the option to be good or bad and it is much more productive to be good so the M rating is basically just there for what you can do. In most cases, there is no violence at all. There is drinking and tobacco use. It's the wild west, it has to be historically accurate which this game very much is. If you have a 10 year old+ son and dont let him see drinking he wont adapt very well as an adult.
Time and time again, my son has pressured me to get games that I feel are unfit for him; he constantly asks for games that have way too much blood and gore, but after playing the game, I see that it I completely appropriate, the violence is toned down beyond recognition, alcohol is only used by "the bad guys." Overall I think that the opinions highly underestimate the maturity of young teens, or even tweens.
I play this game and I have to say it is amazing I’m an 11 yr old and there is not much sexuality
Overall, this game is handled very well by my 32 year old. He understands the general purpose of the game, and it does not seem to teach him anything bad overall.
Look. I agree with a lot of common sense 18+ ratings, but this is one that just doesn't deserve it. A mature 14 year old can definately play this game! I think even a 13 year old could play too as long as they have supervision. The language is not a big deal. If you listen to middleschoolers on the playground messing around you would be more shocked at their language than the language in this game. As for the nudity, it really isn't bad at all. The nudity consists of a pair of horse testicles, and one scene where you save a women from being assaulted. The combat is what you would expect in a mature game. This would be probably the reason most parents will not let their kids get this game. The truth is if your kids play games like seige or battlefield 1 it's nothing new. The difference is your character actually has consequences for his actions and killing. Your character feels remorse if you do something bad, and you get to choose your own path. You can help people less fortunate in this game and make friends. Each decision opens a new door. It really is a great game. You get to know all your gang mates, and you get to do nice things for them and play games. For all the parents who are worried about how you rob banks in this game think about this. It is a dang Western video game! Of course you are going to be looting and causing some mischief. A positive thing to come out of playing this is you learn about how it was back then in simpler times. You learn some history, and the amazing graphics make you feel like your really in the game. Of course in combat scenarios there really is not too much gore. Unlike GTA there is no guts unrealistically flying out of people if you push them over. Just maybe a little red like all other shooter games. I encourage you parents to get your kids this for christmas. They would be missing out on a great game that teaches you that all actions have consequences. Thanks for reading.
this game had blood and and nudity in it and my 20 year old slept in my room for the next 3 months
best game of all time
This is a wonderful game, with the best and most realistic scenery I've ever seen. It is completely immersive and includes an unlimited amount of tasks from doing chores to help the camp to hunting and fishing across the giant map. It takes 15 minutes of real time to ride a horse from one end of the map to the other. However, the main character encounters, and sometimes causes, extreme violence against all sorts of folk. At one point he helps kill half a town, including all the lawmen, just to break his insane colleague out of jail. He slightly admonishes his colleague for murdering two extra people just to retrieve his guns, but that's the extent of it. At another point, while simply roaming around, I encountered a person who had been strung up under a bridge, decapitated and missing the lower half of their body. Inside the head's mouth was a note from the murderer. For people worried about sex or nudity, there is very little. And the gratuitous and graphic violence is potentially much more harmful for young children than any of the minor sexual themes. Also, the language is as bad as it gets, but again, is nothing compared to the gore. I put 16+ because I think most 16 year olds would be able to handle this game without any more damage than an adult might endure. But each parent should evaluate their own child's tolerance for violence that could be traumatic or desensitizing. Again, this is a great game, but know what you are getting. Almost every "shoot 'em up" game on the market is less violent. Except GTA5 of course.
Introduced this to my child as a lot of kids had been playing it at his middle school, and I watched him play the first 30 minutes or so of the game. At first I was sceptical about it as it was made by the same games company as GTA 5 and I would never let my son play that. But soon I recognised that the game doesn’t deserve an R, as although there is cocaine gum in the game as an optional choice, it mainly punishes the player for using it and gives positive messages for this. One of the reasons why it’s rated R is that it’s violent, but violence is an optional choice much like the drugs, and still punishes the player for this and the player can be sent to jail. Therefore worsening the gaming experience. This game is a choice game where you can be good or bad, and influences making the right choices. As long as your child doesn’t choose the wrong decisions it’s suitable.
4 may sound low but this game is e if you want it to be
I am currently a mother of 3 children one of which is 13. The release date of this video game happened to be his birthday and he really wanted the game. I had never let him play a rated M game ever and I could not believe he would ask me this. Even though I did not want him to have the game at all, I did some research and the game is actually acceptable for his age. There is minimal swearing which he is already exposed to, and the violence mostly involves lassoing up a horse, or disposing of a bandit. The game takes place in a western era and is a great history lesson. A lot of laws in the old western era are taught and so is independence, strength, confidence, animal care, among other themes. I will not neglect the fact that the game involves western themes that parents may find negative, but if your kid really enjoys video games he/she will most likely just focus on completing the task at hand instead of obsessing over the one subtle cuss word muttered in the background of the crowd your walking through. Please consider purchasing this game, for it made me feel a lot better that my kid was happy on his birthday. Also it may be the only appropriate rated M game in a while so...
Any prent who recommends this is ok for anyone under 16 or 17 is delusional. There are many many sex acts in the game. Lots of cussing. Do a quick google search for red dead 2 sex scenes and you will find several. Peeking through a window watching a man on all 4s in bed being spanked naked or a woman in full nude riding a john in a bed. They are not cut scenes.. they are part of the game. Come on parents... set some boundries.
It is in all honesty petty for common sense to give this an 18 rating, along with esrb. This limits a above average should be teen game, to an audience of 18+, it should be at most 13+. I played the whole game from start to finish, and I am aware of all of the blacklash from parents because of M rated games. I understand they don't want their child to play games like Call of duty, as that provokes violence, however, that is not apparent in this game, you don't just shoot people, you have a morality system, the game punishes you for mindlessly shooting people. This game does not provoke violence, it inspires people to be kind and good, which is heavily implied by this game. Also, this game has the lowest form of violence in all honesty, little splatters of blood here and there, and most of the language is occasional and mild, like damn and crap, (which are in games like spiderman.). Why, they say those words less than spider man, a teen rated game. This game has no sexual content whatsoever, I did not encounter any sexual behavior, or scenes. The most graphic thing in this game is blood splatters, in all honesty. If you are a parent who looks at the esrb des. LOOK MORE INTO IT, IT IS EXAGGERATED. THIS GAME SHOULD BE TEEN
I am a parent of 2 and I have looked into this game for my 13 year old son, as he never typically asks for m games, (which I expect from him.). He has never owned an m game before, and has watched about one r movie in total. I looked into this game expecting it to be inappropriate to the extreme, however I was wrong. There is no sex whatsoever in the game, as I have watched videos on it, there is no n word, and the game is barely violent in terms of guns. There are virtually no swear words. I do not know how this game is able to warrant an "M" rating, it should really be T:violence. My son does not play any m games, but I would give this an exception. I might have to steal this idea from another review, but it makes perfect sense violence 4/10 little blood splatters but nothing too bad languages 1/10 They say D*mn every like hour you play the story mode Common sense is wrong, there is no n word themes 2/10 There is no bad themes, their are positive themes like womens rights. sex 0/10. No sex
I am a parent of 1 boy, and I never let him see r movies, hardly and pg13 movies, and he is not allowed to play call of duty or any other m games. However this game changed my view as I viewed it, and I did not hear any instances of the "n" word, and barely any other cuss words. I did not encounter any sexual themes,(the 0.2 second blurred sex scene was removed.). Or not required. And there is a few splatters of blood that did not seem to violent. So I decided to let my 13 year old get this game.
I am a huge gamer and I absolutely love this game. It is a much better and a much more appropriate version of GTA 5. People think it is by the creators of GTA so don't let their kids go and get it, but not really. Their is so much violence in GTA and the point of that game is to kill people but Red dead redemption is about making friends and living a life in the west. There is a little bit of swearing but it really isn't that bad because you can play an online game and there will be real people cursing on their mic and that would be much worse than this game. The biggest turning point is the drinking, but there is so little of it in the game and it is bad for your character that is kind of just their and pointless. The blood is like the blood in the Fallout series it is in very quick portions so it is kid of hard to see. I would give it the same rating as fortnite because fortnite is about killing everybody but is has no blood. If you let your kid play Fallout 76, Fortnite, Assassin's creed and Call of duty the game should be completely okay.
i think its a good game for kids with no sex sceans i have completed the game and the game is over all a very well done game
