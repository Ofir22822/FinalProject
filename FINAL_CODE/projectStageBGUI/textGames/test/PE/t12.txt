Live an Avengers Adventure!
Really good game. 4 character co-op mode is fun. Reminds me of the old TMNT or Gauntlet games. A huge gallery of characters to choose from once you defeat them or reach certain levels. The violence is anything you would see in any superhero fighting game. No blood. Just knocking people over as their life status bar wears down. The main thing I was surprised by is the high usage rate of the word "hell" in the game. In names of places, items, and characters saying "What the hell..." I suppose it's considered a mild swear if at all anymore but it's enough that I don't want my 6 year old hearing it.
Cool
Games speaks saying Give Me Money!
Buy it
Unless you are willing to put money into the game to buy a world lock the game is unplayable due to the fact that you have a bunch of trolls coming into your world and causing havoc by breaking your things or setting your world on fire with lava. I just downloaded the game and got rid of it a half hour later because I got tired of people just constantly breaking my stuff and placing lava blocks all over the place. 2000 diamonds for the world lock and they only give you 30 just to get a small lock which does absolutely nothing.
DQB1 was great, DQB2 is terrible
Very Dark Themes
Great good feeling game
This game is just plain bad and I'll have a go at telling you why. 1. DQB 1 was almost an openworld game, in which you could follow the story and progress through it, while taking breaks to build your town as YOU pleased. For my kids who love minecraft this was a huge succes. DQB 2 does NOT allow you to do this. In this game you basically have zero free will and are expected to comply mindlessly in order to progress. Think minecraft, but with a Korean telling you what to build every step of the way. 2. The humour is awefull...It's almost entirely toilet humour, jokes about poo and jokes about spying on girls in the shower (lots and lots of those in different variations). 3. While the game could choose to show gender roles as equals throughout the game, it mostly has the female cast running around in playboy bunny outfits (yes litterally with the bunny ears and everything). Heck, one 'great' event is a party in which the main female does a burlesque like dance to the hooting and cheering of everyone else, while wearing her bunny outfit. 4. Considering the messages this game sends to children about women in generel and how closed minded and linear everything is, it feels like the main purpose is to teach children to do as they're told, while pushing a rather tardy view on women.
If you have concerns with allowing your child to be exposed to the dark arts, and many very dark spiritual matters, don't consider this game. On first glance this game looks fantastic and is very fun, with some concerns throughout the game, but by Chapter 9 it's excessive and very problematic with no way to continue the game by avoiding it. Beware!
The game is full of positive messages. It will be hard for a kid that can’t read because there is much reading to do. The writing is funny and engaging. The game keeps you constantly engaged and it’s fun to see all the characters interact with you. It’s safe for kids! And fun for parents. Even if you don’t like Minecraft, this game will have you building in no time! It’s also a great introduction to rpg elements and the Dragon Quest Franchise.
Got it, love it!
Fun for all
Good but a fair amount of violence.
Got it for my family recently, we all love it! Very fun time playing with my kids, a great game for any tween!
I love this game for my kids it's very fun and we all love it
It's a fairly good game if your kids know about alcohol/tobacco and know the difference between video games and real life. There is some violence depending on how you play, and some mild pixelated blood but overall great game, shouldn't be much of a problem for mature tweens.
This game is very good just not for little kids
Shocked by this review. First of all it appears the reviewer does not understand the game at all. Second yes the game is very hard which is the point it is a sim game not an RTS. The game is taking sim city or banished and building on that with simple RTS mechanics using an AI enemy that never stops spawning. In essence you end up with a slower version of a zerg rush (starcraft) attempting to thwart the growth of your city which has ever increasing demands of food and energy... etc. Between each wave it is your goal to push your city walls out such that you have access to the needed resources to increase your tech tree and space to build the necessary housing and infrastructure such that you can keep up with the ever increasing waves of enemies. until your final wave which is a relentless hoard that is timed as long as you make it to the end of the timer you beat the board no mater how many layers of your city you have lost at this point. The reviewer appears to have missed this and assumes that the point of the game is to win or maybe as we used to say "beat it" but that is not the point there is no level progression in this game it is very much made in the fission of a genera of game that is not common but was rampant in the 1990's. Though not for everybody the game is excellent so long as it is played on a computer the console controls leave a lot to be desired. Also i would say anybody below the age of 12 is gonna have a lot of trouble with a game like this. (sorry for the typos i came across this at work and just had to say something on here for the parents looking for a fun game or anybody who came across this as their only review of this game. Ignore the person who reviewed it unless you want this for a child under 12.)
its a great game
This is a great game me and my kids love
its the best game I have seen let your kids play the game
This game is ok for children of any age over 11 and overall pretty good
Very Good for children 9 and up.
It shows that life isn't always how you want it to be. Kids should know that while he/she is growing up. Especially at ages 9+.
Amazing!
Yes
Fun game
Educational value should have 5 dots.
It helps a kids imagination, Totally recommend
Second best game ever next to Minion Rush
Very fun game, Has very mild violence, It can be ages 8 and up.
How does this get 4 dots for education, the fact that violence gets 1 dot, it should have no dots. Seriously, Common sense, you need to improve your expert reviews, and add a new thing that gives you a choice to vote from 0-5 dots, and the overall votes is the dots out of 5.
the gore and blood can be turned off
The game is very slow compared to other fighting games, but this isn't always a bad thing as it gives you time to think. Easy to pickup, yet hard to master. Also, I disagree with what Harold cooper said, while the blood can be turned off, some of the characters may look scary to younger children. Some females are slightly sexulized in looks. If your children are mature, however then its fine if you let SOME kids under 13 play (namely 11 12 13).However some people may consider the game over the top in violence, (not that true as some previous games were more over the top).
Terrible piece of garbage full of bugs
This game is full of bugs and glitches literally when playing this on my ps4 my game crashed 6 times after playing for 8 hours that’s when I just rage quitted the game and am never gonna play again it’s a waste of money a lack of f**king that the developers put towards making this game it’s no wonder why the game has a score of 64 on metacritic it’s a pretty shitty game honestly and a waste of money and time don’t buy this game you will regret it.
Jason!
A Killer Game Worth Playing
Good game, with choices and consequences
Alright for kids
This game has no inappropriate content
Very good game but can get quite freaky
Heavy Rain will pull at your heartstrings!!
Incredible game
Depends on your child's behavior and maturity
Fantastic, well-written dark psychological thriller game with unique twists.
Not for Kids
This game is fantastic, but not for the younger audience.
I never played the game, but I watched a walkthrough
Sexual content makes it very mature.
not for kids.
fine for ages 14 and up
A game like I never played.
Heavy Rain is a game about a father in search of his son who was kidnap by the Origami Killer. He has help from his friends but its not an easy task as everyone they meet is a suspect. The story of this game is very good. The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is not too bad. Theres a DLC that's worth getting too. Although good and one of the best game to come out, this game is not for children because this game has a lot of swearing, some sex scene and nudity. Also theres a lot of violent scene and drug use. This game is not intended for children, parental guidance is strictly recommended.
The game is about your choices and the reactions other people have to them. After I played this I let my 13 year old son play and I think it taught him a lot. I think people say games like this are too mature when they are not and I think it’s appropriate for someone above the age of 12. I mean, they know what sex is, and the references are few and far between.
It depends if you are a parent alright with it
I absolutely love this game. ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Soo, if you cry easily you might not make it through this game. It's a beautiflly done story about testing how far youll go to save someone you love. It does have quite a lot of death scenes, but gore really isn't present. However, someone is strapped to a table, with a drill about to go into their hoo ha. Nothing is shown but for her beating up the dude :) THre are drugs and alchohol, because your characters with drink every now and then, and one of your characters tales some sort of drug to constantly keep his mind correct, but the drug part is avoidable. There are a lot of scenes with naked people, however, it is mainly them in the shower, but there are some sexual scenes, where Madison ( your character ) is forced to strip down at gun point ( don't worry, she beats the dudes ass ) and how two people have sex, but just legs and naked male top is shown. For the overall maturity, it get's into detail pretty quick. It feels so real when a character dies, or when someone that matters in the game dies, because it goes into detail pretty well. There are cries and screams when your son it hit by a car, and when someone cuts off their finger, they cry pretty loudly. So uhhh yeah its a great game also, check out Detroit Become Human bevause it is made by the same people. Buy this game for your kid if they are mature. A fifth grader might not be able to play this.
I think this game is amazing. It’s a story about how much length a father would go to save his son. There is some sex, good amount of language, and other adult subjects but I don’t think it’s anything someone 15 or older couldn’t handle. The story is a choice game so you get to choose what happens and I think it’s unique and fun to play. It can be emotional and depressing sometimes but the story is great and realistic. There is quite some violence but i don’t think it’s too bad. It teaches people you never know how long you’re going to have someone in your life and the characters are interesting. I would totally recommend this game!
This game is absolutely amazing, great story line. However, if you feel that your child is immature i wouldn't recommend this game. There is bad language, nudity, violence and sex. This seems quite bad however all the nudity can be avoided, you just simply choose not to shower with Ethan and Madison. The sex can be avoided as well simply by not letting two of the characters kiss when given the option. If you want a certain ending you will have to make them kiss, that's all they will do and none of the sex is shown on camera. The violence is pretty much the same as most games now days, but less than games like Call Of Duty. The language really isn't that bad compared to other 15 rated games. This game does have quite a dark storyline but it is a fantastic game so if you feel your child is mature enough to play it, let them. I let my 14 year old daughter play it and she absolutely loved it. It all depends on your childs maturity and how much you trust them not to copy some of the actions. This game does have an overall good message though about seeing how far you would go to save someone you love.
Heavy Rain is an incredibly unique type of game where the actions you take are like options, where you decide to pick which of those options are the best and most wise. The storyline, plot and setting is great and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, including unraveling shocking and unexpected twists throughout. However, this does not mean it's for everyone. Heavy Rain is a very dark, psychological-horror thriller type of game which centers around the actions of the deranged and sadistic Origami Killer, whom tortures and murders young children, and it's your goal to seek justice in stopping his reign of terror and murder. This alone tells you immediately that this game is definitely not for kids and younger teens - best for mature older teens and adults. It contains sequences of strong graphic violence, disturbing and gruesome images, torture, and detailed grisly images of the killers victims. Be aware of the strong (sometimes frequent) profanity involved (uses of the f-word, gd, sh*t) and yes, there are some quite intimate and graphic sexual scenes including nudity in the game, including one character death scene that involves necrophilia. Heavy Rain is an video game meant for adults because of the strong violent content, disturbing imagery, language, sexual themes, nudity and drug usage. At least 17+
Wonderful game, great story and character. It is a pretty hard game if you play it on the hard settings, which i recommend for the experienced player. When played on the easy settings it is a very easy game. Everything about this game is top notch, defiantly a game for the more intellectual player.
In the version I saw, the main characters had their weaknesses, but struggled through them to help others. Ethan Mars goes to extreme lengths to help his son, Madison Page sacrifices a lot to help Ethan, Norman Jayden gives up his drug addiction to help find the killer, and Scott Shelby goes out of his way to protect a prostitute and a cashier who&#039;s being robbed. It plays out very similar to a movie. there is a dramatic beginning, opening titles, rising action, a definite climax, and then a satisfactory conclusion. The plot is about an attempt to save a young boy&#039;s life and stop a serial killer, so the messages are positive. The content, however, is major red flag for some ages. Content Summary (NOTE: all the content below is taken from the walk-through that I watched; thus, there may be more or less, depending on the choices you make) Drug Content: Moderate-6/10 Norman Jayden is addicted to a fictional drug. He takes two trips, and is tempted to do so other times. We see him experiencing some negative consequences as a result, including hallucinations and blackouts. Language: Major-7/10 About 50-100 profanities in all. Some uses of f*ck(including a couple combined with "mother"), as well as sh*t, and other milder language. Sexual Content: Major-7/10: Ethan is seen nude in the shower(we see bare buttocks, but no full frontal nudity). Madison is forced to strip down to bra and panties by a thug with a gun. She is also assaulted by several rapists, who briefly paw at her torso(she&#039;s wearing panties and a tank top). She&#039;s also knocked out by a elderly doctor who then slowly runs his hands along her body(his doesn&#039;t last long). Shelby enters a prostitute&#039;s apartment, and she references sex, but this doesn&#039;t go anywhere. Violence: Extreme-9/10: Shelby, Madison, and Jayden gets into several brawls, punching and smashing opponents. Ethan also injures himself multiple times(we see violent wounds after a car accident and again later when he crawls over glass). There is one extended shootout, with at least a dozen gunmen taken down. The most disturbing violence includes a boy and a woman(separately)getting drowned. One man shoots another point-blank in the head(execution style). The most graphic moments are when a man is run over by a big truck and we see a blood puddle, as well as when a woman stabs an old man in the heart with a drill(he falls on her, adding to the disturbing quality). Also well worth noting is a scene in which a character has to cut off his finger. He grabs his little finger with pliers, and after a long build-up, slams his fist down on them, crushing and cutting his finger off(the impact is felt, but not shown). In summary, great game for mature audiences.
Heavy rain mixes both Violence and sex into the game. Much like God of war. But this has a lot of sexual content. Someone forced to strip at gunpoint and topless women. The more the merrier. The violence is a bit high but its no more than you'd see on an average CSI:Miami program. The language isn't too bad at all. Its not that bad, The sex isn't as bad as said but it still lingers.
I love this game. It stole my heart and I believe that it was made solely with me in mind. The game is great but it's not for anyone under 16. There is quite a bit of nudity, a sex scene, heavy laguage and violence, and the setting and themes are too dark for young teens. I think that this an adult only game, but I would let 16 and 17 years olds play too with a little trust.
heavy rain is a thriller game that has a dark story line about a serial killer murdering young kids and parents with this type of storyline you know that this game is not for kids this game is only for adults and parents you need to know that heavy rain has a lot of intense violence a lot of sex and nudity shown also characters used constant strong language throughout the game and characters drink and smoke throughout game the story in this game is very disturbing what you are trying to do is trying to find out who the serial killer is that preys on young children and then kills them and you have to solve crime scenes and finding dead children laying dead in the rain trying to find any clues on who the origami killer is.
i love this game and believe that parents should have faith and let their kids play this
I can safely say I have never played any other game like this. If you are a person who just plays a game for its gameplay and not its story, then this is not for you. They don't even call it a game. They call it an "interactive drama". The game tells the story of tracking down the Origami Killer from the perspective of four different people. I really shouldn't say more because I would spoil it. The gameplay consists of you pressing the buttons on screen and making the motions that the game tells you to. The story can branch off into multiple directions based on what your actions are. One or multiple characters could potentially die and they are gone from the rest of the game. The game does have a few sex scenes and one nude scene of a girl taking a shower. There is some violence in the game like people getting killed and some fist fights.
