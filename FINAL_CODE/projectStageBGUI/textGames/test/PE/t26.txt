Don't know why it has such a bad rep
Monitor your kid whilst he's playing if you don't want him seeing some gore or stuff - other than that, fine.
If your kid can handle a little swearing and some violence, they’re fine.
Red dead is a amazing game

Before you say no to your child please read this.
Yes, it's a well made game, but for Christian families....
Great gameplay little to no Sexual or nudity Immersive and sensetive story
Love It This Game Was So Masterpiece And Esstential Of The The Best Game Ever
Must be mature
Honestly I see nothing wrong with the game. I've been playing it for a good 30 hours (15 in campaign and 15 in online). Campaign is much more inappropriate, so if your child can't handle sex or gore either sit down with them and talk or tell them to only play online. In online it's a lot more toned down and less nude or gory. But definitely let your kid try it out if you already have the game or let them get it.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fine game that I believe can be given to any kid who can take some violence and F-bombs. Gore is very small - maybe a blood splatter or two from bullets but ultimately, nothing that could give your kid trauma or something. Sexual stuff - Yet again, it's one of those things you have to look for to actually find. Whilst the player can take a bath, a woman (fully dressed) can enter if the player allows her. She will then help clean the player, but no real nudity can be seen. Another time, a small, small, rare situation can come at camp when somebody flashes somebody else (with their ass) for a few seconds. Rare though. A morality system is in play that could teach kids right from wrong, and gradually, the story builds off your honor. Those with bad honor eventually go down a bad path and have many woes occur. However, those with a good honor who help people will eventually come out on top. Good message, and good role models. Get it for your kid.
If your child has played any other game in existence that is rated M then this is fine for them. There’s a lot of drugs but they’re all optional.
So far I’ve spent around 5-6 hours playing it and the worst thing in it is just a bit of blood the worst swear word u hear is f**k but that’s only used in reasonable situations eg: your being ambushed but hearing f**k is nearly as rare as getting a perfect condition deer pelt with a car it rifle It’s a really good game and I think it would be a shame if anyone missed out on it
Has little to no sexual content and i think a mature 10 year old can play it
It is fun and not bad and you should look into it
Ok. If your kid is mature, you’re fine. The game will be ok with them.
Brilliant game not too bad on language or sex (unlike GTA) but it is violent
The main character has an amazing redemption arch atoning for his past sins, the characters in the game are all well made and rounded to have good and bad sides. The game overall has good themes and lessons such as Redemption, loyalty, trust, lessons about women suffrage and racism. Overall a great game and a wonderful experience, not to mention a beautiful open world and the most immersive game I’ve played.
The game isn't really that bad, I beat the game one time and nothing really bad besides some swearing.
This is a massive open world game where you can explore the open country as a cowboy. There are many fun story missions to do along with countless side missions. Stunning visuals. Great story. As far as age ratings, 13 is just perfect. I went through the whole game seeing no nudity besides the back side of someone for about a second, and the language is mostly cowboy insults and occasional s**t. There is violence because it’s in the Wild West, but you’re fighting against bad people and are never made to harm helpless people, in fact many missions in the game involve helping people who are in peril. You can drink beer and get drunk, but that’s normal cowboy behavior and it’s optional. I hope this helps.
Highly underrated. An amazing campaign which moved me to tears. Online aspect poor but Rockstar obviously focused on the campaign.
Honestly I think this game is wrong to be rated a 18(m) As it is only slightly gory and has a few swear words but it also shows the importance of friendship and loyalism and while you can tie people up and drag them behind your horse for example that isn't a necessary part of the game and if you trust your child to be matuer it is a great game it also accurately and beautifully covers the issue of the natives fighting a war with the us army, as your character you are helping the natives reclaim stolen land and sacred objects. I would also hate for a child to miss out on this game as the storyline is entertaining and fun yet emotionally deep to the point of tears and the graphics are the best I have seen In conclusion it would be horrible for a mature teen to miss out on this amazing game because of the age rating on the box.
If your kids can handle the language and the violence of blowing peoples heads off with shotguns it's for you.
In my opinion this game is just amazing. It is suitable for kids who 11 yrs old and above there is no bad scenes what so ever. At its worst there is only shooting i mean what do you expect form an old western game. At the end of the day i thimk its totally worth it to buy a game like this for your child especially if they are 11 yrs or older.
....it's not something our teens should be playing. Profanity is flippant and rampant. The F-word, racist name-calling, and every other profanity imaginable. You can murder anyone you wish to. You can steal. You can cause mayhem. Is it well made? Yes. Is it a blast to play? Yes. However, does Jesus call us to higher things? Absolutely.
This is is pretty much just a masterpeace on my perspective.Little to no sexual content. vVolence and drugs other dangerous substantive, are of course in there its a westeren. Optional to drink or do drugs and swear to other NPC. Tell you a story that good people do bad things my child and i love this game
For starters, this game is amazing. The graphics are almost perfect and you have over 60 hours of complete gameplay. I think your child must be around 13 years old to play the game due to a few factors such as language, nudity, and violence. As for language, there are a lot of cuss words, but we are also talking about a WESTERN GAME. Of course there are going to be cuss words. So far the only words I’ve heard are a few f-bombs, s-word and b*tch and b*stard are used more often. In the game there are also a couple of drug references such as tobacco and alcohol, but once again, it is a western game that takes place in the 1800’s that ANY mature child can handle well. Nudity, there IS NOT a lot of. There is one scene where a woman is on top of a man, but that only appears for one second in the game. There is another scene where a woman washes your character in a bathtub for money, but there is no nudity it is all covered by bubbles. In a saloon, women ask if you character “wants to have a good time” but you have the option to decline. Once again, someone who is of a mature age can easily handle situations like this and there is no NUDITY but only sexual references. As for violence, there is a lot and cannot be avoided because it is something you need in order to get the most out of your game. Gore isn’t too bad. When you shoot a character, all there is is a smile blood splash and after they die, there is usually a small puddle of blood. When hunting, there is an option to skin your animal you’ve killed for money, and that’s usually the worst it gets as for violence and gore. Overall, just make sure your child is a mature age and can handle situations that I’ve listed.
Mature kids 13 and over
Seriously, it’s THAT good!
Amazing....
Amazing
Hidden Pentagram!!! Beware
Amazing Western Shooter Game
I depends
Nothing a mature 13 year old can’t handle

Red dead redemption 2 is good for all ages
Should not be mature
Age 9 and up? Really, parents?
Adult content NOT suitable for kids
Great and appropriate game
Parents, please read before you say "No!"
I love this game
Automatic thinking a great game
Nice
When I say 13+, I am talking about the teens that are very mature. They should act older than they are. With that out of the way, this game is my favorite game of all time. Best graphics ever in a game. Best single player ever in a game. It’s not worth the fight against your kids.
This game gets an undeserving amount of medium ratings, but let me tell you right now... what Rockstar hs created right jere is a masterpiece. I’m drunk rn at 2.30 AM typing this, because someone has to say it. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t buy this game... Okay, maybe one reason; if you don’t got time to enjoy the true experience, don’t buy it, but if you do... oh boy. This game is like something pulled out of a dream of mine. Every attention to detail is so apparent, but yet so hard to see. It’s like they’ve really put their souls into this game, and it shows. It had life, story, contrast, debth.. everything. All in all, 10/10. I’d pay 200 dollars for this game if I had to.. and that should tell you alot. Kudos to my brothers at Rockstar games. You did it again! I’m out
This is not a game, its an experience. I honestly do not know how God of War won Game of The Year over RDR2. This game has some of the best storylines, gameplay, characters, and immersion that I have seen in a long time.
A great story better then most movies and tv shows. You play as Arthur Morgan a outlaw in the dying west with a group of other intriguing characters behind him in Dutch’s gang. The story just doing all the basic missions are over 60 at least hours of gameplay. Anyone who played the first game will likely know the ending but it is a fun ride and well worth the money. The message is also good even if it’s a little corroded with how you choose to play the game.there is about five seconds of total nudity but it can be avoided if you don’t go to any of it the rooms when your drunk with Lenny. Characters also drink and smoke but none of it is anything you can’t walk outside and see cigarettes and beer at a store or gas stations so it’s not a big deal. The game is great and extremely fun.
My son LOVED this game until he watched a you tube video on how to get to other spots on the map. We found out that there is a Pentagram that the game calls an Easter Egg that is hidden in Butchers Creek. It comes alive and lights up so you can sacrifice things to it between the hours of 4:00 and 5:00 am. I also found that this game is endorsed by Wiccans. I found a Wiccan blog that gave specific instructions on how to activate the Pentagram. This is NOT ok!!! After finding thisbout, we are throwing the game away. It’s so sad that this was in there, it really was a fun game
I have no idea what CSM meant by a 5 for language. I haven't heard one f--k in my 30 hour play through. Violence is definitely the main concern here. While most of the normal shootout are pretty tame, with small red clouds for each shot, when slo-mo cinematic kills happen, it gets more violent. Blood spurts out from wounds in bigger amounts. This isn't too bad- until you use a shotgun. The shotgun can cause giant wounds and excessive blood, and if its aimed at limbs, it'll blow them right off. Aside from that, knife kills can be brutal, but there is less blood and no gore. Drinking can be done as well as smoking- you can get drunk and high. Sexuality is very mild- women can wash you, and there is a brief moment in a mission where a women is seen riding on top of a man naked, with partial nudity. The only other instance sexuality is seen is when you stumble upon a two men watching a women spank a man through a window.
I feel that in comparison to other game created by Rockstar games it’s peace though it has a long plot and beautiful storyline that many children would overlook. Children now especially teenagers have already seen things like this even worse from television can be more sexually explicit than most video games. But in the end it truly depends on how your child is take this information. If you think that your child isn’t mature enough to handle this I wouldn’t suggest you buy it.
Violence is portrayed throughout this story, however you can have different approaches to the way you act. You can help your gang fight the other gang and occasional the police, or you can help the police fight off criminals. A lot of the gang fights are longer distance so you don’t see blood, however in close distance you can. You can beat and kill people at your own will but you don’t have to, but sometimes you have to beat or kill to move on with the story. There is a lot of drinking and smoking and there is one part where you get really drunk and you wander around like an idiot. You have to find your drunk friend in the hotel, however if you walk into a room there are people having sex, however it is not bad and is with cloths on. No matter was path you choose (Violent or not as violent) you will always come across violence. If you are 13 and younger you should not play it but if you are a mature 13 year old you are fine.
I think this game is amazing! Me and my kids love it, but there is violence, no sex and a really positive message! You can fight and kill people but the death is not that bad. Don't say no to your kids yet, let them get it.
This game is the best! if your child can handle f bombs and some violence they can get this game but you can beat people and and rob them otherwise this game is good.
I have 9 year old son and he loves this game there is nothing that is extremely bad about this game and it is very good game. I would let any kid have this game.
Red dead redemtion 2 is hardly violent with very little blood and as for swearing a ten year old should probably know the words in here and they can be switched of in settings and the drinking is that really a problem
Red Dead Redemption 2 is an accurate depiction of what life was like in Western America in 1899. As someone who’s played through about two hours, I can tell you that it’s violent, with some sexual themes and drugs. So far, Arthur Morgan has prevented at least one rape, and there have been multiple violent shoot outs. But, despite its mature themes, Red Dead Redemption 2 presents an amazingly complex plot. Arthur Morgan faces many moral dilemmas, such as having to decide whether or not to spares band of thieves and murders. From my point of view, most mature thirteen and fourteen year olds will be able to recognize and deal with most mature themes in the game, but parents should be a little bit cautious letting kids 15 or under play.
KKK, Violence towards women , slavery and not subjects for children
my kid got this game. i was skeptical at first but after watching him play the story mode the whole day, i realized it was not bad. the review says there is a lot of sexual stuff. there really isn’t. it sends great messages. there is some violence, but not too much. there is some swearing but any middle schooler can handle it. they probably hear it every day at school.
I think if your kid knows right from wrong, this game wont cause any problems. Terrific graphics, and an amazing story. Even a little bit educational!
This game is awesome u can ride horses and u can go in on an adventure with ur friends and do some cool activities that are fun
I mean this game is the greatest. Probably the greatest out of all the Rockstar games. I played all GTA games and all the Red Dead Redemption games but this one takes the cake. There are very few sex scenes in it and you barely see anything. There might be genetailia but mostly on a horse. They're alot of bad language but it's a Rockstar game, come on and most kids has probably heard em from school. There's also alot of drinking and alchoal included but your kids should know about that I mean itsithe 21st century. There's also blood and gore in this game too but what do you expect in a game where there's guns and it's Western. There's also alot of stuff that your child can learn like to shoot a gun, how to rise a horse and take care of it, or how vicious wild animals are. It's a great game and your kid might learn how to skin an animal or learn how to fish because you can hunt and fish on here too. He or she can also learn how to gain trust in family/friends. This game also has a great story and even better graphics. I even let my 10 year old cousin platit and before the game came out he knew all about that stuff. And he knew how to hunt and fish. Anyways I give this game five stars because it brought me so much joy playing this game and for all the hard work Rockstar put into it. This is Automatic signing off
