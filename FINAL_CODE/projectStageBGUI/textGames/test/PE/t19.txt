Very good game, but has a lot of violence
Great game for teens
This game is really fun and way better than Fortnite.It can be a bit violent but nothing to extreme. I think this game is ok for kids that are at least 9 if they can Handle a bit of violence
As a gamer myself. I often like to play the same video games my 17 year old son plays. Apex is one of these games we both play it and I personally find the game addicting. Characters are super unique and diverse and the gameplay is astonishing. However, I do not recommend this game for anyone under the age of 16. Here’s why... 1. Loba is NOT for kids. So there are these characters in Apex called “legends” these legends are selected by the player and each has their own personality, skills, and play style. However their is a legend named “Loba” who was recently added to the game. She takes on the role of being a seductive [email protected]$!e. She has a handful of voice lines that are sexually explicit and are so frank a 10 year old could understand them. I want to keep this family friendly, but an example of one of her lines is “What I really want is down there.” They only get worse than that. Plus, her animations (you will see often) are of her showing off her “behind.” But you probably are thinking “I will just not let my son or daughter play her.” Well... I wish that were true, but she is a very popular character and will probably be on your team every other match. (Parents I advise you look up her animations and dirty Dialogue on YouTube so you can get a preview). 2. The community can be VERY toxic Just like every other competitive online game, there are troubled ”players.” I personally do not talk to other players because it would look weird for a 40 yr old man online to be talking to a maybe 16 yr old kid (I want to enjoy the game too, not come off as a creep). However, I often witness cyber bullying in this game. I try my best to get the bully punished. Most players in this game are between the ages of 15-26. If your child is below this age zone, I would not recommend they play the game for cyberbullying and online harassment purposes. The last thing you want is some 20 year old looser telling your child how ”bad they are” at the game. (it's a stupid reason but a very common one). 3. Trollers might expose your kids to UNWANTED content. As embarrassed as a I am disgusted, the trolls of the community have ruined this game for all ages under 18 years old. What do I mean by this? Some very hard working Losers who are living in their moms basement were able to modify the game files so there characters will be completely nude. You might say, ” Well isnt their nothing underneath a virtual characters clothes.” This part is where I become disgusted. They have made female characters like Loba have very graphic and extremely detailed ”ta-tas” and other women parts. Why do these losers waste their time turning this fun game into a creeps pornographic dream. I personally do not know but wish these players would get arrested as what they're doing is illegal. It's sad but they see very common to come across. 4. On the BRIGHT SIDE. I know this sounds like a very negative review, but I'll finish it off by pointing out some positives. First off, the violence in this game is overrated, when you “kill” someone, they don’t die they literally fall on their knees without a scratch and just disappear. This isn’t like Call of Duty where they get their limbs blown off or get blood everywhere. Also, this game doesn’t require a dime from your pocket. Although the option is always there to buy cosmetics for the game. This game is completely skill based their is no “pay to win” stuff. Thank you for reading my review. I hope this gave you a better understanding of the game. However, I really wish they would just remove Loba from the game and get rid of these online trolls and bullies. However, you will find this crowd in just about every other online game unfortunately.
It is my favorite game. When you hit head shots it sprays blood a bit but other than that the violence is minimal. A bunch of the characters are LGBTQ or just not your normal white male characters. It is a great game!
My son is 3 years old, and love this game. His favorite character is that cutie robot, pathfinder, who is inspiring my son to be an engineer when he grows up, so he too can build a robot to help him grow. This game also teaches teamwork, skillfulness, and give kids a whole new set of vocabulary words. It will inspire a new generation of soldiers and protectors of the planet, because we all know one day aliens will come for us all. La'Quchiuau Loves You!
I think all of your 14 year old kids should play this amazing game it's perfect for kids named riley
This game has almost nothing bad in it. There’s no language, all the violence is futuristic and minimal, plus there is no blood. the game is still very fun but it takes some skill of organization and I found the best place to play the game is in PC (sorry console gamers).
Very good game for kids who are in their college years, here are the reasons for why I think this should be the rating: Blood, violent scenes, mild gambling and online features.
I was at first hesitant at letting my 10 year old playing but I have realized that the game is not at all realistic a little bit of blood and no gore the game is not addictive unlike fortnite a much bitter less addictive game than fortnite
I’m fortnite, you can do hundreds of emotes to taunt other players. Also, Fortnite is copying everything from this game. Apex is a great game for kids 6+ if they are mature.
Great for teamwork. Definitely wouldn’t let anyone under age 10 play or watch, but a mature 10 year old could easily play this.
brilliant
This game has a lot of teamwork and helping other people
I’m guessing that there are some reviews on here where people are joking ? 3/5/7 year olds playing a game that’s been rated a 16 ? Screenagers really helps with looking at the psychological and brain development issues that arise from gaming.
The reason why I played this game so far similar to other Battle Royale games. This game contains mild blood, mild language and moderate violence, Players can interact their squads in gameplay and this game may experience online play. Using voice chat can swear other players including addiction to games. The profanity word H*ll and D**n can be heard in the dialogue with some characters of the game.
Most of the players are like 14+ and it fine but most 14 year olds are not that mature so 15 is good. (16+ recommended). There’s blood and looks realistic. But what really concerned me was the voice chat. There is a whole lot of toxic teens Swearing. And the voice chat is not that easy to disable. TIP: So if your kid plays it, be close to them and when they start a match don’t make them have headphones on or mute the volume until in the plane. Click (I) on pc or whatever on button to open inventory on the controller, on the top of there will be Three tabs; Inventory, squads, legend. Click squads and at the bottom of each player there will be a speaker click it to mute. But I still do not recommend kids under 12 to play
This game is so fun for my 7 year old son to play. He loves it and plays it daily. I only let him have 3 hours of screentime a day, and he spends all of it on Apex. There is a tiny bit of violence in this game, but it 100% promotes teamwork. I love this game and would let any elementary school student play it.
Apex legends is a great game, but it does have a lot of violence. If you are a a parent and you are okay with your kid playing a first person shooter that has blood and guns, well let your kid play it. It all depends on the parent, but for parents who have never seen the game and your child is begging you to let him/her to play it, I'm going to tell you about the game. First of all, Apex legends is a free to play shooter game on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 1, and PlayStation 4. Apex legends include lots of guns, first person shooting, and some blood. The blood in apex legends is very mild and there is no gore. There is a lot of teamwork and communication involved to win the game. There are a lot of in-game purchases, so if you let your child buy stuff on games, that is all your choice.
This is a great game that heavily focuses on team work and working together. I have a 12 year old that I let play and so far I can’t object. The only thing that made me a little skeptic at first was that there was blood but as I played it I barely noticed it. Overall a great game
WORST GAME EVER
it is afine name
Apex legends is from observation, an excellent video game and is for the most part, harmless.my 10 year old child loves it!
Suitable for 12 up
Never install this game ever again, terrible should never have been made delete this game
I think that this game is a very active and thrilling game. Whilst it is indeed a 16+ rating game, I think that other than moderate violence, it should be appropriate for ages 7 and above. However it does mainly depend on the personality and maturity of your child, so don't just take my word for it.
I was a little hesistant about letting my son (age 13 play this at first), although I played a few games myself and realised that the violence is unrealistic and there are no graphic scenes. Overall it is a great game, although I would say under 10 should not be allowed. 16 is too high a rating for this game. I also think that it encourages team spirit.
from a gaming parent
"GAO" is a very well defined "space survival" with a good mix of fun and realism although the game is mostly about surviving a never ending barrage of aliens (many are creepy looking spider/bug things) its not as graphic as space horror games like dead space, and most of the gore is infact alien secretions used to show them "infesting" your ship as far as letting children play: if your child has seen the film starship troopers played 5 nights at Freddies or finds insects and aliens fascinating (like mine) they'll be fine playing this game if you worry about them playing a game, participate in it (so that you can see and judge for yourself) though as always a parent should use their own gut instincts when buying games for children
Occasionally difficult but deliciously written RPG
Violence: Mild ship vs. other ship/bug/monster combat. When killed bugs emit a tiny blood splatter effect that quickly disappears. Most violence takes place within text descriptions, which can occasionally be graphic or disturbing-however nothing is ever shown. Gameplay and stories contain elements of Cosmic Horror, but not nearly as much as the previous game, Sunless Skies. | Sex: No visible sex or nudity. Occasional light allusions to sexual activity within the text. | Language: All language is censored within the game. | Drugs: Occasional references within the text to alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as smuggling of fictitious drugs (such as hallucinogenic honey). A handful of character portraits depict still images of lit cigarettes.
BEST GAME SERIES EVER!
This game is AMAZING! The story will pull your heartstrings, the combat is easy, and more! The only problem I had with CSM's review is that they said that it had a load of consumerism. But it's only that Disney worked with Square Enix (The company behind Final Fantasy), and that would mean that Disney characters will meet and become friends with Final Fantasy characters! And they're ALL a part of the story! I love this VG (Video Game) Series, and I think It's the BEST GAME SERIES EVER!
This is part of the BfA expansion, and is not recommended
First off, you should be aware that World of Warcraft: Tides of Vengeance is a PATCH and not an EXPANSION of the game. The current expansion is Battle for Azeroth (BfA), and you must buy BfA and pay a monthly subscription. BfA is the worst expansion in the 15 year history of WoW. I have played the game since 2007. As a parent, I would not let a child that is in school, play this game. Not because it has bad content, but rather the sheer volume of time required. WoW has destroyed many young careers due to endless grinds that eat up a lot of precious time. In my opinion, this game is for adults that can manage their time. Not for children, even though they could easily play it. There are better games out there for kids, in my opinion.
A great re-imagining of the original with the stunning graphics of Capcom's RE Engine being put to brilliantly grotesque use. It ain't one for the squeamish.
Dang, there is a lot of blood!
17+
Great Remake of a classic Survival Horror Game
Game takes a more violent approach compared to the original
An incredible horror experience for adults only
not that bad
Scary and disturbing game
Resident Evil 2 by far the best game remake of my knowledge.
Just like portal 2 for mature high schoolers
Best resident evil so far ?? i wish they made the the other series like this one
Resident Evil 2 is the 2019 remake of the classic PS1 horror game from the late 90's. You follow two survivors, rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, sister of the original game's Chris Redfield as they search the amazingly claustrophobic Racoon City to discover the truth as to why the local populace have turned into the flesh-devouring undead and other more dangerous monsters. Firstly, by survival-horror game standards especially, the gameplay is outstanding. The inventory system is designed in a way where it doesn't feel unfairly restricted, but what happens to you will be your fault if you don't manage your inventory (weapons, ammunition, healing items, key items, crafting items etc.) carefully. The A.I. of the zombies is quite possibly the best zombie A.I. to date, while slow and shambling akin to more classic, George A. Romero-esque zombies, they are still very much a threat and can put you down as quicker as the more threatening monsters if you are not protecting your very limited health carefully. Lickers are fairly easy to deal with under beginning circumstances, just walk past them slowly and they will not acknowledge your presence, but sometimes being attacked by one is unavoidable is other enemy types are present and trying to attack you. When Mr. X (the Tryant bio-weapon) shows up the tension rises exponentially as he chases you through the hallways of the police station while you try and complete other objectives. Engaging him is futile unless you have no other option as the best you'll do is slow him down, though he is less of an issue in Claire's scenarios as he is not present for anywhere as much time as he is in Leon's. I mentioned the RE Engine before as being stunning and it is. The environments and particularly the character models are rendered with unbelievable detail and with that detail comes my next point; the gore. This the most detailed gore systen I've ever seen bar the Mortal Kombat franchise, not only can limbs be dismembered or blown up, but there are different levels of injury (clothes, skin, muscle and finally bone) which can lead to all manner of grusome looking wounds. The dismemberment looks extremely real as arms can hang off a zombie for a second or two before the rest of the flesh tears and the limb falls to the ground. Hit one in the right place around the stomach and it will split in half with it's guts and entrails flailing behind it as the it will then proceed to crawl towards you. Making the head explode is the only way to truly put one down as these zombies are the definition of bullet sponges, you can knock them down, even shoot them in the head, but unless that is completely destroyed, it's getting back up. Not much in the ways of language, a few f--ks and s--ts here and there, but it's not massively strong.
I have a 10 year old son who I caught playing silent hill, apparently his friend gave it to him! I was very mad, so I made a deal with him that if he broke his silent hill disc, I would let him play resident evil(before that deal I would NEVER let him play any horror games)! Ever since he has been playing it a lot, I hear him screaming, and he has developed a fear of the dark since playing the game, and never goes anywhere alone anymore. There is a LOT of blood in the game, but if your 10 year old is a man like my 10 year old, it is OK! There is also a ton of cus words in the game. I think that this game is a good role model because it will teach my 10 year old how to survive, because the point of this game is survival.
Language: Some Strong Sex: Mild Violence: Strong, Blood and Gore Other: Strong Horror
Great game, but only for strong stomached people. Wow, there's a lot of blood in this game. You can shoot off specific limbs/body parts with fairly detailed gore and organs. If violence was on a scale, it'd be a 9/10. There isn't much sex in the game, just one kiss and some sexually suggestive posters (women in bikinis), and an OPTIONAL note about a certain character saying he "nearly came" when he did a taxidermy on a tiger, creepy! There's lots of swearing in this game, there are multiple uses of most swear words you can think of. I chose "Positive Role Models" because Leon and Claire are, at least in my opinion, good role models. Both do their best to protect the people they love and are very selfless. Overall, this is a really good game and if you are a fan of the OG Re2, or a survival horror fan in general, this is a must play!
Even though the game was rated 15+ at first, it took a more realistic look and added more gore to the remake, Plus they've included profanity making it more adult themed. The characters on the other hand display a good message.
While this game contains literally no nudity (even partial), the game features a constant barrage of creepy imagery/sound, profanity and what is easily the most unpleasantly realistic gore I have ever seen. Now, having said that, it is a horror game exclusively for adults with some of the most heart-pounding sequences in gaming history. The zombies are scary enough, but throw in Lickers and the almost-Singing G-spawns, and you've got yourself an all-out nightmare. And that's before you throw Mr X into the mix, whom is absolutely terrifying because he plays with human survival instinct PERFECTLY; he's massive, almost unstoppable, and you can hear him stomp around looking for you, like a cross between a predator and The Terminator. Now, the original RE2 told a more wholesome version of the story here, and successfully fused horror with a somber, sad tone that this game doesn't even attempt, but on its own merits, this is genuinely as good as it gets. Just note that the violence is literally as high as it can go as it's brutal and disturbingly lifelike - I just don't mark it as, for adults, this only makes the overall package more compelling.
a bit gory at times, but not that bad. 13+ for sure
This is a very solid remake of a very scary game. With updated graphics, this game has extremely dark and disturbing imagery. NOT FOR KIDS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.
The Resident Evil 2 remake is surprisingly good in my opinion. Most remakes don't compare to the original. But this took the game and brought it beyond compare. The new tactics with the introductions of old characters. (Mr. X for example.) Really pulls this game together.
This is a suitable game for teens and is very enjoyable for high schoolers
It’s a little violent but it give realistic to the game
