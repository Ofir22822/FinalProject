Great mechanics and gameplay but the most disturbing stuff isn't the gore.
dont play during halloween
It’s great
Great game!
Really good game, for a specific age range.
It's a normal call of duty with a slightly darker campaign

Despite its flaws, I absolutely love this game
Awesome story line ( campaign)
Please don't
Campaign review: Big upgrade in terms of narrative and cutscenes
A pretty accurate review.
Very cool, VERY violent
Good canpagin
It's fine if your kid knows about war and knows not to say curses.
Review is garbage
Review the age rating
So underrated
Very disturbing imagery
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a solid CoD, the best in many years. Typically CoD is gory, disturbing and brutally portrays war in an unforgiving way. This CoD is the most disturbing and makes No Russian from mw2 look like child's play compared to this. People burn alive, people are tortured and hung. You can kill civilians in front of their kids and there's a scene where you torture a guy and use his family as leverage. There are several scenes of dead children and executions via hanging or shooting. In terms of gore it's like every other recent CoD. Guns cause blood to realistically splatter on walls and floors, explosives and snipers can dismember people and even decapitate them. You can perform Mortal Kombat esque finishing moves where you slit enemies throats, snap necks and other ways of killing enemies. These clearly glamorise violence but they're optional, as is the gore. Dismemberment can be disabled. The game doesn't glamorise violence much however. It makes you feel bad for killing people in the campaign and portrays war as realistic as possible. It's a gritty, immersive game and is very fun overall. The multiplayer is a good mp. Lots of new innovative ideas and returing ones like vehicles are present and makes the game more realistic and gives these battles scale. Graphically it's gorgeous and is the best looking CoD yet. The guns feel and sound very authentic and realistic as does everything else. The killstreaks are the best yet. You can fly around in a helicopter, control a missile in first person and man a heavy turret and that's only a few. The customisation options are plentiful and it's easy to spend hours tuning your classes. Some maps feel a bit lacking but most are good. Spec ops is ok, not amazing but ok. Warzone is a great ideas and plays amazingly. It's free as well so if you're not sure about this game then try that first and decide for yourself. The campaign is amazing but isn't very long. Overall Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a good entry and has revitalised the franchise. This game is suitable for all 14+ or people with the maturity of a 14 year old.
i kinda like this game but if your in america or austraila people swear alot i have been called a c*nt sometimes i watched a youtube video on the new halloween update and nearly sh*t myself
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is my favorite installment in the Call of Duty franchise. It portrays deep realism and also some of the harshest aspects of modern combat. Marines have said that this is the most realistic video game ever. This game has a very compelling campaign that has a lot of heroism that demonstrates the bravery of our veterans. I would say if you’re over 13, you can thoroughly enjoy this game. Although it’s much worse in real life, this game does have some rough language and of course some blood, as it is realistic to real life. I’d also rate it this high because it really plays with your heart, you have to make very tough choices in combat. You have to choose who’s life to spare and who’s to take. In one mission, you find a house we’re half are hostages and half are terrorists. The hostages and terrorists are very difficult to tell between. You must choose when to shoot and when to hold your fire. It does make you feel bad when you accidentally take out an innocent. Overall, this is a great game but you have to be wise in what you put in your mind at what age, I’m a Christian and this game didn’t hurt my relationship with God, I hope you enjoyed this review and that it helps you make your decision.
This game is great for kids like me who just want to have fun with their friends. altho this game has a few aspects it is a great game to buy your kid. (sorry for my spelling) it does have blood and gore but can be eaisly turned off in the settings. please get this game for your kid if they want it.
I play this game often, and I think it is amazing. It depicts the world of what our modern-day soldiers have to go through. However, it has alot, and I mean, alot, of violence. It isn't suitable for kids under 12, due to the graphic nature of both the campaign and multiplayer.
Call of duty modern warfare is a very standard call of duty game with normal amounts of violence, very softcore gore and blood, and a decent amount of cussing. Now the thing about this game is the campaign. In the campaign you deal with things such as proxy wars, terrorism, and chemical warfare. There are a lot of mature levels in it such as one where a car bomb goes off in Piccadilly square, and one where you have to clear out a house containing innocent people. It's a very well done campaign but just might be a bit to mature for younger children. Other than that it's a pretty great game, the multiplayer itself is fine for most ages and its just really fun. As always it depends on the child and how mature he or she is.
anyone can play this game as long as they're mature enough. your kid will hear much much worse language in school. teens and tweens are generally extremely nasty and dirty minded. as for the violence part, who cares. if ur son is a retard who talks about killing people with machine guns and stuff like that in public then dont allow him to play. other than that this game is BS! the plot is so stupid. idk why theyre showing the russians as pure evil when the americans werent any better. stupid plot about evil russians with weapons of mass destruction. it messes up the image of captain john price.
Modern Warfare is my favorite subseries in the Call of Duty Franchise. I like the more serious and (relatively) realistic approach to the gameplay. I was super excited when this was announced, and honestly. I am not disappointed with the result. In terms of presentation, the game is amazing. Gunplay is top-notch and feels excellent, the sound design is impactful, and the customization is vast. Graphics and animation are extremely detailed. The campaign is great, with a tighter story, grittier tone, and smaller scale action. But it's also why I think this game is recommended for 14+. The Multiplayer is standard content for a FPS (blood spurts, possibly toxic players, privacy concerns, etc), but the campaign has some very disturbing moments and explores mature themes not seen in most single-player shooters. There are a lot of things that bother me, maps aren't very good, weapons often don't load in at the gunsmith, the campaign is a bit too short, and it has microtransactions in a full-price game. Overall, this is one of the best shooters on current gen consoles (as of 2020).
I’m going to focus this review on the campaign because I know that lots of people are going to do a multiplayer review. It is a bit griddy and I definitely would NOT recommend it to any one who is not mature or old enough to Handel it but is a awesome story line and there are lots of great role models.players track down stollen gas and there are lots of good plot twists,and I grew up on the first cod games so that’s saying lot.And what commen sense said about shooting civilians is sometimes true.but it’s almost never on purpose.if you play FPS a lot you have to have fast Game reflexes and your brain thinks it’s just another ai or player. That’s going to end my review. Remember I would Not I repeat Not let anyone who is not mature enough to play this
Please don't let your kids play this game! This is too much violence. If they grow up playing this, it will affect their behavior! :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a reboot to the original Modern Warfare series. With new gameplay feel and look, this reboot aims towards a more cinematic feel. The story is pretty good and the characters are very much likeable. The narrative could've been a little better as well as the dialogue. Missions have more variety this time around. Some controversial and some genuinely refreshing for the series. Violence is pretty intense. Cutscenes or key story moments as well as gameplay can contain some horrifically violent moments. Not gonna go too deep on it, but one scene shows a suicide bomber taking out blowing up a section of London. Others contain shooting civilians that are suspicious and can't be trusted. Language is strong and frequent. Use of "arse" "f#!k", "f#!king", "$h!t" and "b#!ch" are heard in dialogue.
This game truly isn't too bad. You can disable gore and swearing, and only play the multiplayer. The campaign is where the violence really happens but most kids want this game to play with their friends in multiplayer. Please take this into consideration!
If you have a child who can handle some gore, and violence, then maybe let them play it. You can always turn off gore if your on PC, and the campaign doesn't need to be played for anything. It also has a mature content warning for good reason.
Tbh i think it is just fine for 12 year olds and up because you can turn of violence and gore etc..
Im not the biggest fan cod but the campagin really good
Okay, so first off. This is a perfectly fine game, with a little excessive swearing and such. The violence is fairly low, the worst being people strapped in bomb vests (civilian). The game helps children understand war, and the role models are great. In most of the game, you are a member of task force 141 trying to save civilians from "Al-Qatala" , a terrorist militia. You'll see many heroic actions preformed which provides great role models. Okay, now for the worst part. The consumerism is high, with a single operator and a few guns you'll most likely never use bumping up to 20 dollars. The battle pass is fairly cheap, and I recommend it. Although if you want an Allegiance (Russian) skin, you'll have to pay up quite a bit. Surprise purchases are very easy without a parent's permission warning or anything. Anyways, that's my opinion. Just make sure your kid understands war, and won't swear.
Modern Warfare very accurately depicts what war is really like and I feel like children should know what the real world is like.
This game is fine for most ages. multiplayer 6+ but the campaign is at least 11+ check the options you can turn off dismemberment and game chat. It is an amazing game definitely worth the price!
I think that I may be gory but I do not think that it should be rated 18+ because there isn’t that much gore
Ok so I think most of the game is pretty disturbing like the mission where your a child and you see your dead mother in a cut scene or where your tortured it’s really disturbing to me anyway it was great story just I felt uncomfortable during most of it just because of how loud and I guess disturbing it all was you have to hide under a bed from soldiers and stab them that was super stressful for me and it made me super uncomfortable otherwise really great game I would check it out if you had the opportunity
Campaign good for 13+. 12+ really should stick to multiplayer.
graet game!!!!!!!
Too much violence
Multiplayer and warzone are amazing for teens
Good
Great Game for tweens and teens if you stay away from the Campaign
read
Multiplayer is 12+ but campaign is 16+
MY FAVOURITE GAME!!!
Don’t listen to the Karen’s!
Not bad but...
From an honest person that want the best for your kids
It’s a good game
Great game!
COD MDWE is sooooooooooooooooooooo goood
Fine just a little to mature for kids...
My favorite video game series
Great but the campaign was to short
Great for a shooter
The campaign does carry some heavy themes that could scare younger players. Some of these things are shootings in city streets, a torture scene, and hangings. 13+ could take this type of things but younger players can not. If you yave a 12 year old who wants to play the game try to steer them toward the online multiplayer.
It really teach alot about modern ware. I now want to enlist when i becume old enof. I cant wait to show my sergeatnt my noscoping skills. I also just got into FaZe becaus i am super good at game.
Too much violence and blood. Good for children at least 15.
Im 13 and I play with so may of my friends and i can say nothing but praise for this game. the story mode has some things that you might not want you kids to see but if they are mature I think they can handle it.
It’s not bad you can turn off blood and language there’s one scene where you can interrogate a women and a kid but you can skip it. It also has great role models for kids who wanna be in the military to see the great men and women serving our country.
This game is an extremely rewarding and enjoyable online experience. The multiplayer is always fun thanks to a variety of operators, weapons and challenges to work towards. The multiplayer aspects of this game are not overly graphic at all. When shot blood spurts and stains surfaces but is not very noticeable. The multiplayer is all action with very few slow moments depending on your play style. However the Campaign is a completely different story. Infinity Wards objective is to make a realistic and brutal story. The missions though they have the same gunplay are much more graphic and realistic with various gore effects. Various missions throughout such as "Clean House" and Farahs flashback missions are graphic and upsetting. All in all the multiplayer I would rate 13+ but the campaign 15+
veary fun and veary entertaning and it has a 2 player mod
This game's campaign features very gory and disturbing imagery, from shooting screaming, helpless people in agony, to torturing your enemies for information. The campaign for that reason receives a 16+ from me. HOWEVER the multiplayer is fit for anyone aged 12 and up in my opinion. There is swearing ("f*ck", "sh*t") but that can be turned off by turning dialogue off and there can be dismemberment with some weapons, but that can be turned too, meaning players can only see a small cloud of blood. Multiplayer is only 12+ with these off. Hope this helped :)
This game is incredible but there are also lots of bloody moments like finishing moves. there is swearing but mostly in the campaign. Sometimes there are toxic players you know how it is but honestly it should not be 18+. I started when I was 12 but I never got addicted. It's fun but you need to play multiple game modes to get the best experience
First the reviews on this game are Karen’s that don’t care what real reviewers say in the campaign yes pretty violent But the multiplayer is fine you can barley see the blood and it won’t “Make your kids terroists!” They are exatterateing so if your kid really wants the game just give it. And if someone swears you can all ways mute them plus most parents writing the reviews haven’t played The game.
I raged alot many times when i played Warzone, but i just want to get better at this game better than me rage quitting on my own XBOX One.
Well, common sense lied in some parts. The video all happens but you can turn off anything that can actually scar your kid or make them act violent. I’ve played it so I should know.
I think it should be 11 plus there is blood, guns and a little bit torture and healing injections and it’s basically based on what army personnel go throughout and my dad lets me play it. You can go into the setting and turn off blood
Ok, I know that it says there is sex and really, I've seen no kissing, no in the bed stuff and none of that. It would be fine but pretty violent. That was for campaign, the story part. I recommend doing that so your child doesn't have to spend money on extra characters. It gives you some free. The story has a lot of swearing, but no racial slurs of any kind. Next, the multiplayer mode. You can talk with random people, but you can mute yourself and mute everyone else. If you are in a PS4 or Xbox party, it will usually.only let you talk to party members or friends in the party. Also, forgot 1 thing. In story mode, there is one character that smokes cigars and his name is Captain Price. On to Warzone, the battle royale map in Verdansk, russia . This I'snt as bad as the other modes, as you can do a setting where you don't put random people in your team. You cannot talk with anyone but your team. That's about it
This is a fun game with a fun online! However this game has a campaign with Profanity, Gore (Can be filterd), and mature topics... This game has lots of filters you can turn off characters dialogue leaving only subtitles, Mute online players, and turn off the gore. I say for teens mainly due to its heavy theme of the campaign but most things can be filtered.
My favorite video game series. I think its not that bad for little kids to play
I would’ve given this game a 5 star review if it weren’t for the fact it has and extremely short campaign as I finished it after about 5 hours. This game main problems are the violence and swearing. The swearing is pretty frequent. Like all call of duty games The violence is pretty bloody and frequent.
Being a big fan of story based games I have to say it was pretty good. Violence: almost all of the violence in the game is shooting. Personally I can handle this even with the blood and gore. You can turn off blood in settings but keep in mind it can be turned back on anytime. There is also melee combat but it isn’t very exaggerated or violent with only a simple animation and a tiny bit of blood. Swears: there is frequent swearing throughout the campaign but I don’t recall any in online multiplayer. These include mostly f-bombs and some s##ts. It’s nothing worse than what I hear at school. Campaign: the campaign/story was the selling point for me, I did play some multiplayer but found the story much more intriguing. It was insanely well done for a shooter and there were some good messages of teamwork and doing the right thing. In conclusion, anyone 13 or older should be able to play this game without any problems and I would rate multiplayer a 4/5 and the campaign a solid 5/5.
The review that Common sense media gives it is based of the story made which is much darker so my review is split 18+ for the campaign and 13+ for the pvp aspect
