Well-Crafted RPG for older teens (gore, language, and a drug reference sort of)
A good rpg
should have listened to ESRB
A Chip off the Old Block
WoW!!! My favorite Xbox game
The Outer Worlds!
Phenomenal Game
Great
Must play
I cannot stress how awesome this game is. It is very engaging with incredible gameplay and a layered narrative. However, it does contain some gore, violence, and language. The gore is not too terrible unless the player uses tactical time dilation, which slows time and increases the blood and gore showed during a kill while it is active. Playing without it will limit gore to post-battle carnage, which can also be avoided if the player just doesn't loot the bodies, and the will actually make the game faster paced and more action oriented. The language is not over the top, but you will hear the f word sparsely and read cursing in messages found on various computer consoles found in the world. Though the game doesn't have any real sexual content, there is a character who is interested in dating another character with the same gender, and at one point the ship's computer asks for some "privacy" with the cleaning robot on the ship. There is also a part on a side mission where you inhale a bunch of drugs or something and talk to a guy's dead mother or something, but I wasn't paying attention and the whole section is easy to skip. Overall, the good vastly outweighs the bad, so I would recommend waiting until you are/your kid is, 15 &amp; 1/2 or 16 before playing.
Now I think it is ok for kids 11 If they can handle it, because it can get really violent at times. You can be shooting humans on Terra-2 or Stabbing aliens on Monarch. There is a range of weapons to use. TO wrap this up I think if your kid can handle violence and swearing it is ok.
not easy to play and very bloody
This RPG game is a masterpiece! The game play is extensive and intriguing, the graphics and scenery are beautiful, and it's overall very creative. It teaches good morals and really tests your inner conscience. Who will you help? The rebels that are sick of their lives or the corporations. Also, the game was created by some of the same people that created the Fallout series so if you love those games, you are guaranteed to like The Outer Worlds. The only thing I think parents should be concerned about is the fact that they use the F-Word about once every 30 minutes.
I absolutely LOVE this game. There's a lot of things that make this game so great. First of all, there are intense battles, with both humans and animals. Plus, the scenery is beautiful! When you talk to in-game characters, it seems super realistic. The characters have a very sarcastic sense of humor, which will have me cracking up at the most random satire. I know parents are usually paranoid about their kids playing M rated games, but if you're fine with strong language, blood, gore, and a bit of other M rated traits (ex: there's a seemingly friendly family in one part, but you find out that they are cannibals and they try to kill and devour you.) In the game, characters frequently say b***h, f**k, s**t, a**hole, a**, etc. The blood and gore in the game isn't that major. It's not very realistic. You'll often see blood splattered on the ground, and it is usually pink-ish. You will see mangled bodies, both of humans and animals. The blood is more realistic when it is on a body, but if there are splatters it's not realistic. The Outer Worlds is a great first M-rated game. At first, my dad sat down with me and watched me play it. After watching me play for 2 days, he approved of the game and let me play it unsupervised. As for guns, they're mostly sci-fi, and it is really nothing you should hide your kids from. In battles, there's blood splatter, but the game always has this fun, sarcastic, cartoony feeling. It can be a bit dark sometimes,(cannibalism, murder, etc.) Overall it is a great game. It is fun, entertaining, fascinating, beautiful, funny, sarcastic, and about everything in between. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
So far, I have loved this game on Xbox One X. Quests are really good and entertaining. In fact I loved it. So Much that for February next year I pre ordered it on Nintendo Switch! A couple of tiny problems. 1. I have to say violence is the main issue with this games brutal, gory, bloody so if your kid is really sensitive to violence then this is a no go. 2. Swearing is heard very frequently meaning very often the game drops f**k , sh*t, and b***ch. Over wise if your child can handle this kind of stuff in The Outer Worlds the this is a must have for any gamer.
U don't care what anyone says, this is the best game I have ever played. The graphics are stunning, and I don't know what common sense media is saying because there are good role models. You can literally just become the hero of the game, rescuing civilians from dangerous people/monsters. The blood might be a little more than expected, but if your kids are mature about it than it should be fine.
It’s wonderful but too much swearing
Pretty good game overall
Awesome game, 9+
Scary-ish Mystery
Karena saya masih kelas 4c
OMG stop giving this scary ratings
This game is great and fun to play with friends. It's not very scary, even though it's rated as "horror". The scariest part would be the neighbor, who you have to avoid in order to beat the game. You also have to find a set of keys. The game is very cartoony and not graphic. When the neighbor catches the kids, they fade away into a pile of missing posters, but as I said it's cartoony and not going to scar your kid for life. Think of it as when Thanos snaps the avengers into dust, to put it that way. Online chat is there, but you can mute people.
It’s a who done it murder mystery and in this wacky hello neighbor spin off you use teamwork and trust to survive the neighbor’s wrath!
I think it a great game its kinda scary but play it with a friend and your fine If your sensitive to minor jumpscares then it not the best game for you.
THE ADULT IS WRONG(the one who posted the 13+) the neighbour is not creepy whatsoever otherwise it would be a pegi 12. But it is not it is a PEGI 7. This is a fun game to play. I said 7 and up for people who don't mind scary things but even if you get creeped out by a lot of things this would be a solid 9 or 10 yr. Most people ignore when kids give ratings BUT THIS IS TRUE. Thank you.
A good Game
Too much sex
I think this is a great game. It is really fun to play and has creative and funny characters and names. I do not think there is anything inappropriate but if there is anything I missed very few kids would see it or understand it.
Too many sexual references for small children, my 16 boys were all shocked by the graphic content in this game.
not the scariest
Sure, corpses and monsters, but if the person playing this game is not scared of those, it's perfectly fine! Cussing is frequent, but that only adds to the game's atmosphere!
It's Pretty Trash
It's OK
Literal Trash
My review
goooood
This game let's you be your own wrestler, slick!!!
The game overall is fun, but it is glitchy
Good but has some inappropriate stuff.
A few good and a lot of BAD
ty
My Opinion
If you think of buying this game please dont buy it It kinda sucks and is very hard to play
Some Violence but it will probably be ok for 7 and 8 year olds who like fighting games
Before you buy this game. Look up WWE 2k20 Angry Joe review. It states every reason why this game is trash.
Great game for kids. Blood is an option but its default is blood is off. Swearing is rarely heard in play or universe mode but some can be heard in career mode. If you like wrestling this game is great. Also kids who want to be a wrestler can make the superstar of their dreams in this game. Although making a move set for your characters is time consuming it pays off greatly when you go and fight someone. Universe mode is awesome because you can make your own shows and not worry about superstars you dont know ruining your match. Although in universe mode there is promos and you can sometimes choose swear words as an option. Make sure your kid knows what turning heel/face are because if you dont know what those mean you can mess up your universe really bad
fun fun very very fun it is fun to create things and the fighting is good some swearing and blood but you can turn blood off
Nice WWE!!!! One of the best!!!! I used to watch my cousins play it many times!!!!! Lovely game!!
I bought this game about 1 week after it came out, and I liked it, but I had to pay 14 dollars for "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt, And there is an option to take off wrestlers' clothes in the edit a wrestler option, the graphics look like something from a PS3 game, and there is too many glitches.
This game is good but it does have some stuff your kids should know. There is a little blood but that can be turned off. Story mode is just not appropriate. Such as someone being called "A**wipe" and other cuss words for story mode. It even involves you have a dead person's ashes being blown on you and you even swallow some of the ashes. And there is some more creepy stuff in story mode. Regular play is just fine. Do not go to community creations to download images, because they can include inappropriate stuff. Another thing to talk about is the clothing options.The game allows you to make female superstars fight in their underwear. There are not many great messages in the game. You are allowed to insult people in universe mode. If i were you, i would let kids play default mode at the top of the options mode, but not story mode.
Alright so typically I love these WWE games and think they are amazing, but not 2k20... This is an unfinished game that WWE should have released 2 weeks later than they did. So I pre-ordered the game before any info came out, then I start hearing negatives but they always talk about the bad. Well this time they were right and I wasted 129.99 on the Smackdown Edition of it. So once it loaded I realized the controls were different (which I don't really mind) epecially the reverse is now "Y" instead of "RT". Now another thing which is a downgrade in my opinion is the glitches and there are a lot of them, first there is a glith where a team would still be in the ring during a superstars entrance, a glitch in some cases where a superstar with long hair would have in go in the body disappearing, and many more of the glitches where a cpu would not move. Now this game is very disappointing and the only good I have for it is that there is a good selection in the character suite. Overall 2/5 for a very disappointing game (hopefully 2k21 is better).
The games graphics are better
It is kust like other wwe games.But a little harder to play.You see,They changed tge controls and that might be harder dor old players or possibly new players.The online community creation can expose you to other creations people have made which could be innaproprete.The online play you can play with real people and team up with real people which could. Be bad.Mild sex.Otherwise the graphics are terrible there was a downgrade.But otherwise its your opinion
The best
Great Game Just Doesn't Achieve What It's Predecessors Did
As good as the previous one
Good but disappointing
AWESOME!
Very good!
This game is fun and any parent should be ok with this shooter
New PVZ installment with good content
This is the third entry in the Plants vs. Zombies shooter titles. I'm not going to say this is Garden Warfare 3, as the graphics are different, some of the controls are different, and it just has a very "different" feel to it. On to the appropriate for kids part. Age ratings are evil, by the way. First of all, there are absolutely no role models in this game at all. That isn't a bad thing, either. It's just that the characters don't do anything except blast each other. The weapons in the game are not in any sense realistic, and says the same for the violence, which just shows how much damage you do, then characters disappear when deceased. This game is not addictive, but can cause great anger In players, as it takes a long time to kill people, and the sprinting feature allows people to annoyingly run away from you, allowing other people to steal your kill. The game also has an entire community of players who won't let anyone catch a break, including ability spammers, ballers, players who will jump off cliffs to stop you from getting them killed, suicide chompers, night cap mains, husk hoppers, and oak spammers. This game has a ridiculous amount of flaws, but there are so many elements and features to the game, the pros dominate the cons. One problem is you can't play the competitive side of the game unless you have PS Plus or Xbox Live Gold. If you don't have these, you will be restricted to the PvE side of things, and you shouldn't be rushing out to buy the game. Also note that you must have PS Network or Xbox Live, plus you need to have or create an EA account, and have a stable internet connection to even start the game. Plus, you can't get the game on Switch. I know. That concludes this review. I hope you found this helpful. Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville is out now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One.
A fun shooter that has fun modes for everyone. The free roam lobby may get confusing though. Also theres in game currency but it does make the player fell satisfied.
I got it a while ago, and whilst the game isn’t terrible, it is much worse than its predecessors. First up, the skins now don’t give you different weapons, which was a feature of GW2 I really enjoyed, although I guess the skins being just cosmetics does take away the pay to win element. Second, it’s really REALLY laggy. Third, it’s only online. There are no upsides today this. As a new player, it’s really hard to get better because the only ways to play are with other online players or shooting targets. So you have the option of too difficult or insanely boring. Fourth, the new characters. Why??? They are all really badly designed, far too powerful to be fair, or terrible. There are some good bits though. Some of the new maps are awesome, the graphics are strange but exciting, and the new skins look cool.
I love this game so much! Although it is not a good as garden warfare 2 it is still a very fun game and I recommend giving it to your child if they are a fan of pvz.
It is a great game that is very easy. I see no reason for youths 8 and higher could not play
I love this game being a player of the garden warfare games and pvz heroes. This game has an official rating of E10+ cause fantasy violence. and I understand that there is so much you can do in game whether its helping out a football playing zombie to escort a washing machine with puberty-esque insecurities or helping a sheriff pea plant keep zombies in jail, this game is a fun time. This game is always fun to play with my friends and siblings and is just a goofy game to have fun with. I mean come on, a super hero zombie punching a cybernetic orange that shoots literal orange juice to kill zombies, how can you say this is bad for kids. This game is great for anybody. I have a friend, who's parents would never let him play a shooter like Halo or COD (Call of Duty), but this is the kind of shooter he could play with me, and it teaches people team skills being a game where it is 100% team based with no free-for-all modes at all. I guess you could say its good for your brainz, get it? Plus, I have some personal recommendations for your kids based on age: if your kid is ages 6-7 allow use the free roam regions on easy mode, for ages 8-9 allow them to use the lobby to play against their friends and bots and the free roam on any difficulty to avoid teammates who are not very nice in online multiplayer, and for ages 10+ give them free control over what they do in game.
As someone who's played practically every Plants vs Zombies game, I'm happy to say that Plants vs Zombies: Battle For Neighborville is a fun and fresh game. If you've played the previous Garden Warfare games, then you know the basic idea of this one. It's a third person shooter that has the player fight the opposing team as a plant or zombie. You choose characters and play. The newest installment has some new mechanics such as sprinting, artwork, and characters. However, the single player "campaign mode" is disappointing as I still want a fully fledged out story instead of basic missions. It's fun and entertaining but not the best. Luckily this game has multiplayer, which is where it shines. Lots of similar gamemodes make a return, and since new ones arrive. Like always, it's a very unique and entertaining experience. The game is missing features that were critical in previous games, like character variations. Age Review: It's not the best the series has been but it's worth grabbing on sale. You play as a plant or zombie, and you fight. No "actual" guns but it's still a shooter. The game has zombies in it but they're not scary in any way. They are in fact humours. Little to no violence, no language, and no sex. Recommended for ages 5+
