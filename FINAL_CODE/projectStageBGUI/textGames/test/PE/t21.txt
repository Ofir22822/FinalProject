No bueno.
nightmare fuel
Very cool but could be scary for younglings!
The figure of ink is too much for kids
Why does this game get such a bad rap?!
Good game
A cool game
It may be scary for young ones, but theres really nothing mature in this game
Amazing game, perfect for 12 year old kids
Awesome game, buy for 10 year old or up
Parents are exaggerating the “horrible things” that happen in this game
Religious? Probably not for you...
best!
Why do people give this a horrible review!?
pretty noice
good game
Fun!
I’m a cool laid back mama but I do have a problem with this game it’s full of bad subliminals for kids. There’s literally a pentagram thing on the wall, the characters are possessed, they rip heads off, list goes on. And I’m sorry but my son said he was a demon the other day after playing this game and that isn’t cool with me. He’s 7 and was talking about lost souls and possession. That’s not ok..............
unfortunately, this game would be OK for kids 13 and up if it wasn't for Alice angle and the satanic ritual. There is a great deal of references about satanic stuff and Alice angle. however, Henry is brave and the rebellion is to in chapter 5.
I love Bendy as it is such a unique concept. Doesn't mean it has it moments. There are a few jumpscares, but aren't that scary. There is no sex or anything like that, but there is a few uses of hell: two in Chapter 2 and one in Chapter 4, as well as a few uses of damn: Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. The main thing is the violence and creepiness. The violence includes, an axe blow to the head, a decapitation, a sword through the heart and killing ink monsters as well as lots of death. Bendy himself is a demon-like creation and can spawn in Chapter 3 a lot, which could scare younger players. But overall, isn't that bad and should be played by kids 10 and up.
Do not let little kids play. Sammy is practically satan, but is not! The other two morons rating are no brainers. Alice and sammy are just evil. I heard my 12 and 14 year old sons playing this, and, they said I should play it. Well, I did, and I got addicted! Fast! Sammy says this in a part of it. Sheep sheep sheep, It's time for sleep Rest your head It's time for bed In the morning you may wake Or in the morning you'll be dead!
I watched my son (10) play this after buying it for him for Christmas. I was wary at first as there were 2 reviews on this website calling it an 18+ game. These reviews are garbage. There's no blood or subliminal messages. The design of the game is very artistic and it's more of a puzzle game than anything. The jumpsares (there's like 2) make you jump a little then laugh. Of course it's a bit sinister but definitely not nightmare fuel. This is a fun , puzzle game for ages 10 and up.
Good game
My daughter enjoys this game. It’s pretty cool. There is some violence but no gore or blood, only ink. It’s easy to play, and sex and language aren’t present at all.
it may be scary for young ones, but theres really nothing mature in this game
this game seemed iffy at first but this game is awesome for 12 year olds. honestly, if your kid is 7 and wants this game don't buy it. but its a really fun game and my kid loved it. it may have some iffy ideas abpout souls and scary characters but its harmless. I mean no sex or language at all. It is a really good game and if you are wondering if you want to buy this for your kid, just ask yourself, is your kid fine with scary things? Does he or she play horror games like five nights at freddys for instance. If they have, they would definitely be able to play this and would not be scared. it is a laid back game and is not bad at all. I rate this 5 stars
This game I was contemplating getting this game for my 12 year old and I decided to buy the game and if I did not like it, I would send it back. I bought it and watched him play it. I was at first wondering about the factor of possession and soul stealing. although there may be some iffy ideas here, this game is overall harmless. I watched him play the game and beat it three times in all. over all this game has awesome graphics, no themes of sex or language at all. no bad morals or themes whatsoever. Awesome game. Even I started playing. I rate this game 5 stars.
I think that unless your religious or anything, this game won’t harm your children. There are pentagrams and such shown in the game, yes, but not shown in a way that your children should replicate that. Also, while there is a bit of violence in the game, none of it is very graphic and there is no blood and gore, only ink. And the game is not very scary at all, it’s more of a puzzle game than anything. I definitely feel that your children will be perfectly fine playing this game.
No sex, profanity, blood or gore. Old timey cartoon demons, creepy ink monsters that chase you and a mystery to solve. Lost souls, Chucky still devil worship implied and some killing of monsters. It's awesome. I've watched my son play and beat this game three times. Pentagrams, evil illustrators toutured souls, ink monsters and jump scares activate.
yes it may ave the projectionist's head ripped off and Sammy Lawrence gets killed by an ax I don't see anything wrong with it. there is no blood at all just ink. there are pentagrams around the studio but other than that I would give it 1,000,000,000 thumbs up!
not bad at all the only thing is that someone dies, but gets reincarnated.
There isn't that much horror in this game. It's mostly jump scares, mixed in with the occasional pentagram or deformed character/ink blob. For the lowest age rating, I would say probably a really mature 9-year-old or a mature 10-year-old. Other than that, an 11-year-old would handle this just fine.
my dad thinks this is a really good game i do too. i like all the jumpscares chapter 1 is hard and 4 is hard. There is some violence. Spoilers: Some characters known as the butcher gang are a little too scary. i like t'hat you can take weapons like an axe to defend yourself. Its sad sometimes. Final judgment: four thumbs up!
This game is honestly really fun. It has a very interesting and investing story line that pulls you in and can keep you entertained- wanting to learn more about the story every second you spend playing it. It's creepy and overall, enjoyable! The game doesn't have much to be concerned about. It has extremely cartoony violence. It does have a bit of what I call 'ink gore', though; where it has 'gore', but it's not blood- it's just ink. It's not much to be concerned about, however, as it holds no realism. The game's animation represents that of a 3D, interactive child's cartoon.
Rythm and fun!
This game is easy to learn and fun to play for all age groups. Most young children (5+) should be able to play on easy settings - though it will take time. Older kids should pick it up easily straight away. Besides being fun this game teaches coordination, timing, and rhythm. If it is mirrored to a TV it is also good fun for the whole family as every family member can watch one another play the game.
Fun arcade game for teens and up
It's an arcade style game. Very little story. The goal varies between winning a race, getting to an objective in time, and taking out opponents. Between each "level" you can purchase upgrades and refills. While I haven't seen any drug or alcohol use or heard any dialog about it yet, some of the upgrades are drugs that give you boosts. Between that, the violence, and the frequent swearing, it's not a great game for the little ones, but could definitely be ok for older kids who can handle that sort of thing. The 4 player split screen even on PC makes it something you can play with your older kids that you'll probably all get into.
I'm Very Happy With It
It's Great!
It's okay...
Pretty good game.
Awsome!
I love it!!!
What’s all the fuss about
#momlife it is horrible for your kids do not ever let them play
I have this game and I'm in LOVE with it. It's totally appropriate for kids, it's teaches a good lesson, it's great.
Let's face it, The Sims 4 is totally inappropriate for kids. From getting drunk to getting pregnant. My kids used to love The Sims 4 and played all the time. I liked it too until I saw stuff I didn't. Before I took my kids off, I thought to myself. "There has to be another version of the game.". Then, I found this. The Sims 4 Get Famous it totally appropriate and worth every penny I spent for it. My kids are now addicted to it, and it doesn't have any sex.
To be honest, it's an okay game. No sex, no violence. It's fun, you're finding your way in life. Yes, you can go on dates. You can have parties, jobs, and different careers. It does have consumerism. You have to save money to get what you want.
The Sims 4: Get Famous is about become a celebrity. I play it almost all the time. It has mild violence, but it also gives great message. It's telling you that you can be whoever you want to be as long as you put you mind to it.
My two sons just started playing The Sims Get Famous and I really like what I see so far. When the characters use the restroom, the parts are blurred. There isn't any sex so far. Although there is a tad bit of violence. Electrocution, passing out. Other than that, it's absolutely perfect.
I let my 13 - year - old daughter play this game, and at first I was a little skeptical after so much I've heard about The Sims 4. But then I decided to let my child have a little freedom and go ahead and play. I found out that the original game of The Sims 4 has most of the sex in it. But The Sims Get Famous is so much more appropriate for teens and tweens.
This game is fine for kids 7 + but don’t play at night some scenes are scary
even i played it and i am still scared no way i would let any of my three girls use this
Great Game - unsupervised chat not for children
Could be great
There is 1 Great Game Among Us
Fun but get ready for some language
VERY Inappropriate
Not appropriate for kids
Are others actually thinking about repercussions when they review this game?
great game
Not for 10 year olds but fun
Not for kids
Game is very tame - Chat can be a problem
Deductive Party Game for Kids
disappointed with chat/cyberbullying
Appropriate for kids...in the right environment
My Colorblind Child
Very Inappropriate for Younger Children
good game idea, but too much cursing
Good with friends, horrible online.
This is among kids
Good for kids older than 10
A fun game for kids, unfortunately the chat function means that there will be a lot of inappropriate and downright dangerous information being passed back and forth. I'll let my teenager play the game but our 10 year old is only allowed to play it in a private game room with people we know. I really wish games like this were designed with moderators observing chat to make sure children are allowed to remain children.
This is a cute game and the idea is great however......There are very foul mouthed immature teens that play this game. I played for a whole week and I thought 80% of the time was like this. It seems to be a fun hangout for bullies as well. They constantly put others down. Now if the language filter is on it may not be as bad but, then the conversations are just riddled with ******. I would say it's been overrun by immature bullies and may not be fun for some. If only there were moderators like other mmo games.
Among Us is a game where there is 1 imposter among 10 little spacemen and the innocent spacemen have to figure out who the killer is. Overall there is a little blood but take a red colouring pencil and draw a few circles on a page. That's the blood in this game. Use of guns and knives to kill people Lying Possible language in chat, but European servers are way less vulgar
The game itself is clever, simple and fun, but the chat exposes kids to all kinds of inappropriate language, name calling and sexual innuendo at times.
This game is extremely fun, but very inappropriate. The objective and the idea is very addictive and enjoyable, but the chat feature is NOT good for anyone younger than 15. I’ve seen so many children say their age and their school in the chat when my child was playing. I’ve seen players make VERY sexual references in the chat. This is NOT something that you want your child playing. Players have asked other players to sleep with them (obviously using vulgar language) and for all you know, that could be your child being asked that. Yes, you can have the chat censored, but people easily get around that. Instead of saying a swear, players will leave out a letter in the swear so that it doesn’t censor. All in all, this is a fun game, but it’s not safe or good.
My 12 yr old son heard all his friends talking about this app. It allows you to chat with others not in your contacts. There is an option to censor the chat which we turned on but the very first time I got on to use it someone was using explicit language. We immediately deleted it.
1. Children should not be open to chat from total strangers! I believe this can be restricted, but then it can also be unrestricted. Only takes one error of judgment from your child to allow communication from totally shady people and I know I wouldn’t want any child to face the risk. 2. The need to kill anyone or anything in a game is surely not something kids need to think is acceptable at any level.
it a good game you can play it with friends or with your family the only thing wrong is that people swear if you play with a random lobby and the toxic players on pc if you want to avoid playing with them play on your Android phone instead
It is extremely violent and there IS blood even tho common says there isn’t any trust me I play it they literally shoot you in the face stick their tongue through your eyes and snap your neck what do u expect also it can ruin friendships and lying to your friends becomes normal suddenly
Extremely inappropriate and adult content shared between all players, inappropriate screen names, dark and un-safe conversations. Not a place for children.
I'm adding to this discussion to clarify that the game itself isn't the least bit scary or graphic. To start, you pick a color for your character along with a silly hat. If you're the "imposter," you are indeed supposed to kill the "crew mates" but you do it by pushing a button when you're standing next to them. You don't choose how they're killed and there's nothing malicious about it. They fall over and look like brightly colored little hams with one big bone sticking out. It's just silly. I also want to add my own kids' experience with the oft-mentioned chat feature. It's mostly been innocent, but one player mentioned at the start of a game that they were planning to kill themselves (in real life). My 16-year-old chatted a bit with this person and determined that they sounded serious, so she gave them the suicide prevention hotline number and urged them to seek help (they said they would). She and my 11-year-old son play this game a lot and 99% of the time, nothing bad happens, but you just never know what anyone will say. We've also seen some hateful messages, ostensibly from Trump supporters (they name their characters Trump2020, etc.). Bottom line - if you're 100% sure your kids know not to share any personal information in chats and can just ignore unpleasantries, Among Us is fine for any age, but you should keep an eye on it.
Among Us is a good game for teaching children the ins and outs of deductive reasoning and socialization. The cartoonish violence is fun and it's a good game to get a group of people together and enjoy. A passing fad to enjoy while it lasts.
My daughter and I both enjoy playing. However it is disappointing when a group of kids/adults play as a group. Chatting or on a call with each other and gang up against others. Then again that is ok but what is not ok is belittling them. Calling them suckers and hos because they were caught as the imposter. Word of advice from this mom is to be present. If your kids are in a room with only 4 people chances are 2 or 3 of them are working together and can get nasty to the single person out.
Parents should know that, in terms of gameplay, "Among Us" isn't very objectionable; getting killed will catch you by surprise at first, but the animations are mild and cartoony. The real issue here is in public lobbies, in which strong language and names of a sexual nature are common ("Horny boy/girl" is common, as well as "need a bf/gf".) There is a profanity filter enabled by default; however, it suffers from the Scunthorpe problem and censors completely inoffensive words, making communication with other players confusing at times and making it more likely a child will want to disable the profanity filter. As such, this game should be played either under close adult supervision or with people that a child knows through family, school, etc. They can create their own private lobbies and even find a way to set up a voice communication through Skype, Discord, etc. to get the full potential of the game without worrying about offensive conduct.
My son is colorblind. Game isn’t colorblind friendly. Would be helpful if he could ID based on patterns, etc not color.
Yes this game is fun but the unmoderated chat feature can be dangerous. I often play with my kids (9, 11, and 13) and one room had so much inappropriate behavior that I'd consider it cyber bullying. One comment said "suck my ****". Literally just like that. All censorship will only cover words with asterisks and many players will be creative to bypass this in chat or even their name. We were even the admin in this game and couldn't ban the individuals being inappropriate. There's discussions on "hacking" the game like this. I've also had games where players say they're 6 or 7. If you let your kids play, make sure they're ready to play with adults and teenagers. Please teach your kids internet safety.
I love the idea of this game. A simple overview of this game is the crewmates are trying to finish their tasks and figure who the impostors are, and the impostors are trying to kill the crewmates. However, a lot of people in the chat use curse words. Some only meant to express it to the game situations, but there are some who curse to the respective person saying that their ****, and etc. There is once where (my younger child) have experienced a boy asking her to be his girlfriend or something.
Not only is the online community very frustrating to even play with but they are also very toxic (meaning sore losers but in a much nastier way, like swearing). If your kid cant handle that stuff online, then just let them play with friends however online play should be rated 11+.
the chat is not the most appropriate, little bit of gore, and inappropriate names that you can call yourself. But it is so interactive though and they invented something called sus short for suspicious. I started to say it to a bit. It might get a bit addictive once you play it. But it is still a good game just if you are under the age 14 I would not look in chat because they can ask for your privacy
It depends on the kid and how well they take mature topics, the chat is not filtered so people can say whatever they want but you can keep your kids away from hearing bad words all the time
