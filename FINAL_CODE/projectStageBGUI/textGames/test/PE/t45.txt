Overwatch is an FPS for kids.

Awesome game by Blizzard
Very fun and diverse game.
Great Game!
cms back at it again with the crazy reveiews
great role models for teens struggling with their identity.
Overwatch!!
Ok, so... this game is actually more 10 and up. 1st, McCree is smoking a cigar, not a joint. a tip in the chat problem, if you are playing ps4 or xbox one, hop into a party. at least i think. on ps4, prioritise party chat audio. on xbox, idk I'm a ps4 gamer.
This game is definitely good for kids!!! My dad is very cautious about the video games that I play, but still decided to purchase the game for me. I got it when I was 12 years old, and I'm now 13. He has watched me play before and thinks it's great. I will admit it VERY OCCASIONALLY uses the word damnit when a character is upset, but it doesn't matter because a lot of parents don't understand that kids here worst stuff at school all of the time. It has a great message that the world could always use more heroes and you should show your kids some animated short which bring a great message. The character Mccree smokes a cigar but that is just because he is a classic western cowboy. Violence is fine for kids if all ages. In fact, my cousins, (4 and 6) have played the game before. It is a colorful kid friendly game and is the only game I've played in months!!! FAVORITE GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be aware some female characters may show some boob and butt.
It is not a bad game there is blood BUT as hard as I try to see it, it's still really hard to notice. I would say this game is one of the best games ever and it is VERY beginner friendly so if you are thinking of getting a first person shooter I would highly recommend this. The consumerism is up for this one because there is a lot of clothes and such you can get but everything there is worth buying 100 times because it is such high quality. The worst thing probably in this game is one character (McCree) has a cigarette but it is VERY hard to notice during gamepley and you only really notice it during close ups which happen for at max 5 seconds at a time but if you are going to stop your daughter/son over this statement think again because so many people in the world smoke so your daughter/son will probably just see it in-game then not care because they know smoking is bad.
Overwatch is a 6v6 first person shooter(FPS.) As most FPSs are they can be violent. But overwatch isn't. The game has 23 characters. There is one character that is smoking. Mcree, but as a cowboy that is usuall. Some of the female characters are kind of "revealing" by there out fits.
I've played Overwatch for about a month and it's a very fun game. This game is fine for kids because there is such little blood that you have to have a magnifying glass to see it. This game has a wide variety of characters to choose from and it only take minutes to learn how to use them. I will admit that some of the female characters do have slightly revealing outfits, but you could just as likely find a random woman walking down the street with a similar outfit. I'm just going to recap Blood:No, Gore:No, Violence:Characters falling to the ground, Sex:Slightly revealing outfits, Swearing:Minimal, Drug/Drinking:A cigar
Other shooters are very violent but overwatch is very fun and goofy. Its a game for everyone to enjoy!
This game is amazing and I'm basically addicted. But honestly, Mccree smoking a cigar is not considered drugs. Yeah, some female characters may be a little underdressed (I mean like very little) but that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is teamwork to push a cart (Payload) to an objective or to take control of a point (Hardpoint if you've played Call of Duty). Overall, this game was actually made for kids and so many other people love it. When CSM says that there is blood when I have never seen blood yet.
Overwatch is a colourful futuristic first person shooter. There are twenty-one heros to choose from and customise. They are all unique individuals, and whilst there are different character roles every character feels different. Widowmaker's outfit does not cover up the whole of her upper body, but nothing over sexual is shown. I only occasionally encountered blood (usually when shooting at very close range) and there wasn't much of it. I'd say that this game is fine for age eight and up, but that would only be for watching an older sibling play it.
Way too highly overrated. Sure, the graphics are ok, but gameplay, not so much. No story, all multiplayer, which sucks. The gameplay is way to frenetic, makes no sense, and makes you think, what the heck is going on! In the end, it feels like your playing something out of the Disney Infinity. Go play Destiny if you want a rated T shooter.
Listen, there are lots of gory first person shooters out there, but Overwatch is basically the opposite. It's an amazing game, and it's good for kids. There are general messages of doing the right thing. In fact, one of the character's signature messages is "The world is worth fighting for!" The review here gave a couple of minor bumps, such as McCree who smokes a cigar (https://goo.gl/images/eTlS88) which I honestly think is really not that big a deal. I mean, he's basically a cowboy. What do you expect? Also, they commented about the design of the character Widowmaker (https://goo.gl/images/r3nfK7) and how it could be seen as "sexual" but, basically, it only is if you want it to be. So, if you don't (as you probably don't); whatever. It's fine. They also mentioned voicechat and the simple text chat and how you could be exposed to profanity, etc. But, if you simply go into the settings for these things while in a game by pressing P, you can configure it so you don't hear voicechat and, in extreme measures, not see text chat. Of course, text chat is basically necessary when people pick more than one of the same character, because, for example, some characters (well, 2) can make turrets, so if you're defending a control point, you can ask them to make turrets around it, so that it's more difficult for enemies to attack. Overall, Overwatch is an amazing game, and is child friendly, which is a pretty rare mix. Normally it's either meant for teens and adults, and it's good, or it's good for kids, but it's bad. But, Overwatch is a wonderful mix of the two that I play whenever I have spare time.
Great game and awesome multiplayer.But,this does have things that you might be concerned about.Well,to start,the only cusses they say are d*mn and h*ll.Second,if you look on the back of the cover,you'll see Use of tobacco.The only tobacco is a character called McCree smoking a cigar.And the blood is only cartoon.The last thing ESRP didn't rate,probably because most people don't notice it,is McCree's belt,which says BAMF.Now,you probably don't know what that stands for but it's bad.Bad A*s Mother Fu**er.It's hard to see and most children don't understand it.If they do I suggest saying that it's BAMF as in if someone gets punched in a Batman comic book.Other than that it's great fun.Hope this helped!!!!
I LOVE Overwatch. I researched the lore when it first became available, I watched gameplay, I was so excited. When it came out, I was disappointed that my computer wouldn't run it(I have a several-year-old laptop that honestly isn't the best) but expected it. Fast forward to November and the free weekend. I played it and it, honestly, was pretty great. My favorite hero was Lucio because he seems like a character out of Jet Set Radio, one of my favorite games. This game does have unmoderated voice and text chat, but I only had one toxic experience in the probably 20-30 games I played. The characters are pretty good role models(They always protect the innocent, work towards peace, etc) and have diverse backgrounds, such as Lucio coming from Mexico, Pharah coming from Egypt, Reinhardt coming from Germany, and Genji and Hanzo coming from Japan. Heck, you can even play as a robotic monk! It's an amazing game. My only hope is that I get an Xbox One/PS4/can build a better computer so I can actually play this like it was meant to be played.
The game is very fun, barely any swearing (occasionally someone says damn.), all the characters are very diverse, many different races, and one character is gay. All the characters are from many different backgrounds. Chinese, Indian, white, black, and some are even robots!
Okay so this game is great, It's probably without a doubt my favorite game. Something I see in the reviews is "revealing clothing on characters" Do you realize that you would see even less clothes on a real person, not a fake character, if you took your child to the beach. Honestly, have you ever heard of a bikini? The only curse word in the game is d*mn, and honestly I don't even class that as a curse word. The only smoking in this game comes from the cowboy character, and honestly what cowboy movie or game doesn't have a cigar? The game is very easy to play. It has a lot of positive role models and not every character is a straight white male. The character on the front of the game is a lesbian for goodness sakes and we have several characters of different religions and cultures. I also see the need to mention that it does not attempt to impose any religion on the player. As for consumerism, the only things you can buy are cosmetics, not a single thing that actually changes the gameplay can be purchased.
did he just call one character smoking a cigar drugs in the words of filthy frank you sir are an idiot
the main character/hero is called tracer, tracer is a lesbian. she is on the front cover. how amazing is that? this game is multicultural, cheap in price, constantly updated and monitored and all profanities are blurred out. great game 10/10. PS. it won game of the year.
This game is sooooooo fun! For it's genre, it is not THAT violent. The only problem is that some of the characters (or heros) are very dark themed. Overall, this is a games rating speeks for itself.
really, CSM
great game
Great game, but violence is basically all about it.
No blood or gore
Overwatch IS great
Overwatch is awsome
This should be a PEGI 7.
Amazing game!!! I highly recomend it to your tweenage kids!
MMO is content short, but in total a blast
Great Game. PG Rated. With Consumerism
Great game for all those who have a PlayStation 4, XBOX One, or PC
Strangers, Kids play with adults.
Mild violence and slight behavior change, but great overall
Game that keeps on being fun!
No age restriction needed.
Awesome
Fine for kids ages 11 and up
The best game I have ever played in my life(as of August 2nd, 2016)
im 14 and its ok for 8 and up i mean really it should be e10+
This game is fun, awesome and just appropriate slight reavealing outfits but its really fun, just played it a minute ago too ;) open mic chat though........
i got nothing
There is consistent violence and the going into the war genre, but I believe this is a step up from ten year old shooters, and a step down from call of duty. There is no swearing, but the whole game is based around violence, but I believe a mature eleven year old, or someone twelve or older should be allowed this game.
Overwatch uses futuristic guns but there is no blood or gore
I'm not saying that kids should start playing video games at an early age, I'm just saying that if your 5 year old wants to play it, let him/her play it.
I love this game so much it is really addicting and it is fun but there is a little blood it is kind of violent and there is a character that is smoking Tabaco and some slight inappropriate stuff but I recommend this game 9+
Nowadays games are rated too high. This is one example!
This game is rated teen probably because it's a first person shooter. But don't let that make you think it's a horrible game. There's barely any blood and there's no cursing. One character is constantly smoking a cigar, but other than that it's perfectly fine for tweens and up.
Overwatch is an MMO with no campaign and dozens of heroes to choose from. There is some violence when you shoot another hero, but the graphics are cartoony and there is only blood for a millisecond when you shoot someone. Some profanity spoken by the heroes, but it is usually no worse than hell or damn. There is an option where you can talk to other people on chat. Some of the female heroes have skimpy outfits. Also some heroes have more moral principles than others, but they all kill to get their war. In total this game is content short, but fun and addicting
Great Game. Appropriate for many ages. If your kid can watch PG movies then you're kid can play this game. If you're under 7 then it's probably not a good idea. Concerns for young kids: Lootboxes can cost money if you want extra. The chat and voice chat is open.
I think that Overwatch might be the best, friendly shooting game out there! The characters are fun and colorful and it's easy to pick up and play. The only problem is that kids can listen to what others over the internet have to say and sometimes thats not a good thing. There's definitely a few kids who will give out personal info which isn't ok. As long as your child is smart enough to not give or personal info this game is ok for them.
It is a great game, diverse characters, teaches you to strategize and improvise, and more! There is a bit of gore, and some characters can be revealing (tight clothes, v-necks) but it's pretty minor. Make sure your child doesn't play it too much, explain to them that its not real life, and how violence isn't good, etc... if you're concerned, its rare for your child to be like that, but it does happen. Monitor the play time and you should be fine. One other thing, be careful as this is a multiplayer game, people can chat, and they swear, a lot. If you use voice chat, you will find most players are adults. Other than that, I love the game, Haven't had any problems, and most people are really friendly! Though I very much think that no child under 10 should play this, I know from experience, it can be a toxic place sometimes. PLEASE be careful talking to strangers. The community is nice, but searching up images will get you very inappropriate things, lots of sexual drawings and more. I'm not concerned about the violence, but the people you play with.
The main point of the game, Overwatch, is to be able to work as a team to defeat the enemy team in a certain objective. After months of playing this nonstop for a few months, because this game is addicting (Consumerism), I have become very competitive on this game. This has changed my behavior with the game - angrier and more judicious of how others do things, because people don't know how to play the game, even in competitive mode - and has caused me to *attempt* to swear at my team. Yes, attempt to. In the Xbox and PS4 version of the game, players are usually not connected to the voice channels, thus making communication between players nonexistant. (Be careful if you're on the PC version, because it's much easier to voice chat here) Next topic Marker..... Though, Blizzard has made a decent solution to this; a wheel of communication, where players can say "Group of with me!" or greet them, etc. So, I can still somewhat communicate with my team, despite me not being able to use voice chat. Next topic Marker..... Overwatch is very mild on the violence compared to other titles similar to it; While you are still killing each other on the battlefield, no blood is ever shown, unlike games like Battlefield. Next topic Marker..... If you were to play in the game, you would know that there's this system of "Loot Boxes," where you can open these up to get 4 random items. In a way, this is gambling. I have heard many stories of people buying 50+ loot boxes at once and spending a ton of money, so be careful if your child has your credit card information. They might buy some without you noticing. Next topic Marker..... In the lore of Overwatch, (youtube.com/users/playoverwatch), many characters are looking towards justice (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwFu8kEsUW4) and others look to disrupt them. The good people, as we shall call them, are very positive role models because they are basically your fairy tale "Heroes," they're the teacher to the student, they're the Romeo to the Juliet, etc. Children can always look up to the "Good Guys" of this game. Despite the choice of character design.
Overwatch is a team based online exclusive game that continues to be fun. Most parents are most likely turned away by the first Pearson perspective and guns but in all honesty the animation resembles Disney and there is no blood. I have only played Overwatch on my XboxOne so I was a bit annoyed that I had to purchase XboxLive but in the end I wasn't dissapointed. If you have a decent computer then that is probably your best option but playing on the Xbox or PlayStation is still incredible and is by far one of my favourite FPS games, up with Halo which I would suggest as an alternate to Overwatch if you want something different. Hope you found this useful have fun!
I don앖 think that there압 a problem with this game when it comes to violence. There is no such thing as blood or gore in this game. it압 probably one of the most tamest shooters i았e played. If you have a kid who knows how to hold a controller and likes cartoons this is the game to get. The gunplay is very very cartoonish and less vionent than most of the cartoons on Saturday morning TV. this game doesn앖 deserve an age restriction and 13+ is just silly... the only problem i had with the game is that it didn앖 hold my attention for a long time due to the lack of a campain. but as this sight is meant to age suggestions that압 kinda of topic
The Overwatch is an internatonal group of heroes fighting to save the world. The game introduces this story but does not follow it in the gameplay. In the game you play online with two teams. You can choose a hero and fight for your team. There are different groups of heroes that help out the team in different ways, such as support heroes who dont do much damage but can heal players on theyre team. There is an online voice chat, and I have run into some people who swear or say other questionable things but you can turn off the chat if your worried for your kid. The game itself isint that violent. There is a little bit of blood but its pretty rare and its a small amount. The blood is hard to notice in the fadt gameplay. The characters are awesome, and make you feel as awesome as them when you play. The game does not have level advantages so its all skill based witch might make the game harder for younger kids. There is a little language but VERY light and sometimes in different languages. The heroes are from all around the world so its cool when they have an accent or even speak another language! Its a great message for kids and a great game!
Overwatch is a first person shooter game where you play with other people online to complete objectives such as holding an area or moving a payload. The violence in the game is very cartoony and non-realistic. Most of the guns do not even shoot real bullets. There is a bit of blood, but it is very fake looking. If your kid is age 11 or older then Overwatch should be fine for them.
Beware of one character(Tracer, my first video-game crush) .
Its fun,colorful and one of the best games of 2015 alongside uncharted 4 and dark souls 3.Fun for kids of all ages also easy to play for thoes who arent as good as video games myself as an xbox player i really enjoy a good fps game.This is a good starter to the genra.I also reccomend to start out fps games thy starwars battlefront ,team fortress 2 portal 2, counter strike, destiny and battlefield 4
