This game is a masterpiece
This is one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. The gameplay is simple yet difficult. The armors and monsters all look fantastic.
What is basketball doing in my Casino game?
Great game for basketball fans
Good in terms of gameplay and modes, but not easy to learn.
More of a gambling simulator
Because NBA2K20 Should only Be For Ages 11
amazing
Imagine buying a sixty dollar game and having to pay for everything and the game has a literal slot machine. You heard me, actual gambling. Surprise mechanics, my ... They really need to change the rating. Honestly just get your kid a decent game that they can actually enjoy.
Great game. My only concern is that the Nba2k games are the same every year with no big changes.Also, it may take a little time to get use to the controls.
It's a very good, well-built game in terms of graphics and gameplay. The modes were very well built, with MyCareer and MyLeague. MyGM is a little disappointing, but ok nonetheless. The MyPlayer builder is AMAZING! Now, onto the cons. You don't really get to upgrade your MyPlayer much without VC. You'll probably get to about 88 OVR if you're lucky. Another thing is consumerism. In MyCareer, your player openly gets deals with different brands sponsored by the NBA, such as Beats, Gatorade, and Foot Locker. You can also choose between shoe brands such as Jordan, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Anta, and New Balance. They openly promote these products. There is also a shoe builder, where you can create your own shoe. You choose between any brand you want.
Worse than fallout 76
a great game that is fine for kids of all ages
gg
Difficult. If your kid's been playing games for five years, shooters, mostly, they'll be good enough at it.
Age 11 100%
i think it is good because of the reactions
Gears 5 is a game which yes may have a bit of blood but hat can be turned off in the settings . So the only bad thing is the language but the language isn’t really really bad it uses the s word and a very few amount of f bombs . The only reason I’ve said 11 is because of the language . Other than that the game is great. In addition this game also represents teamwork .
This is only pseudo-freemium, and one of THE BEST "action" games for younger kids!
Fun for the whole family.
Brief intro, I'm somewhat familiar with a lot of freemium models for games, I always seem to try them out, most I quickly give up on. Super Kirby Clash, however, is part of a "new style" of freemium that is MUCH more about "paying what's appropriate" than manipulating you to pay for the same thing multiple times. So let's back up a moment, and say why it's good. You can play with 4 people at a time (including locally on one Switch), with simple controls, against engaging and cartoony bosses. Even if you take damage and run out of "stamina", your character falls down, yells "Help!", and someone can come over and press a button to pick them back up with some health. It's extremely forgiving, the only way to "lose" is to run out of time, or if everyone gets knocked out at once. I played with my 6, 7, and 8 year old (two boys, one girl), all pretty new to video games, and they all loved it. There are 4 different "roles" to play, and it was neat to see them choose the role they like best. You also have very simple upgrades to weapons and armor, which update very simple stats. It is an extremely chill but engaging game, especially for adults to play with kids. Now, let's circle back to the freemium model. The "premium currency" is "gem apples", you spend them for various kinds of progression. However, putting money into the game gives you a PERMANENT increase to the amount of gem apples you get every 12 hours. The cheapest is less than a dollar, to buy 50 gem apples, and which will forever give you 20 gem apples every 12 hours instead of 10. You can also spend gem apples, fairly cheaply, for other kinds of benefits that permanently improve playtime or progression. That's why I call this "pseudo-freemium", because it's almost like you're paying for the number of boss battles you can reasonable expect to unlock and win against. Because most of the "game" isn't progression through some story, but choosing a boss fight, choosing an interesting combination of roles, trying to beat your record time, or trying to get all the achievements for a particular boss. And all in a way that's still extremely accessible for young kids. Using gem apples to refresh your playtime is extremely cheap, compared to how many you get every 12 hours, so there's very little lost when losing a particular battle. Personally, I tried out the game, looked at the options, and chose the one that was about $4. That gives me 30 gem apples per 12 hours (tripling the original rate), and I've never needed to put in more money. I've already unlocked enough interesting boss battles to last our family for quite a while. And I just think it's great to see examples of "freemium" moving away from merely predatory, to more of a "pay for what you want" model, where you can choose between the "budget price" and the "full price" depending on how seriously you want to take the game. That all being said, I only give it four stars, because some of the information I have put here is NOT very clear or obvious in the game. I feel like the game needed a better tutorial or consolidated reference page. The game works best when there's an adult to "facilitate" things, especially getting those permanent benefits early. Also, yeah, if kids play unsupervised you need to put your credit card behind a password. But with those caveats, it's still one of the best whole-family action games on the Switch.
I love that super Kirby clash is available on the switch. It is free to play but you can make purchases to speed up character ability progression in the game. Super cute game, clean crisp graphics, and I love you can play with 4 people!!! Definitely give it a try.
Really good game!
A Great Family Game
I hope there will be more games like fireboy and watergirl on hudgames.
We bought Torchlight 2 for everyone in our family, and we play it together sometimes on Family Game Night through our local Ethernet. (We wired all the rooms in our house with Ethernet, so we have our own network.) The game is a fun point-and-click adventure that takes up where Torchlight left off. To begin a new game, you pick your character, either a berserker, an embermage, an outlander, or an engineer. You can choose to be either gender, with a plethora of choices for hair style, hair color, and face. Then you pick and name a pet. Pets are important, because you can send your pet back to town to sell items you don't want and buy items you do want, like healing potions. You start by getting a quest to go to a nearby town. The beginning leg of the journey is rather easy, regardless of difficulty, allowing the player to learn the interface as he goes. Once in town, you get more quests and uncover more of the storyline. I have played the main quest to completion three times, as an embermage, outlander, and engineer. Torchlight 2 contains lots of side quests, a hidden quest, and a lot of entertaining options along the way. For people worried about privacy or safety, you can play the game all the way through by yourself. You do not need to log into a network. Torchlight 2 also has a local co-op option, with is how I play with my family. Again, only known people can (hopefully) access your local network. While the game is mainly played for fun, if you play with others, you learn how to work as a group. Also, figuring out which weapons or armor to use requires some math knowledge. Overall, I give Torchlight 2 a five-star rating.
get this game bro
If you've never played 8 before, buy it.
This game is AWESOME. it is not that violent and nothing bad exept for one or 2 curses that are in the game. f your kid is age 10 or up they should have lots of fun and not see or hear anything that bad.
But if you already have an older version, the improvements aren't really worth buying it again. The older Steam version can be modded to an even better state than this somewhat lazy cash grab.
Retro style dungeon crawler has smooth execution and pace. 2 player couch co-op.
Multiple retro "pixel art" games that throw back to the 16 bit era graphically are many times an ugly eye sore, not very compelling, too simple and repative or all of the above. Seemingly an excuse to make a cheap game with a low budget with the glaring problems. NOT SO HERE. If anyone remembers the Prince of Persia on PC, it was pixelated, but with realistic motion and engaging gameplay. Mix that with a classic Dungeons And Dragons theme with a literal storybook narrative and you have this. At first the learning curve seems a bit steep, but the mechanics of the gameplay show you the ropes little by little and you catch on a a bit more with each try. So you never hit a wall you can't level up past or accomplish so you don't beat your head against the wall. There CAN be a grind to get your character leveled, but each stab at any particular dungeon is randomly generated, and not in a cheap way, so that each run feels different with new challenges and puzzles to uncover. I never realized this until the third time and it makes each try more compelling instead of repetative and annoying. Within a few hours I unlocked several new abilities and became familiar enough that I was plowing through enemies "like a boss" where I had once felt intimidated. You can unlock new missions and characters by yourself or with local co-op, meaning you are not limited to 'online only' players and can just sit with a friend on the same console with an extra controller (very rare any more). No lie though, the buttons and what they do for trinkets, abilities and so forth take some time to get aquainted, but the game runs so smooth and the combat is deep enough that you'll WANT to take a few moments to get to know your layout, which is also customizable to change the buttons and what they do if you so desire. I have NEVER recommended a pixel art game before and have not recommended a true local co-op game of this ilk since Castle Crashers. Honestly, the game is downright beautiful at times and superbly animated. But if any of the above sounds compelling, look into this one for sure because I think it's a rare find, and to get my wife to drop her slow paced puzzle phone game to play an action RPG is almost impossible. Seriously.... I just may have to grind out her character a bit, but I'm fine with that. This is truly an 'easy to pick up' game that has depth if you want it. This game reminds me of the best Fantasy movie elements of the 80s and 90s movies, LOTR, Prince of Persia, Gauntlet and much of the best things of each rolled into one place. I'm loving it in so many ways. Only reason it's not a 5 star review is that this game does NOT have a difficulty setting and may be too frustrating for kids making this a take it or leave it scenario for entry and the boss fights can be often ABRUPT difficulty spikes making you have to retread dungeons again, even if they are different with each run through.
A police action-adventure game, but contains some emotional material
This is a really good game! I do think its a bit over priced at 60 bucks, but the content is mostly clean. The closest you get to anything sexual is a girl who has short shorts. There are a few occurences where a curse word is said, but not much of it. It's a difficult game, so if you're looking for something that'll be a breeze, this isn't a game for you. The only violence is animated fights where guns, blades, and more can be used.
This game is actually pretty good! I haven't seen any other action games where you take control of a police officer and stop crimes and other materials. Apparently you mostly fight these aliens called the Chimeras and sometimes criminals. Here's a tip for the stealth sections, you can control your Legion to bind enemies so you don't have to walk up to them from behind. Here's one intense part; the most intense part for some parents is when one of the main characters (Max Howard, the dad of the main character) dies early on in the game and where all of the weapons nicknamed the Legion turn on them. In fact, you don't get Max's Legion until File 08. There's a reference to drugs of mass destruction and some profanity, but someone who's like me, I can handle drugs and profanity because it isn't gross-inducing to me, but not realistic gore. Bayonetta and most M-rated action games have blood/gore but at least its unrealistic looking. There are puzzles which require a lot of brainpower, other puzzles have a "look before you leap" type situation, and then there are situations which are easy to mess up on, especially the parts where you need the Beast Legion to cross falling platforms.
Man of Medan: FUN!
Good Graphics,Bad Game
Great as long as your kid is mature
Spooky fun for movie night with friends.
I played this with my younger son Jimson, We had a blast! We passed the controller along and played together flawlessly, The language can be avoided easily and is quite light-hearted often making us laugh while the joke goes over the kids head, The blood is limited and scares are limited to creepy faces which turn out to be fake, This is a ghostly story that anyone mature can handle, If your son can handle the Arkham and spiderman games, They can handle this. I would recommend this to non- tech-savvy adults as well as children, I was worried about violence and swearing, but l ended up having my first gaming experience with my child, I would recommend this to everybody. The characters are funny, good role models and always give you the option to apologize and the game always puts the emphasis on saving your friends, Making it a must to be altruistic to your family members.
Until Dawn wasn’t the greatest game but it did have good characters,good actors and a some what good story to it. This game has none of that! It’s characters are dry and boring just like the story. The story doesn’t make any sense and is just plane random from the start. Don’t waste your money,just watch a YouTuber play it.
This game, man of medan, is great. Even though there is some blood, there is not much gore. There is some language, but it's no worse than fallout or call of duty. If your child is mature, than it shouldn't be a problem.
Entertaining, but loses appeal Solo (2 stars if so) due to less individual choice and consequence. The deaths (max 9 per playthru; not including NPCs) are not nearly as gory as Until Dawn but can get a bit bloody. Such as rats eating a body (though the rats haven't dug too deep yet), an offscreen throat cut with blood splatter, and a man slamming his head resulting in a large bloody pool. Others are bloodless like drowning and neck snapping. There are technically 69 total death scenes. But most are duplicates in slightly different contexts. Speaking of which, many depend less on choice and more on QTEs which is a bit disappointing. Fairly frequent language.
