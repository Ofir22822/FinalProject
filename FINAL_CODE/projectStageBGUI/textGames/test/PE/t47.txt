For parents who are considered getting the game for a child.
If your kid has common sense and a basic understanding what is right and wrong in real life they should be fine playing this game
An awsome miltary shooter sequel
Super
Fun tactical shooter with friends
Sequel to Wildlands is frustratingly good and difficult
Awful game with thrown away potential
Difficult and Strategically Challenging
Good
The game has a lot of violence cause it uses guns. The story is completely fine. It has a few no no words but nothing racist and no slurs, no sex, nudity, or drug use. It has a lot of blood but no gore like insides coming out. The game is fun and I recommend it to children. Don’t let them talk to strangers cause they say sum pretty bad stuff. Fun with friends. Let someone 9+ play (I’m not saying how to parent). Good day to all parents.
The game is solid, some cursing here and there but you can turn it on and off, some micro transactions, but they are not even close to essential to the game, just some cosmetics and redundant vehicles, no sex, drugs, no gore other than some blood but nothing too severe, i have experienced some bugs early in the games life that forced me to restart however when that did happen somehow I got a small amount of ghost coins, the currency you pay real money for and can only be spent on things like cosmetics, vehicles, and some weapons. most of the bugs from early game have been fixed as far as i know, however the AI is somewhat lacking in some areas. other than that if you played video games somewhat often (such as maybe 8-12 hours a month the controls should be easy to learn, but there are some things that might be hard to learn) there is one cut scene that in a couple seconds can be skipped that has some kissing, but can be skipped quite easily. Cursing probably would be a teen rating if not for the cursing, the cursing is not racist, or bigoted in any way that i could see, just things such as the F-word when something goes really wrong, and its usually muttered, and i think in a couple of instances a enemy yelled 'Get that M******" other than that couple things like "The hell" which while I might not consider it cursing some might so just though that I would mention it. If you don't want your kid playing with other people there is a solo mode where it gives you three AI teammates that are helpful.
Tom clancys latest game is a little buggy in coop, but still packs a awsome punch if you like shooter games and customazation. Few swears a little bit of blood but no organs or anything like that. No sexual inniwindows or consumerism other than a 1 year pass with sick dlcs relating to termanator or sam fisher plus free in game currany to customize your soldier nomad.A solid 9/10
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is the latest installment in the highly acclaimed Ghost Recon series. After the release of the new "immersive mode", I believe that this game is making substantial improvements beyond the release. The regular experience is how the game was played at launch. I didn't really enjoy the looter shooter concept as it is used in plenty of other games. Luckily the immersive mode makes the game feel more realistic and tactical. The custom mode is a sandbox that lets you customize the settings to your liking. I would still prefer regular mode for beginners, as you can still switch between the different modes instantly through settings. Campaign: Ghost Recon: Breakpoint has a really great campaign. The story makes sense, and is overall fun. The game takes place in Auroa, a fictional island with a great variety of climate and environment. You play as a highly trained soldier and spy called "ghosts". The only downside to the campaign is the extremely long downtime between missions. Lots of traveling and exploring. I find the campaign a lot more memorable with friends. PVP: Ghost Recon: Breakpoint isn't we'll known as a PVP game but it still exists. The competitive game modes are fun and tactical. Problems: Ghost Recon: Breakpoint has a disappointing amount of microtransactions. Mainly cosmetic items and more. There game's camera system is strange and shifts in an odd way. Vehicles are fun to play around with, but they have horrible drifting which can lead to frustration. Age Review: Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is a game necessary with friends and but can still be played alone. Overall, the violence is minimal. You shoot someone and there is little amounts of blood but no gore. Players use an arsenal of guns and explosives. Language however, is quite major in the story mode. F**k, s**t, b**ch, b***ard and more can be heard. Besides the story, the language isn't too bad. There are some sexual references in game but no scenes showcase it, with not much explicit detail. There are drugs in game, but nothing that your child hasn't seen in a movie or TV show. I'd be less concerned about that. Look Common Sense Media states, there is a torture cinematic cutscene but it's hardly shown. A man is strapped to a chair as a women interregates him. Afterwards the camera shifts off scene. If your child has read the original novel, "Ghost Recon" then the game may she similarities. In conclusion, decent game that's great with friends. Recommended for ages 13+
Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a sequel to Ghost Recon: Wildlands set in a massive and vast open world sandbox filled with tons of things to do, it's almost overwhelming. Including 30 hours worth of story missions, faction missions, side missions, encounters, raids and PvP. Violence is frequent moderate. Gameplay wise, violence is moderately bloody. With blood sprays, big puffs of blood while also mildly staining the environment. Shotguns cause big puffs of blood. Headshots with pistols cause a small burst of blood. Shots from fully automatic weapons cause constant blood sprays. Cutscenes and cinematics show more graphic depictions of violence. Torture scenes are graphic with blood staining the ground in some scenes. Characters bleed out and die. Language is frequent and strong. Use of the words "@$$", "@$$hole", "b#!ch", "f#!k", "motherf#!ker", "$h!t" are frequently heard in dialogue from cutscenes and gameplay. Example: "Shoot the f#!ker!", "What the f#!k?", "You've seen this place, god damn." and "Kill the son of a b!#ch!" Innuendo is present but infrequent.
Overhyped buggy mess. I played beta with my friends and right before release as well. Guns were buggy, but the cars had realistic drift mechanics (that was he only really good part). The M134 on the jeeps couldn’t turn and the game didn’t have an interesting story. The “expert review” author either hasn’t played the game, or is oblivious to its quality. DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE!!!!!
This game definitely includes violence, its a tactical military shooter. You play as a US Spec-Ops soldier, in a game based off a novel if you care about that. The game does include swearing, but not too much. If you don't want to expose your children to Moral decisions, this is a good one because there is a clearly defined good guys vs bad guys and little in between. I'd recommend it for anyone not easily upset and can think strategically, and lastly has patience.
Really good game I'm so happy I bought it your 12 Year old will love this
The best
Good, but not Perfect
ITS A BLAST AND ITS FREE
This is just like apex epic and action packed preteens and up should play this really
To anyone under the age of twelve, this will appear to just be another bullet sponge ridden game. However, there's a lot of depth to it that requires a lot of time to be put into. Some aspects require cooperation with others, so its best to stick with people who are mature enough to communicate clearly with others.
It’s a FPS consisting of team work while swearing is present if you can manage to put it to the side it’s an amazing game for youth I have personally put over 400 hours into it and there is not much blood and no gore. Hope my review helped you! Good day
Great game!
Honest review
Doesn't deserve 18+
Super gory, but fun.
Good for 13 and up
Great game and kind of historically accurate the only problem is the violence. But good news you can turn off kill cam so remember that before you let your child down.
Now this is a challenging game but definitely a fun one! It's a little violent but not so bad it's a fun game and I'd say 12 to 13+!
I played the first game and was hyped for the release of Sniper Elite 3, I was very disappointed with the product. The game is way too complicated, for example you have to be as stealthy as possible otherwise you will be heard resulting in enemies hunting you down. Then once you have 'stealth-killed' the enemy, you have to carry their body to the best hiding spot so it is not discovered, then you have to move as slowly and as quietly as possible so as not to be heard and to keep your heart rate down. Also each level is at least an hour long, then there is the multiplayer, which is a whole different topic. The only 'positive' feature of the game is the x-ray kill cam which is very gory , yet satisfying. However this is only achievable if the bullet finds its target which it probably won't. I like how the game tries to be realistic, but I would just save your money for the next Watch Dogs.
Sniper elite 3 puts you in the shoe of a sniper in north Africa. He has many different objectives he needs to complete and all of them revolve around making your way through maps filled with enemy troops. The main and ONLY thing that would trigger any parent's alarm would be the violence. If you shoot an enemy from a long distance and hit on target the game goes into and x-ray cutscene that shows the bones and main organs in the body. It then shows you where you have hit them and shows the bullet pierce wherever you have hit resulting in blood and some gore. Now the game is rated 16+ in England, does it deserve this rating? Yes, it does. Not because you should be 16+ to play it, but simply because it would be wrong to place the game at 12+. If your child has played anything from the likes of call of duty or battle field they will be fine with this game. The one exception to this is if they dislike blood! This game is great and the only factor is blood, not a problem for most! 12+ due to the x-ray cutscenes. Tips: if your child has a friend who plays this game and you have multiplayer access then this is great! If you are worried about the "unmoderated chat" in some of the reviews on this site than you can edit parental settings in consoles. Hope this review was helpful and helped you understand why you child of 12 or older should be playing this game!
This game can get really hard. You can change the frequency of the and Xray camera, which shows in Xray vision EVERY body part breaking. Some cussing that isn't horrible.
This game is fine for 13+. There is some gore and violence and some mild language. The game takes place during WWII so there is some learning
It is for everyone!
One of the best games in Playstation History
Could be better.
Cool ;D
Horrible
Fun but can be pay to win sometimes
Excellent fun! Recommend to all ages!
Better than the last 2 but still pretty crap compared to 12-15
Waste of time
Fantastic family game
GREAT FOR SOCCER FANS!
Just like the last one
What is bad in football? everyone can play
I say 3+ cause a 2 yr old wouldn't know how to play!!! Other than that, it is very good!!!! Positive messages and role models and I love ?ngel Di Mar?a on FIFA 20!!!!!! No violence or anyhting, just pure and lovely football with fantastic graphics
Well... It is not the best Fifa I've played. The speed thing in Fifa 19 was fixed but that's kind of all they fixed. The scoreboard constantly crashes and the score disappears. Career mode is so unrealistic. If you have a team of the best players ever, they could be beaten by Ajax. The character creator is cool. There is so many more options like running style, etc. But even if everything is maxed out at 99 on a custom character, he/she won't have 5 star skills. Being a person that loves creating players, this is so disappointing. The only way to get him/her 5 star skills is mods, and I'm not doing that. Volta is Ok, too. So overall, not the best Fifa, but it's ok.
I really like this game and you should definitely check it out!
The amount of 18+ content in this game is unbelievable worse than some of the Call of Duty's. My kids have been scared for life and are still in therapy.
I think it is a good game for children who are into sports and football and the game is really easy to become very good at against the A.I. but be warned I've had a fair share of online predators and swear bombs on the online section
Great fun! Exactly like a proper match just on a TV Screen. Controls take some getting used to which is why maybe kids younger than 8 would struggle but otherwise it's an excellent game. The game itself seems to know tons about the sport and more. You can create your own ultimate team, your own player or players, and there's an online chat which you can use as well. All in all a brilliant game for anybody who's used a controller before. PlayStation, Xbox and Windows. 10/10 for me.
Absolutely horrible game. They’ve recycled the same game for 5 years now and at this point there’s no use buying the newest game. Very strong theme of gambling too. You can buy fifa points to open packs in hopes of getting good players. However, it is usually a scam and you end up getting bad ones. The point of it is to keep buying packs using real life money until you get a good player. I wouldn’t recommend at all
Great for everyone yet it takes time to learn the controls, perfectly safe unless you use the online mode which includes voice chat which could be harmful towards smaller kids.
There is nothing mature about this game. Any age could play it. The soundtrack also never fails to disappoint. Relatively simple to play. A bit too similar to the last one. But anyone who LOVES soccer is bound to enjoy playing this incredibly realistic game.
Ok career mode is definitely broken i played my friends and i am definitely not buying it myself
