Fun, addictive, and a great entry into the roguelike genre.
Great game for teens and mature children
Risk of Rain 2, the sequel to the roguelike masterpiece that is Risk of Rain, is one of the best games I have played and lives up to the original's standard of quality. Players get dropped onto a variety of stages and collect a random selection of items before fighting bosses to advance to the next. This game is a third-person shooter with quite intuitive controls across all platforms. If you cringed in fear of violence when reading "shooter", don't worry - there is no blood nor gore in Risk of Rain 2. Enemies simply disintegrate upon death, and no monster can be described as scary, unless you consider a giant lizard or a robot ball to be scary. The amount of unique items with details about them only accessible in a logbook (which you can't view while playing a game) makes this a wee bit inaccessible to newer players. However, the complexity of the item system gives the game lots of depth, and strategically thinking about what items synergize with the ones you have is a key component of the game.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This is an extremely hard game, if your kids are looking for an easy and simple game, this is not for them. If your kids like a challenge then it should be suitable. Extremely fun rouge-like with consistent replay-ability Great game with frequent content updates Lots and items and customisation 10/10 Very Fun
It’s not that violent
Awesome
I’ve been playing the game for a year and there is almost no violence And no swearing or drugs or sexual content so I think it is appropriate for 12 year old or over
Its rlly good and it teaches you about the theory of evolution so ye
Great Game.
very good game, a bit violent
Brilliant Smash'em-up
The game is so fun. I think its for 12+. You see bodies fly sometimes but its like dummies. If you don't like crashing don't play because it's a demo derby game. Best demo derby game I've played. It gets 5 stars.
wreckfest is AWESOME! its so fun to smash, crash and bash crs! multiplayer is especially awesome, now this is coming from an 11 year old, there is a small bit of violence, on vehicles like motorcycles or lawn mowers, if you hit them a dummy will fly off. theres no blood/gore but they still fling like dummies. thats really all though, otherwise it's awesome!
This metal grinding, car smashing extravaganza named wreckfest is an absolute blast to play and even watch from youtubers or just plain old chill'in on the couch kind of watching. The over the top wrecks and wounds from cars t-boning them is spectacular to see and gives out a satisfying feel to it. In my opinion, every gamer who loves to be destructive in games should 100% at least try this game in all its over the top, exciting glory.
A great eeyrie game with violence.
An Excellent Game That Common Sense Doesn't Do Justice
Great game for mature teens or young adults
This is an amazing game. There is a decent amount of violence, not too much. There are some blood splatters and kinda jarring for some people but you kinda forget about it and get swept up in the story. There isnt too much swearing or violence but you should be aware of it. The game looks amazing and you dont actually kill normal people but kinda zombies instead
To start, I think the review done by Common Sense Media is very inaccurate, almost like the reviewer never finished the game and wrote it off as a mediocre three stars and slapped on a ridiculous 18+ rating. Expect a long read ahead. You will not see "bodies hanging from ropes" and that brings me into the topic of violence in Control. There is some violence (Mainly comprising of dead bureau staff and puddles of blood) and no gore, but it is not gratuitous and although containing very dark themes it is not deserving of an 18+ rating. Hitting enemies known as the Hiss results in sprays of chromatic particles and red light which somewhat resembles blood but is more impressive than disturbing. There are a few types of enemies, the main ones of which are the Hiss. The Hiss is an invading force in The Oldest House (The building that the game takes place in) which can corrupt sections of the building and its workers, either making them float in the air and chant nonsense, or transforming them into many variants of inhuman creatures that you fight throughout the game. Gameplay itself is smooth and easy to learn as you gain abilities while progressing through the main story and side missions. Throughout the campaign you will come across "Objects Of Power" and cleansing them are what gives you your abilities which include Launch, Evade, Shield, Levitate and more. Controls story is extremely intriguing, as the protagonist Jesse Faden starts the game just as confused as you are, and all this vagueness and confusion is an important aspect of the story that Remedy Games thankfully gets very right. It instills a sense of mystery and makes you want to read every one of the hundreds of colletible documents, videos, and audio recordings scattered throughout the bureaus incredibly detailed environments. Whether it be office cubicles, interdimensional thresholds, or the Astral Plane itself, Control has some of the most incredible visuals I've ever seen in a game. I played through Control on a PC utilizing Nvidias RTX ray tracing technology, and it is simply jaw-dropping. The physics are incredible and every tiny detail is gorgeously rendered with perfect reflections, global illumination, and excellent animations and facial capture. In terms of positive messages and great role models, that is not a strong point of Control. You play as Jesse Faden as she searches the Bureau for her missing brother, Dylan. On your journey you become the Director of The Oldest House and meet other characters such as Emily Pope, Arish, Helen Marshall, and Ahti the janitor. Jesse is uncomfortable with her role as director at first and slowly comes to the realization that the safety of the outside world is in her hands. Sexual content is nonexistent in Control. Swearing is infrequent and nothing you wouldn't hear in school or even say yourself. There is drug use, in the form of previous Director Zachariah Trench smoking cigars in cutscenes and ashtrays laying around the bureau. There is no consumerism to speak of, as even food in the bureaus vending machines is contained in labeled white bags. There are no advertisements and no merchandise for the game exists as of now. Overall, Control is easily one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. The story is excellently written, gameplay is fun and easy to learn, violence is not too bad, and swearing is fairly minimal. Thank you for reading.
This game is VERY fun and gripping. It is a little on the creepy side and has a few curses in it ut it is not excessive. 10/10
This game is a really awesome game for younger teens who want to play shooter games. There is some frequent use of the f word in the dialogue and remarks but overall this is definitely one of the best third person shooter games or any shooter game for that matter that I have ever played. I highly recommend for mature 11-12 year olds looking for a fun shooter with not too much gore.
it was fun
scientific game with not that much bad stuff
Perfect!
the cycle
the cycle
love cece
The process of loading into a game took while but once you loaed in you would go around looking for contracts, what the contracts are is purple rockes that you have to pick up. The movement in this game was just amazing and the pvp was kinda anouying because everyone would fly up. There was no BLOOD
I think this game is pretty soft except for the shooting all it is just finding resources for scientific research in game so there is a little element of science and its very fun
Has a little violence, but almost nothing else.
It is a really fun game for kids and teens. Some monsters may be scary for young kids but otherwise it is really fun. There are different guns and knives. There is no blood. but lots of violence. it has simple controls and great graphics.

good
great
This is a fun and great game for 13 and up
Spooky!
Kids behave when they are scared!
Okkkkkkkk?
Just like the other maddens
Madden 20
Terrible game but its appropriate for most kids
Come On, it's Madden
Pretty difficult football game with mild language
good game
I gave it an 8 and up because really it all depends on your skill set. Although, if they are really young, turn off chat mixer online because if you're that young and playing online you must have some skills so some people may be cussing you out or just words that little kids don't need to hear.
A very fun game
Madden 20
E A sports
Fun
Great game for NFL Lovers
VERY good game
Engaging football game with lots of opportunities for family fun
This is Ok I guess, Supper star KO: This is pretty fun a little bare and gets old but a lot of room for improvement overall and pretty new,fun,and cool mode. Face of Franchise: This is just horrible in so many ways there is no real choices or story and no mater what you pick you get the same story, once you get to the NFL it just turns into regular franchise mode and you only get to play 1-2 games in college and they are way too easy. Franchise Mode: This is Ok but really is not, there is no motivation or new things that happen so just not motivating Ultimate Team: This is very fun and never really gets old, the only problem is that EA is really just wants your money so baddly. The graphics are ok. - A madden fan
OK game, but way to much micro transactions
this game is really good i say 10 and up because it requires some football concepts
This is a very bad game. Madden for the last few years has been an absolutely horrible game. The game is fine for all ages though. Unless your a sensitive Karen who hates football and thinks its too violent. The only thing you need to make sure is that your credit card is not saved in their Xbox or PS4. Madden has this thing called Ultimate Team where you build up your team with virtual cards that you get from packs which you open with MUT coins. you get MUT coins either by earning them or buying them. If your card is saved they could spend hundreds of dollars. It's a terrible game but it would probably be fun for younger kids. Its just really not for people who want a REAL football experience
This game is age appropriate for the majority of children including younger ones. This does not, however, change the fact that this game is the worst madden ever to come out. The game is buggy, graphically disappointing, and all around worse than any game your child has every played. If they want the game there is nothing wrong with it, per say, but I will warn you that once they have it chances are they won’t want it for much longer.
It's a fun,simple game that doesn'tcause any harm.
I don't understand why some people are saying it's too bad for younger kids. It's just a fun video game. It's not a shooting game, there's not much violence, and most of the modes are easy and fun. There are a few factors that require some understanding of football and the game itself, but it's not that hard. The story mode is very creative and unique, too, and you would think that would really be the only part of the game that is getting these bad reviews, right? Well, yes, but no. This is the main reason people are saying it's not for younger kids, but it's not bad at all! It's actually a very heartwarming story. However, there are some modes that require online play, and once you play someone else and they know your username, they can message you if you're on the same console, and I've gotten some weird stuff from people that I've played online because Madden displays your username when you play online head to head games. And for one of the online modes, Ultimate Team, there are sales, prices, and more sales everywhere! This mode constantly reminds you to spend money on the game, and this is the fastest way to get the best players on your team in this mode. So, your kids may be tempted to buy things on this mode. Also, lots of the songs on the Madden 20 soundtrack include language, but it's pretty discreet. But, it's an overall fun and safe game. So, yeah. Check out Madden 20. It's great!!
The thing that would hold me back the most on buying it is the difficulty. I’m 11 and actually a good video gamer. It’s often difficult for me to play because of the skill level it requires to actually get things done on your account. About language, it’s very mild. Background songs mildly include he*l and da*n. But it will blow over. There is an option to take out the music by pushing R3 and going over to the music icon. There’s a option called QB1 where you start as a college QB and work your way to the nfl and it’s cool. Would recommend.
this game is really competitive, it's really fun and is a good game
it is a fun game but i think at least 9 years old because if they play online they are going to get destroyed no offense
This game is really fun for NFL fans. It lets you play as your favorite team and simulate real football games. There is even a mode called QB1 where you are a college quarterback being drafted into the NFL. The game poses a challenge depending on what skill level you are playing. There is some mild language in the music but it is otherwise a great and very fun game!
its in the game
This is one of my favorite games of all time when I started playing madden 5 years ago and I got sucked in. It is addicted but includes no violence that kids haven’t seen or know about. Although it promotes many teams in companies I don’t consider that to be bad.
This game is amazing but there is mild language in the music
mild language in music
This newest release of Madden is fantastic in so many ways. If you have been a fan of the previous Madden games, this one will not disappoint. The controls and gameplay are very similar - new players have the opportunity to learn basic skills in a practice mode, and an optional run-through of the Pro Bowl when you first start up the game helps introduce players to the mechanics. You can play as your favorite team and run through a typical football season, having the opportunity to take your teams to the playoffs and even the Super Bowl. This is also a multiplayer game, so this game is great for family game nights or parties. There is also an option to create a player and edit the team's uniform, so you can customize your own jerseys or even add yourself into the game. The violence in the game is realistic to football; hits and realistic injuries such as sprains or breaks. Many advertisements to buy players for the Ultimate Team franchise. Overall, a fantastic game for both the young and the old.
