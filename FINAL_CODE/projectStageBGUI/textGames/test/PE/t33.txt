This game focuses on the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It's a pretty good game overall and should be suitable for everybody "five and up". I still cannot understand why it's rated Everybody 10+ and Common Sense Media doing that as well. I never played it, but I watched the ad on Cartoon Network UK. And boxing is not really a violence.

The Coolest Game Ever!
Super Cool But Surprising
Super good, easy and fun.
I was so excited, for this was my first sleepover! That was the first time I played Just Dance (Version 4). Once you start, you can’t stop. Not only is the game Just Dance 2020 worth your time, it also has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is a little high, this game is worth every second of your time. Even though the person dancing on the screen is fake, it looks real. The dancing is smooth and clear, and it doesn’t look like it was animated. The background art is exquisite, and it doesn’t glitch or look pixelated. If you like music and dancing, Just Dance 2020’s song and dances are perfect for you. The song selection is huge, over 400 songs! Although the price of Just Dance 2020’s accessibility is high, once you pay for it, you’ll find that it is worth it. If you come home from a sad day at work or at school, Just Dance 2020 will definitely cheer you up. To spend some time playing Just Dance is worth every second of your time, for it has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is high, the game Just Dance is definitely worth your time.
This game is really fun and can be played by anyone basically.
I really like Just Dance! Some of the songs might have "mature lyrics" but it bleeps it out! Also, there is a solution called "Kids Mode" that can help you with that! I love that I can play video games but still be active at the same time! Epic game overall, I highly recommend it!
Its a good game lets face it yes lyrics can be bad but hey! there is a solution come on! just put kids mode on! Really there is nothing truly bad about this they just put popular songs so you can just dance to your favorite songs! I love it honestly and if you don't want to buy and buy and buy just put just dance videos on youtube and dance for free!
For kids you can have kids mode so it just has kids songs!
Okay, I'd like to point out that the parents are overreacting. I saw some of their reviews, and I think it is partially their fault for not setting boundaries for the songs. Sure, some songs have inappropriate content, sure, it has some moves that parents might not enjoy seeing, but it's their fault for not setting boundaries. And if the kids are 6 or under, they can enjoy kids mode, with totally appropriate content! The curse words are bleeped out, and overall it's a fun experience of exercise and fun all bundled into one! I love this game!
He loves it! We play it as a family a lot and in the UK its rated PEGI 3 so honestly, its not inappropriate. All bad parts are blanked out and these songs are heard on the radio on a daily basis. The naughty parts go over my bros head. If you are mega protective, just play on Kids mode (it has no inappropriate content whatsoever).
This game is amazing and everyone should be able to play it nothing bad shown just dancing!!
AMAZING!!! You can do fun dances and on the website u can reccomend a song to them so that hopefully they add it on the next game! This is one of the best just dance games yet! DEFINITELY recommend this game! Also, it has Billie eilish's bad guy which is an amazing song so u can jam out to that!
My favorite game I love it I have it on my switch and on my Xbox One and not one problem get busy is hard it get I understand but don’t let one song get in the way. I especially love how it blocks out bad words
My grandpa got my family Just Dance 202 for Christmas. It is a excellent game to move your body in a fun way. I just want to play more and more. It is a perfect game for the family. I would recommend this game to family’s.
Good fun excersise
Cool!
This is a good fun exercise game with excellent dances.
Wow for first time I bought JD2019 And I Was Like Don't Stop
I know that the lyrics are a little bit mature but it is great for kids
Just got the game for Christmas and it's the best Just Dance there is! Great songs, so modern and really easy! They have great new features too. So good! Rude lyrics are bleeped out. No "suggestive" dance moves either if you're fussy.
Incredible! I love it!
Fun, but hard!
It's good spooky fun
Very good puzzle game that keeps you going
Luigi's Mansion 3 is a fun, clever, and family friendly game.
A really good game!
Great
Spooky fun
Boo!
It may be scary, but on my opinion it's not. I think some of it's cheery actually. Luigi is very brave fighting all those ghosts.I love how it can be 2 player when you unlock Gooigi. The hotel owner is a bit scary and I find her voice frightening , but apart from that , it's not scary! I watch YouTube Videos about this to get by levels , but I do most of it on my own. It's hard, but it's easy to play so I'd say it's 6 plus.It's so good , but some of the ghosts are impossible to destroy. It took me months to Destroy the Mozart ghost. Hard , but easy to play.
This game is really fun. Great story, and lots of challenging puzzles. Unfortunately, younger kids who get the game are going to have a hard time. The puzzles are quite challenging, and some of the bosses are near impossible. Also, if you have old controllers, it is hard to change into Gooigi. Even at my age, the final bosses are still near impossible. Even though it is hard, this game is still a treasure. The ghosts are not scary, but certain scenes, and the mansion itself has a spooky atmosphere. Have fun playing!
The bosses are fun its not scary AND POLTERPUP IS SO GOSH DARN CUTE
This game has hardly any scariness you can do puzzles that are challenging,hard bosses,and it can take up to 20 hours to beat maybe more if your child isn’t very good at puzzles.Very creative game better than the Luigi’s mansion game cube!
A good solid game my 6 year old brother loves it!
In this game, you must save your friends from a haunted hotel. It's really fun, and only has cartoon violence. It has nothing inappropriate in it, and is fun for the whole family.
The game is scary but it has really good messages and role models.
I really want to play this game. This Christmas am asking for a Nintendo switch and a couple games I hope one of those games are Luigi's mansion 3
Luigi's mansion is a light hearted &amp; funny "horror game". While the game is a direct follow up to the previous entries there not really important besides for some character's and such. There are some occasional jump scares from cartoony green ghosts and the game can be a bit complicated at times but it's still fun. This game adds two player so you can play along side your kid as 'Goo-igi', a luigi made of goo.
Like your video little kids believe in what they see so i agree
Its a good game
A game about Vampires, there's obviously gonna be blood, but in this game you can sort of pick a side between, coming a good or bad vampire (whether you drink from civilians or not). Some scenes can be frightening for young kids that's why I wouldn't recommend under 13's to play this game,
Super Monkey Ball is a blast!!!
H
Super Monkey Ball is a very fun and engaging game!! This game has lots of fun features, especially the “party games” mode which allows you to play tons of fun mini games with the person next to you. This game is lots of fun to play!
The best video game of all time!
I simply cannot put MediEvil into words, due to it being the prime example of what a video game should be. The way it values taking your time and slowly progressing through problem solving and testing strategies. Look no further, MediEvil is the perfect game to introduce video games to your children. Since the game is so complicated, I will have to keep this plot and description here short: The Game is about a soldier who was known to have killed an evil sorcerer named Zarok with his own mighty power, but we find out this man was not the hero we thought. He was a failure to say the least, and had died before he had even gotten close to the sorcerer. He died with a blow to the eye. BUT, many years later, the soldier awakens from the dead to find out that the sorcerer had returned! Originally, Zarok had spawned evil demons in the town, so he did it again from the dead. The soldier now has his chance to stop Zarok and be the true hero he had thought to had been. Now that you are familiar with the plot, you know that the character will be killing demons, zombies and the like, and that is very true. Here is all of the violent stuff that can and will happen: As the soldier, you can slash, crush, bash and ram zombies, demons, imps, scarecrow creatures, and more. When you do this, a very large amount green blood will spurt out on every hit until the monster is dead. You do this on every part in the game, and it it constant. Through the game, you also see blood splattered areas, decapitated bodies, corpses hung on nooses, bodies ripped in half and more. Each one of these things have a fair to large amount of blood. When you kill specific types of creatures, red blood will splatter out into the air, and most will spray onto the walls and pool on the floor. The most frequently killed creatures are rats, which you have to brutally crush with hammers and clubs. This is overly graphic, and they are shown smashed open. Plus, blood is also shown in overwhelming amounts on the ground. Sir Daniel Fortesque rips out guts from his eyehole. There is more violence and blood through out the game, but it isn’t that graphic. OVERALL: The Game isn’t as bad as it seems, and the violence is comical and the premise is silly and fun. The zombies look mostly laughable, and the imps are little Red Devils. This is fine for 8-12 year olds easily!!
Ages 14+
Good game
Only Reliable Review Probably
common sense needs a bit more common sense
God
I have played multiplayer & campaign. And this game is NOT 17+
Mutiplayer is 13+ but Campaign is 15+
Great Game
Great game
I don’t care for the disturbing scenes
war zones the only horrible part
Bravo 6
Great and not 18+
Very well done game!
Very fun game
it is not bad at all
Overall a Solid Game
A brilliant place to start for casual, or new gamers.
Blood knives and guns!
awesome please read
This game gives a realistic overview of the horrors of war with a touching story. The campaign itself is the main reason I am giving it a 14+ due to the storyline of terrorist attacks and youngsters not being able to understand the reality of what is actually going on. Otherwise the multiplayer is 13+ and is just like any other first person shooter with the option to turn of gore.
I think people are crazy when they say the game is for people 18+ the campaign can be a bit brutal but other then that all of the other game modes are fine and you can turn off blood and the language so it is the right maturity of any regular 11+ person
I want to put a reliable review out here from a kid to any parents that wants to get this game for their child. This game is designed to portray modern warfare, hence the title. The campaign is extremely violent, and portrays terrorist attacks and unarmed civilians getting gunned down and blown up. There’s also a scene with a house where you can shoot unarmed people and a infant in a crib if you chose too. I’d say 14 AT LEAST for the campaign. All the kids are on here saying 10 and up are just trying to convince their parents by writing fake reviews. I would’ve done the same. But now that I’m more grown up I understand and respect my parents decisions. It’s extremely dark and violent and deserves the 18 rating. Multiplayer isn’t as bad and only has moderate bloodshed and gore. But there it’s still there. Chances are if you get your kid this game though, they’re going to want to play the campaign, and telling them to not play it’s just going to make them want to play it more. Honestly just hold off and don’t let your kid get it until they’re 14+ if I were you. But I’m not and this might not stop you, but at least you’ll have a reliable review.
I thinks that this is a spectacular game with obvious swearing (its CoD) However if common sense media is going to say that there are NO positive models in this game then I dont know of any game that has positive models in it.
Literally insane. Campaign really do be super realistic doe
Although the campaign is on “sensitive subjects” it’s no worse than the gruesome history of our historical life if not our history is a lot worse! The campaign I would rate for 14+ But multi-player 12+. If you are in middle school this is a liable game, and could even be educational.
Let me start the review off by saying, half of the reviews are wrong, this game is not sutibale for children under 10. At all. The mutiplayer is your standard "gun's blazing" frantic action, its bloody, punch and brutal but if your child is mature and understands the reality of war, do what you think is best. The campaign on the other hand is a grim portrayal of the true horrors of war. One mission has you playing as a young girl trying to escape after a bombing/gas attack of her home, you are forced to kill a soldier and leave your house as troops murder dying people, children under the age of 15 that are not mature will be desensitised to the level of brutality in war.. Some characters are role models in situations that feel real and are concerned about the consequences of their actions (or lack of). Great campaign though.
This game is great. I think the Multiplayer and Special Ops game modes are good for 11+ and the Campaign for 15+.
This game is good for 11 and up as I’m 9 and enjoying this game. You can turn off swearing and gore and blood in settings.
This game is very gritty and hard for me to play casually
war zones the thing I hate because ex fortnite kids are playing this now and ruining call of duty
Bravo 6, going dark
The game is great and u can turn if the gore and language
This game has a really good campaign, the only issue is that its a short campaign. Multiplayer is fun until you get matched with Campers or Sweats. Warzone is fun and much better than any other Battle Royale games on the Market at the moment. Spec Ops ain't any good, every enemy is on the hardest difficulty possible and there ain't any way to change the difficulty. This game does have Micro Transactions in it though, but you don't have to pay to get anything in the game, it's only Weapon Skins, Character Skins, Battle Passes (One time purchase until the season ends.), and that's pretty much it.
The game gives you lots to do in the multiplayer such as grinding for attachments and new guns. The campaign is not for kids and at times can be very bad for kids, there's one part where you are able to see people hanging and a hostage with a bomb attached. Warzone is fine for kids but there is proximity chat, you can turn that off though (I think) How old you should be to play the campaign: 13 - 14 years old Multiplayer: 11 - 13 Warzone: 10 - 12 (that's my opinion and the multiplayer isn't very violent, there is some blood but you can turn that off and it's nothing like the campaign, warzone is just your normal battle royale with some swearing. Blood and swearing can be turned off I believe so that isn't a big deal, campaign is a big no no for kids though and also sorry if I have bad grammar, I am not very good at english)
i started playing cod when i was eight and ever since ive played it almost everyday honestly this game modern warfare is not bad at all ive played gta and all that ive done animalities in mk11 and call of duty isnt even bad
Modern Warfare(2019) is a great addition to the Call of Duty Franchise. The Game is not gory compared to other games in the series. The game however includes images of people being gassed, and has some depressing backstory images(hanging, etc). The one scene that is the worst is where you have to interrogate a terrorist and use his family as leverage/hostages. Besides this it is a game certainly worth playing.
note: I played the campaign all the through just last night, so this is still fresh in my mind. the campaign was gritty, and death was commonplace. this doesn't mean much, as death is common in even games like minecraft. it all depends on how it's delivered. there is blood, which you can turn off. there is dismemberment, which you can turn off. this game paints a picture of a secret war, and is sure to show it's evils. there are hostage situations mid-level in some parts of the game, and depending on how quick the player acts, you can save them. as far as I can tell, there are only about 7 civilian deaths in the entire game, all without blood. this game has mature themes, don't give it to your 8-year-old, but this is a good game to ease people in from either more "Kiddie" games (again, like minecraft) or more peaceful, relaxed games, like animal crossing. in summary, this is a good game, made great by the fact that you can turn down the mature parts of it, to make it a little less heavy-handed. I'd say 13-year-olds could absolutely handle this. hell, I did!
This game has many different modes so you have to know what you're getting in to!. Let's start off with the campaign mode which in a nutshell is pretty much just a playable story (for anyone who doesn't know what a campaign is). Ya, it's gory and violent and should be left for 17+. I'm not going to get into the contents of the campaign but let's Just say it's mature. BUT co-op and multiplayer should be just fine If your kid knows to write and wrong. However, thair is dismemberment but it can be turned off in the settings. As for language as well. When you kill someone they scream and realistically fall to the ground. You do have the option to turn this off by putting the dialogue volume to zero. Overall I don't think that it should be a problem for a 12-year-old to play multiplayer.
the action is over the top and awesome great online nothing suggestive strong language is moderate blood short campaign good story fun to play with friends good messages
