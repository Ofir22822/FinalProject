Overwatch Review
Amazing!
A good starting point
Really like this game, great for kids 8 years old.
Stunning visuals and a diverse cast give this game a nice feel to it.
Worst game ever.
Great game, too many toxic players
Easily the best funnest game have ever played.
lol stolen
This game has some problems for competitive players.
Road to Halo and Battlefield.
Fun game that celebrates diversity
Great!
This is UNDOUBTEDLY a KID FRIENDLY game. While this game has FEW characters wearing MINIMAL revealing clothing and a cowboy character (McCree) smoking, this game's main message is "The World Needs More Heroes" which is extremely positive. The voice chat with strangers may seem dangerous to some, however it is easily turned off. The "sex" of this game being revealing outfits is very minor, is only character design, and can be easily disregarded. While tobacco use can be inappropriate to some the cigar is present to represent McCree's character which is a cowboy. This game also has other options than online with strangers. Players can make their own custom games in which only certain players may have access. If one wishes they could enjoy the game completely with ONLY FRIENDS and no strangers. The violence in this game is present, however is NOT AT ALL GOREY and is not what the focus of the game is. Players have set OBJECTIVES to complete for example, holding/defending an area from the opposite team until the clock runs out or transporting a car from one point to another before the clock runs out. The fact that the video and review do not mention that is an OBJECTIVE based game with violence is disappointing.
Iv'e been playing this game for two years straight now, nearly every single day. I am a tier 400 player which means I have over 300 hrs on the game. Yes, a lot, I know. But my point is that once you start playing you can never stop. It will get you addicted like a cigarette. I have tried to stop many times but eventually I just come back to it. Iv'e read other reviews saying this is a team building game. No, it really isnt. The community is extremely toxic, and you will play games where a teammate is not doing anything and throwing the game meaning your team will lose. Trust me on this, because it isn't fun. Competitive play is the only thing I really play, and it will literally drive you up the wall. This game can make you toxic, depressed and sad, and the thing is, you will keep coming back. Although the game is fun, most of the time you will be screaming at the screen. Competitive play has these things called ranks. Win a game, you go up rating. Losing, means you go down. You can go for weeks and months losing progress and feeling guilty about the fact you went down rating. There is no sense of progress in the game. Furthermore, the game is extremely pointless and sad. There is absolutely no sense of progress whatsoever. So iv'e warned you. The game is cartoony and not violent and all, but mentally, you will be dead inside after your first couple of hours. On a side note, off-competetive is pretty fun with friends, but will definitely get boring after an hour or so. I hope you trust my comment. I have a lot of experience on the game.
No swearing, no sex, a tiny bit of blood, but the game goes so fast you don’t notice it. Great for older kids.
This game is very good with graphics and content. The game communication is a bit on the questionable side because of toxicity but all in all it is a really good game. and also I just want more 8 year old squeakers on the mic because that is always histarical.
Very Good SI-FI violence
Overwatch is an overall good game. Have your child be carefull around three characters, Widowmaker, D.va, and Mercy. Those are the most inappropriate characters in the game. One character, Mccree, is always seen smoking a cigarette. The online interactions are the worst problem. You can turn them off by pressing p in the main menu. It can be hard to play, depending on which character you play as. The majority of the characters are good role models. The plot is is pretty much a group of people come together to defeat the evil robots. The game can be very frustrating at times. There are some splatters of blood sometimes. There are some voice lines that use d*mn. In all, you will be fine as long as you are carefull.
Overwatch is a fun, easy to play first person shooter that allows you to use different heroes to take the opposing team down. Each hero his his or her own abilities and weapons. Some things you should know are: 1. Overwatch DOES have an in-game chat that allows players to communicate with one another. This allows them to come up with strategies, plans, and ideas to win the game. However, there are are many players who use the voice-channel to curse, rant, and attack others. Your child WILL be exposed to harsh language and toxic strangers during the game. 2. Although Overwatch is a shooter, there is minimal blood and the cartoony look makes it perfect for younger children. 3. Overwatch features both genders, though some of the woman are wearing tight, skimpy outfits. In conclusion, if you think your child can handle the toxic voice chat and some skimpy character, this game is perfect for them.
I want to start off this review by explaining why I put ages 13 and up. This is not because of violence! While this game does consist of two teams fighting to the death, the cartoony graphics and lack of blood made me originally rate this game ages 10 and up. However, the reason I put 13+ is due to how challenging this game can be, and how much your teammates rely on you. For a single-player game like minecraft (which does have a multiplayer option, but let's stick with single-player for now) I really don't think it matters how good at the game you are, as long as you're having fun! In Overwatch however, each team consists of six players, which means if one of the people on your team can't really contribute, the other five have a huge disadvantage. That being said, I know there's plenty of 10-12 year olds who are great at fps games, so don't take my age rating too strictly. Like I said, the graphics are cartoony, and there's no blood, so as long as your kid can aim and shoot, it should be fine.
I play this game at my friends house and i like it a lot. it is not that violent and if you are allowing your kids to play games like star wars battlefront etc. , than in my opinion, its o.k. for tweens to play.
This game is fairly violent but good for kids 8 and older. All you do is choose a character and try to take a point and defend or move it to the checkpoint. When doing this, you will try to kill the other team's players.
Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch may be their very best game yet. Its Pixaresque animation style and unique cast of characters are just several of the many wonderful things it has to offer. However, there's some blood and violence, some mild swearing, and one of the characters has a cigar in his mouth at all times. But overall, Overwatch is a treat for tween and teen gamers.
I do think that it is appropriate, just not worth your time. I got the game because everyone said it was good, and it sucked. I think that you could get better FPS games in Star Wars Battlefront or Halo.
The game itself is amazing and one of my favorites. It is extremely fun, and requires strategy and teamwork, unlike other shooters. Sadly, what keeps me from giving this game 5 stars is the community. Too often, players are harassed or made fun of for not playing a hero well. Often this happens in the voice chat, which players can hear even if they're not using it themselves. Its also extremely easy to be exposed to profanity and other language parents may not want their children to hear. If your child can't handle toxic players it is possible to disable voice chat and text chat, though this affects teamwork in a negative way. Overall the game play itself is quite good and if your children can understand cyber bullying, I would fully recommend it. (There is one hero who uses "dammit" infrequently and a huge e-sport tie-in with skins and other in game purchases)
Overwatch is a game taking place in a semi futuristic world following the "Omnic Crisis" in which robot producing factories went rouge and begin to produce massacring monstrosities of robots by themselves. The international unit "Overwatch" was created to quell this crisis. With the crisis over and the organization disbanded, the member's work has just begun. Violence: in gameplay itself, the game lacks any blood and relies on somewhat cartoony art style, still being highly detailed. Language: Because these characters come from different countries in real life, most (minor) swears are in their native tongue, effectively letting them fly over the heads of most players. Some exceptions include the character Reaper who has a selectable voice line "see you in H---!" Sexual content: almost entirely nonexistent. Some character outfits are somewhat skintight yet not revealing. Early in the games release some players complained about a selectable victory pose for a character named Tracer, who some complained "diminished her into a mere sex symbol" due to her back parts being rather glaring. (it was later changed by the game's makers)
This is a first-person shooter in which players join an international task force trying to restore peace to the world. Players use a variety of firearms (e.g., pistols, machine guns), arrows, and futuristic weapons (e.g., laser blasters) to attack enemies in team combat objectives. Combat is frenetic with realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and explosions. Splashes of blood briefly appear with each successful hit. One character is depicted smoking a cigar.
Disclaimer: This is my opinion so don't get triggered from this disagreement. If you get mad when someone thinks different from you I highly suggest that you don't look at this comment. I've played this game for about a year so take what you will from this comment. This comment contains two main points and why I think these things. This whole comment has 746 words so yeah if you don't like reading then you might want to go away. This games Competitive system had some major issues: 1. The players: A lot of players in this game are very... questionable. I put in the game that there was a lot of swearing but not from the game characters... it's the players. With most players you run into a few problems. This game is revolved around it's competitive game mode from the way I see it and anyone that plays a lot this game knows a loss can be very annoying especially if it's because of another player or server issues. Problem A: (Most Common) is: No mics. This one happens quite a bit and for a team game like this, if you don't have communication it can make the game a very terrible experience and can give you a lot of losses. Problem B: (Very Common for me): Throwers/people who lag out. People who lag out throw the game off completely and same with throwers. But this happens to me so much at the point where I can't win because of other players screwing with the game. Also because of the next reason. Problem C: (Very Common) Incompetent Players I don't know what it is with overwatch but it sure has a lot of these. They really make it impossible to win a game reasons like they need to be told when to ult, where to go, ect. even then they don't even join team so you can't help them. Sometimes they get a friend to carry them up to your level or let someone get on there account or someone join team chats and says "This is my brothers account..." and it gets very annoying. This is the cause of a lot of my losses. Problem D: (9/10 this will happen) Toxic Players They just make the game bad to play. All they do is insult the team and say they're doing everything right while your doing everything wrong which will cause a lack of cooperation and can cause people to throw. This can also make you lose your games. 2. Blizzard Blizzard can't keep a server together and does odd things with the game that can really screw it over. Problem A: (Very common/ Not Very Common) Server Problems People that play this game might not understand what I mean at first but just hear me out. (This also is similar to no mics problem.) When a new event comes out it makes the game very difficult to get on because of server problems not as common but can be annoying. But one of the most annoying things that is very common is when you see the error code 10007. This means that for some reason you can't get into voice chat and it is very annoying for all users. I don't know the cause of it is, but I think it's that you can't connect to the voice server. Never the less it's very annoying. Problem B: (Can’t really rate this) The 'nerfs' and 'buffs' Blizzard has a way of when they buff something they make it way to overpowered and just leave it for the whole community to get very annoyed and it's just annoying. The fact that Sombra can hack someone in .65 seconds is enough to prove this point alone. Anyone that plays the game knows what I mean. Problem C: (Most of the time) Placements The ranks are completely broken and when you do the placement matches and win all of them you still can be placed lower than you were in the previous season which is very annoying and should be fixed. To be honest placements shouldn't be in the game for people who have already completed them once because they don't really move that much at all, but they do have a tendency to move people down sr. This is what I think is about Blizzards game Overwatch. Feel free to use this comment in anyway and to tell me what you think of my ideas.
Okay, so overwatch is a super cool game. Some people say it is so violent with blood! Okay, I have not seen blood once in this game, and neither has my friend who has played it for 3 years. Plus, all the guns and stuff are Lazers and sci fi stuff. Except McCree (McCree has an old pistol) Some iffy stuff, there is a character named widow-maker, reaper and when reaper is using his special he yells out: DIE DIE DIE! If you ask me the least violent character is Winston. You need to understand overwatch is an online game with open chat. If you don’t think your kids are ready for that it is up to you. Other than that, I think that overwatch is the road to M games. So the more they play games like overwatch, Star Wars Battlefront and Fortnite, the more they will want to play those games. So beware for asking, can I have titanfall?
Overwatch is very friendly as far as shooters go, there is very little blood and almost no obscene language or drugs (apart from McCree’s cigar) This game is especially important for consumers because it celebrates individuality and diversity with a cast of characters from all different races, countries and backgrounds, as well as a fairly large number of amputees, a canonically gay character and a canonically autistic character, all shown as strong, admirable role models. All in all, Overwatch is a fantastic game for both enjoyable gameplay and vast inclusion. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.
So awesome! Some violence used and some open chat but it's great! IK McCree smokes a cigar but he's a positive character.
