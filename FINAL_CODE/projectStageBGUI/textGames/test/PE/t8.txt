It was ok
This game isn't too bad, but if you are worried about swears then don't let them play.Over all it is a good game.
Not good
An excellent game with quite a lot of mature content
Not as bad as you wold think
Nothing worse than whats on tv
Good for adults and mature teens
Basically Skyrim
this game has things in it. But My 11 year old boy could take it with out me being to conserned. Belive me I am one of the over protective parents (My kids always remind me ) but it is not that bad. The violence is fake and bad
Srry to say its an amazing game but not for under 16 years old.
This game is clearly among the best, but maybe it's also among the best *when you are an adult*. A lot of things are told with a really adult/cold approach. Regarding the 16+ rating, I think some monsters really are gruesome and disturbing. I'm thinking 'The Crones' or the 'Botchling', which are not only visually disgusting but presented in contexts that are intense and maybe cruel. About the sex it all depends how much your kid knows about it. I don't think the sex depicted in the game is too grotesque or offensive, it is quite explicit, a bit cheesy and maybe slightly sexist too. Were it only for the sexual scenes I'd give it a 14+ rating.
This game is great although it does have a good amount of inappropriate content but chances are if your kid is going to middle school they have seen much worse
It has an interesting story with great graphics (providing you computer is good enough). However, this game is not for kids. There are multiple sex scenes and badges for accumulating “experiences”. It isn’t degrading to any characters in the game in any way, but there are bare breasts in the act and plenty of gratuitous scenes.
It's very similar to skyrim. You do what you want and how you want to. You can turn language off and the blood is bad. There is sex in the game but you choose if you engage in it and you are not required to.
Challenging but Rewarding City Builder/Steampunk/Survival Game
Frostpunk (now available on steam)
Violence: Overall grim tone, some text references to death and violence. A handful of still images depict small amounts of blood. | Sex: One building that can be built is a brothel, however, nothing is shown and there's no descriptive dialogue either. | Language: Rare instances of "hell" and "f*ck" in text. | Drugs: Passing references to alcohol.
Game is very kid friendly, could be compared to games such as minecraft (but there are no zombies) You start in the cold off with no shelter no food and many people. Make your own laws such as improving people's lives through making care homes for the physically disabled or even inventing new recipes to feed more people while using less materials. Overall a good game with good challenges and never a boring moment.
Awful
Footballers hook up with prostitutes and when you’re a football manager you don’t have the option to reply to complaints from stupid bitches like me
You missed one
The nightmare for the archer has a steep v-neck woman.
Its Sooo Good!
Way better than the original, which despite its flaws i felt was kinda underrated. The step back to 2D really lets the devs tighten up thier platforming and level design; free of filler content and floaty impreciseness of the open areas/mechanics of the original. Thats all you need. The gameplay may be familiar but the level design is truly unique and absolutely brilliant. If youre gonna imitate, imitate the best; not the soulless AAA machine. No innappropriate content.
Great game
The sex and drugs and swear are not the worst it say the f word 2 times and not any sex from what I’seen my son play the blood is pretty bad thought
I LOVE THIS GAME I AM A BIG BIG FAN OF GHOSTBUSTERS!!!!!!! :D
Best Wii game ever!!!!
very good
Great game if you're not too young.
great 4 a ghostbusters fan!
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!! I HAVE FINALLY BEAT IT ON THE 360 AND I AM NOW PLAYING IT ON XBOX ONE AND I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My daughter Emma, 9, loves this game. She loves the graphics and especially the destroying element. Don't be confused she's a complete girly girl but she loves destroying everything she sees in the game. It was highly fun for all and would absolutely recommend!!!! Especially if you're a Ghostbusters fan like we are!!!!
no language at all violence isnt bad no blood u cant even die u just fall down its perfect ecsept the part were ure in the library u hear noises that scare u like screaming and kids talking
This game is a must have for any Ghostbusters fan... however I will address the one concern I have for kids and tweens. I think you should be at least 13 to play this because there are some scenes in the game that are just down right scary. I mean... it's not F.E.A.R scary or Deadspace scary but it's scary. For example you go to the hotel Sedgwick and have to get this ghost of a "Spider Witch". She had been a serial killer from the '20s who murdered men she brought up to her room. That kinda freaked me out as I have a fear of spiders... lol. And there is some frightening (if sometimes humorous) dialogue and scenes in that part. Overall... if you're kid is 13 and likes Ghostbusters (and can say "I ain't 'fraid of no ghost" and mean it... it's for him/her.
Online is amazing! game is overall 9.5!
A great game for kids ages 8+! The violence in this game is not going to be a major influence noting that the weapons are sci-fi ghost guns!
Low Effort Money Grubbing Trash.
Good game for mature teens
They say “God-d*mn” in the first couple of minutes
Not as bad as people make it out to be
O.K.
Very good game a few ideas that would maybe put at a perfect level
Worst in series
This game was an honest total waste of cash
Amusing
Good Game
NOT THAT BAD
Meh
Bad game
Its shocking that after all the goodwill Ubi built with Seige, Wildlands, and Division 2 they excrete this! Embarassing AI, non existant immersion, bugs out the wazoo, empty world with the dumbest copy paste content imaginable, a non stop parade of dumb gimmicks including "survival mechanics" that do not fit the action oriented game design copy pasted from Wildlands (you need to wait and refill stamina to CLIMB 2 FEET). I liked Wildlands but even that was no master class; but this trash makes that game look like Witcher 3. Top it off with idiotic psuedo RPG mechanics that serve no purpose but to monetize the hell out of the game and further break the "tAcTiCaL" illusion with bullet sponge drones that add nothing to level design.
As a father of a 11 and 14 year old children at first I was uncertain to buy them their first MA-15+ game. My wife and I had a chat about it and we decided I should play it first. I instantly got drawn into the enjoyable multiplayer. I do believe that it is appropriate for my children. Now your child would be exposed to gun violence, but no consumption of illegal products, in other games like call of duty. Similarly it has little too no swearing and only one character swears. It promotes There is blood but your child has most likely seen it in a movie or TV show. There some people on voice chat can be harsh and rude but that feature can be turned off. As long as you child know the rights and wrongs they should be fine.
I really love the gameplay and multiplayer open world action of Ubisoft games, but it seems like the feel the need to use God’s name in vein in every game nowadays - why? Would the game be less appealing if they did’t say “GD” so much? I just got FarCry 5 and they said it in the first couple of minutes and then throughout the game - same thing with Ghost Recon Breakpoint, they said it immediately in the first few minutes and then throughout the game. Also with Ghost Recon Wildlands (which to me was the best game of all time) by why does it make the game any better to say GD all the time - makes me cringe every time and for anyone who has had their lives changed and saved by God, I would think they would feel the same way. I seriously think I have to stop supporting Ubisoft for this reason, their games are good, but my God is great!!
This game is okay for 10+ because the only real reason it should be higher is the bad language, but you can turn that off in the settings. The only other thing is the violence which certainly isn't as bad as other games where blood and organs explode from a person when they die. The only real point where the violence can be a bit extreme is where players have an option to stab an enemy multiple times in the back - even after they have clearly died - or snapping their neck. I have watched my 11 year old son play this and it's honestly not as bad as alot of the reviews say, most games are okay for kids once they have reached 11 or 12.
I let my son play this game because its not as gory as other games and their are no drug references.
This is a good game in my opinion from graphics to weapons , the story line everything a few ideas i have though would be that 1 this game definitely should develop cross play on all platforms of gaming I mean I know that nowadays a lot of games have crossplay but I have other friends that have the game but different systems really think it would put this game at the top next too fortnight, gta, C.O.D etc
I have only played the last three games in the series and this one was the worst by far. Like lots of new Ubisoft titles, they are drifting away from good games to profitable games. The "survival" is a lie, it is the same as most modern FPSs, the newly implements gear level system (similar to that of Destiny) is bad, it is nothing like any other ghost recon game(for the ghost recon series, originality in the story is good but gameplay is best left as is from previous games.) Don't waste your money in this just get Wildlands. As for parental stuff, lots killing, medium amounts of blood, lots of swearing, but encourages team work and helping those that can't help themselves
Ironically, after the five star "expert review", Breakpoint falls so short of expectations, you shouldn't even bother with it. Forget the violence, you'll just be wasting your money.
In this game you are a Soldier and you are going to stop terrorists. It’s violent, but most of the game you are not shooting people, you are shooting robots.
Some Language, violence, but not very gory
Ghost Recon: Breakpoint takes away the fun that was in Wildlands. If you prefer a solo gameplay then don’t get this game, because it is nearly impossible to complete any tasks outside of story missions.
The camera angle in the game is absolutely atrocious. The sense of the game's theme is just bad. Too many glitches in the game and it takes way to long to travel from one place to another.
Rehashed content, underwhelming and short.
Good, but not great DLC has more intensity; some heretic elements may not be for children.
Fantastic Symbolism and Story Aspects
For a 40 dollar price tag, this is a very short and boring entry, especially for those who have played Destiny 1. For the few that will actually play the raid and fractions that will complete it, this is another raid of mechanic heavy waves of the same adds with a reskinned oversized boss at the end. You will be required to know your specific role and learn the mechanics as the encounters in the raid are more about doing specific tasks in sequence without dying rather than engaging an epic boss and surviving his attack patterns . The formula is predictable and bland with little to offer for single players. For the most part, this is more content to play the same thing multiple times to level up to do the same stuff over on a harder level or for the new raid itself, New Light players who are new to the game may find it packed with content, but not much for those already invested. The big sell is the new gear system, but aside from these "tweaks", nothing here is changing the game in huge ways. With endless materials and trinkets to obtain for hours and days worth of game play, anyone who doesn't dump a crazy amount of time in will find much of it overwhelming and often futile as rewards verses time spent is bent towards the obsessive couch potato. This entry is not worth the price tag, but hardcore fans will love it just being more Destiny. I was once, and still know people, who play this game for hours a day. THAT is the audience this game wants to keep happy as they spend alot on DLC and the most obsessed spend oodles on cosmetics and loot as 1/3 of Bungies revenue is derived from extras alone. And be sure we will be doing this now every 3 to 4 months from now on. This game is a formula now that will probably stay on course for years to come. For me....no thanks.
Ok before I start Im gonna include everything in Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is an online shooter that promotes teamwork and avenging our race. Violence wise, this game has intense first-person combat that promotes killing aliens and robots using a variety of weapons including pistols, auto rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, fusion rifles-high caliber weapons that fires a burst of energy-rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and swords as well as a range of magical abilities that can injure and even disintegrate enemies. Also, some of the weapons are called "exotics" which do special things, for example, the hand cannon Crimson's exotic perk allows you to gain health upon killing enemies, and it's default appearance contains blood on it. Any other blood appearing from the player is smeared on the screen. Players may also go against other players in many modes in the Crucible. Also, the review for the blood is all wrong. When you precision shot a Cabal soldier, a mixture of oil and gas spurts out, not blood. With the introduction of the Scorn in Forsaken, precision shots first explode their head, and if you look at their dead body they look very disturbing. Sexual content wise, there is a Crimson Days event that allows you and your "partner" to go against another pair of lovers and defeat them, and Lord Shaxx's dialogue may be mildly inappropriate. Other than that, no sexual themes. Language wise, there is a couple hell's, some damn's, one rumor of an a**hole, and *spoilers* when Cayde 6 dies, Ikora says "We will mount the head of that son of a bitch on his throne," other than that, the only other language is through the enabled chat. Consumerism wise, there is a heap of Destiny 2 merchandising on it's website, and on others as well. Players may also experience hackers in PVP, and it may be very annoying. No drugs, but Cayde mentions some drinks.
Absolutely fantastic game even if the storyline is short but it keeps you on suspense until the other dlc's drop, and the symbolism of Eris, who has PTSD is amazingly portrayed well and respected.
