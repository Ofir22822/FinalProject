Awesome game
A good game, not for young kids but fine for 10 and up
Excellent game for a mature audience
Masterpiece of a game, truly incredible.
I think red dead redemption is a lot of fun.there is some gore,drinking,swearing,and sex but if your kid is over 13 they probably know all that.this game is definitely not as bad as gta when it comes to sex scenes there really only one in the bar in the mission a quiet time. Gore is not terrible but it’s very realistic you can shoot peoples limbs of but them on train tracks and stuff but it’s not bad.there’s another scene where a guy comes in on a horse holding his head but you can skip the cutscene.I think red dead is a great game and would recommend it if your 13 or older
So I would recommend it for 10 and up parents normally know rockstar for adding nudity and most of their games being rated M into a game but Rdr2 does have a little but not too much and it is only in the missions it is not as insane as Gta I think it would be ok for kids to play this and Im saying 10 and up for the guns and violence and they dont say millions of bad words and most of them are just shit and bastard still it is a good game and they dont curse too much so it is an amazing game just dont let your kids play the mission
This game does contain occasional swearing and limited nudity while players may do bad things he also helps people that are being hurt,sexually asullted,and victims to racism. Honestly my 14 year old son loves the game because it’s a fun and creative entertaining game. I say if your kid is around the age of 13-15 he will be fine as long as he is matured.
Hello, I think that 11+ is a good age to play RDR2, it does have a lot of swears, but n word is only used once it the story, there is good role models (kinda) the good role models would be Arthur, Lenny, Sadie, Charles, John, and Hosea. There are moments around camp where you can hear Ms. Grimshaw call some of the women whores, and Micah is blatantly racist, Micah picks on everyone except Dutch, There is also a mission where you can stumble across two people having sex, but that’s only if you go into that room, in that same mission you have to get drunk. Also Bill is an alcoholic, other than some of the language I think it’s okay.
I think this game is fine but it is a bit violent Would recommend 11 and up is fine but it depend on your child
First off, this game isn't for youngsters. I know there are a lot of people on CSM claiming to be adults and giving it 10+ ratings, but that is false. First off, the major thing is that RDR2 is a violent, chaotic, western romp with plenty of mature content. Characters can be shot, stabbed, run over, choked, punched, kicked, blown up, drowned, and tortured. While it has guns, it doesn't feature modern-day guns like in other shooters, but things like Colts and other Wild West guns. Violence, blood, and gore is quite common in the game, with the ability to kill anyone given to you from day one. While killing is possible, you will get a bounty for doing so and your in-game rating, "Honor", will decrease. Even if you do kill, the bounty system reinforces punishments for crimes and makes you pay for killing. The characters also clearly feel remorse for their actions, as they commit pretty terrible things, but it is never revered and it makes it clear what you are doing is wrong. While sexual themes are there, sex isn't and risque images are pretty much the extent of it. Violence and drinking are omnipresent, with several instances of coarse language and drinking, but the drinking and smoking is present in every wild west movie, tv show, or book. Overall, it is a good game with morals, a clear knowledge of the impacts of your actions, and an immersive story. And while it does not really fit, you can pet dogs in the game!
Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the very few games that I would call a masterpiece. Everything about it - from the stunning graphics to the intriguing character development - is incredible. It's extremely immersive too - (SPOILER ALERT) when one of my favourite characters died, I genuinely felt upset and angry towards the people that killed him. This is down to the amazing work of the voice actors, writers and animators that make the world so stunningly realistic that you feel like you are actually a part of it. In addition, the gigantic open world and countless side quests means that even once you have finished the main story, there is still lots to do. The online mode isn't as good as the main game - there are a few glitches and it's less realistic - but it's still good fun. Red Dead Redemption 2 gets a perfect 10/10 from me.
So I’ve seen plenty of other reviews saying this game is appropriate for kids as young as 10, but they clearly haven’t seen the sexual, graphic and generally inappropriate scenes. Most of those things are stumbled upon by chance and you won’t see on every play through, though none are inherently ‘bad’, just not appropriate for younger players. Other than that the graphics are fantastic, the story moving and the characters beautifully thought out. Definitely recommend for mature gamers :)
I think the is game is a good and entwining game for kids and there parents. There is an open world to have fun and explore. The cursing in the game is the cursing you’d expect in a movie rated 12 the worst word is the f word and even that is said rarely the is also NO SEXUAL ACTIVITY
It is a great game with positive messages and not too much violence. I recommend this heavily to any kid age 11 and up.
This is an amazing adventure game! There is some swearing, but it is not frequent. Arthur might not be a good role model, but at least he is trying to repent. The online mode is very fun too, but people can swear in the chat. Great game for tweens!
Red Dead is a powerful story about the end of the old west and the beginning of a new era of industrialization, and civilization. The player character, Arthur Morgan, is a strong and three dimensional character, frequently doing terrible things to protect his family and friends. He has a strong moral compass but does the dirty work too. The game is centered around the life of an outlaw gang which lives by stealing from the rich and powerful. I'm 18 years old and I am squeamish to violence, but there have been two times I have been rather disturbed by events and things in the game. You can find an eviscerated corpse torn apart and strung below a bridge, left by a serial killer. In one mandatory mission a rival gang decapitates and horribly mutilates a friend of Arthur's. Otherwise the violence is not excessive for the subject matter. However I would not recommend this game to anyone who strongly dislikes gore and younger teens. The game is one of the best I've played because of it's strong story and emotional impact as well as it's fun and immersive gameplay.
My son started playing red dead a year ago and ever since my son wanted to know more about the old west he’s been playing red dead redemption. It’s a great game but it depends on the parent. There is a little swearing but my son hears that everyday so my review Is that it is the best game for ten year olds.
That game is really damn awesome and i recommend it a lot. Parents, don’t make your childrens missing out that beautiful masterpiece. A beautiful scenario, graphics, and so on. So far a very good game!
This is a fun open world game some say this should be rated 17+ because it has Nudity and Swearing and I'm pretty sure 11 year olds cuss and hear cuss words everyday so the swearing is not bad the Nudity is just them taking the skins of animals so they can eat
This amazing game has loads of content but might be to violent for kids but, if your kid has played games like minecraft they wouldn't blink at this because it is the same concept. Unless your kid is immature, they can probably play it
Excellent game, however extremely graphic, realistic bloody violence throughout. Has dismembering as well as graphic nudity. Very foul language as well. Very well written story mode and online is getting better as the days pass. If your child is mature enough to handle I'd let them play it. I'd only let a little one play to ride around on a horse for a bit and nothing more as you can go on full killing sprees on innocent people.
Rockstar Games hit a grand slam with Red Dead Redemption II. This game is Rockstar best game yet plus Rockstar eased off on the sex and drugs sine GTA V. I will say there are some references the prostitution and Jim Crow but the violence is fine for any sort of mature kid and the protagonists are great role models.

Before Saying No To Your Kid Read This!
Great game
Not what you'd think.
My Thoughts
Amazing game!
Red dead redemption 2 is a fabulous game. The rating of this game is r16 but really is fine for anyone kid around the age of 12. Firstly red dead 2 is an amazing story and it's not all about violence and isn't gory by any means. This game has minimal swearing, a bit of violence mainly because of the hunting and no way should be rated r16. I let my son who just turned 13, who has been begging me to play this game. I looked at some gameplay of read dead 2 and I realized this 60+ hour game is for sure fine for most 12 year old kids to play. Even rockstar, the producers them self said this game was more eligible for kids then there other games. Coming from a Mom my self I would say to all the other Moms who's sons are looking to get this game it is really not as bad as people say and should be fine for your 12+ kids to play.
its an amazing game. the violence is fine its just like any other shooter. the only gore I found was in a few side quest and a few main quest. you can also blow the limbs of people but that's only with a shot gun or you shot them several times with any other gun. and you can set people on fire. the only sexual themes I remember is when Arthur is gets super drunk and tries to find Lenny and walks into a room there is a naked woman on top of a man but she covers her boobs. and you can find a man who lived with wolfs that shows a penis, the n word is only said once and other words are what you here all the time. if your going for a peaceful playthrough what's the point of playing the game because how are you going to get through the story or anything. in Rhoads at night time you can find a kkk meeting . I don't want to spoil the story because its good and I highly recommend this game to any over 13 because its a master piece.
I'm gonna be straight up here this games is quite violent, there is so much choice in how to kill people but it's just choice . The stories violence at worst gets to Buring people alive (messed up ik) but only bad people are killed like that and it's not extremely graphic. Secondly. Adult themes, this game is not short of racism, sexism and more, but it is not supported. Your kid might not even pick up the racism or masogony. You will hear the N word about 3 times at most, but it is only said by one character (Lenny) and you can find the KKK but they are shown as being stupid so yeah. Thirdly. Nudity and sex, there is zero nudity but sex is talked about on acasion, but it's no more than on the office. You can find prostitutes but cannot hire or do anything with them, and you can get bathed by a woman but it is not sexual. Lastly. Language, swearing is very common but no more than a 12 year old says around his friends, and it isn't really used offensively. F**K is used a fair bit but mostly in anger or by one Irish character (Sean) and Sh*t is used very often but lots of the time in anger or to literally describe horse poop. So in reality just see how your kid stands on racism, woman's rights and what they want to do in the game. If your kid just wants a good story and a fun open world it should be fine.
The language didn't need to be so bad. This game rocks otherwise. Someone said the "f" word and "s" word were the worst, but c---s----- is frequently used too.
This game is pure amazing and a work of art, but it is very violent, has sex acts, drug use, drinking/getting drunk, and lots of swearing. It is still a very good game and I highly recommend it.
I used to work at PEGI and they are extremely strict there for example when this game first came out I voted it to be 12+ Same as Mortal Kombat 11 and also many other games I have voted in (COD MWF I voted 12 same as BO4. For COD WW2 u voted 16 as it was the world war. But anyway this game is only ok if your child is sensible and you have brought them up well. If you have done this and know it well and truly then that is not just it. If your child gets carried away and acts out characters in games and people in movies this game is not for them unless you teach them not to. This is simply because of the violence in the game and they would of cause act it out in real life and possibly do it on the friends and others in real life.
im scared for life
If your kid wants an accurate simulation of 1899 then buy them this game
this game is rated m because of a lot of things, the violence is why i rate it twelve and up. their is blood splash and lots of shooting. but if your child is a mature... for a 12 yr old than by all means, let them get this game.

I think its a great game i have watched some of it while my son was playing. there is a small bit of swearing but a kid or person 12 and up should now not to repeat it and has probably already heard it. its a great game about the wild west and cowboys. Overall a great game with 1 or 2 f words.
Children above nine should be able to play this game it is not very bad, there is little to no cussing and there is guns and it is nothing different to call of duty. It should be a teen rated game.(This is way more kid friendly than the first red dead redemption) I have beat the game and there is no NUDITY in the game at all.
Can I begin with saying this game is stunning. Truly incredible and if you haven’t experienced this game for yourself then I definitely recommend you do. Now, I have played through the entirety of the story mode in this game and explored the map. I have got over 200 hours on this game, and being a strict parent myself wouldn’t usually let my kids play M rated games. I do not let them play games like call of duty, gta etc. In this game, there is absolutely no nudity, some of the main issues I had was swearing and violence. The violence is bad, there is detailed blood and you can see blood splatter on the floor when your shoot someone. Throughout the story mode, there is Arthur (the main protagonist) whom commits multiple crimes at the beginning. Moving through the story, however, players get to see Arthur feel guilt from his bad actions, as well as this the game punishes players with a bounty if they commit crimes. In the world, you will occasionally see hangings taking place, but it is by no means detailed and the player can save them. One mission requires you to save Arthur’s friend from hanging. This game is by not meant to be taken seriously, the gameplay is funny and I’m constantly getting sidetracked from the story and doing other things. The thing I was most worried about my kids seeing were the prostitutes in the city, but the truth is they just look like normal women and the only thing that makes them prostitutes is the dialogue, they will occasionally dialogue some may see as inappropriate. This is all just dialogue and there is no way to interact with them whatsoever, it is not even clear they are prostitutes at first. In the open world the player can choose to drink alcohol or smoke cigars, during cutscenes you can often see characters smoking. My final point is that if you child is a teen, LET THEM PLAY. Arthur is a great role model who helps people, does jobs for people and works to serve justice. If your child is any younger than 12, however, I would still let your child play but there may be certain parts that they don’t understand, as well as this the language can get quite bad at times (not the N-word like common sense included in their own review for some reason) and contains words like the sh*t, p*ss, b*stard and the f-bomb is dropped as well but not as often as other M rated titles.
It’s fun and not that bad.
One thing a lot of people say after finishing this game is "I learned so much from a man who never existed." A few missions require you kill innocent people, but while you are exploring the open sandbox western United States, you don't have to cause any harm to anyone (except lawmen, rival gang members, and other enemies trying to kill you.) There is some "bad language use" but you can hardly hear it. The gang leader is set on getting money to flee the country, so you are forced to rob stagecoaches and banks. During one mission, you get drunk and do... things. Characters are also seen smoking every few cut scenes. On one side-quest, you are walking through an art gallery and there are paintings of nude people. If your child has been to a art museum, it will be nothing. The game is very well done and I very much enjoyed it.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a new game released by Rockstar (who also made GTA). However compared to previous Rockstar games this is a baby. There is little to no nudity and the language is toned down quite a bit. This still contains violence and offensive language but this should not be new to anyone who has played other R16 games ( Assassin's Creed, Halo, Call of Duty ...) This game is stunning and everyone should have a chance to experience it. This should not be an R16 game! Thank you for reading this and I hope this provides useful details. Paul/GameRater
It’s really fun I have seen my son play it and I’ve played it myself, it’s great for kids 8+ Other parents are to over protective.
It has some of everything. For people that are coming for questions about rape/sexuality in the game, there is none. I've played through it, it's not bad. There are two scenes in question here. One where a woman asks to bathe you. Even if you accept this offer, nothing is shown. Very clean there. The second; If you make your way to a swamp area, you may encounter another man who hits you. You wake up in his bed tied up, nothing shown there either. Not too clean, but fine if your child understands. Next, swearing. Mild swearing. I feel reviews are exaggerated on this topic. If your child knows the words, they'll be fine. Mostly words like b**ch, or ba**ard. It has an amazing storyline. You can play for hours and never get bored. Graphics are amazing. If your child may understand some of those topics, the game might be perfect for you.
Hi, other parents, I bought this game for my son and had my husband play it first to see what he thought. He thoroughly enjoyed it and said my son could play it. It has some bad words but all tweens know these words by know and it has small snippets of sex talk but the main character does bad things everyone in the west did but he sticks up for what he believes in and it has made my son more confident and a stronger young man.
I absolutely loved this game and think it would be fine for your 10 year old to play!
