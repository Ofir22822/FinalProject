Very good.
Moving and Engaging
Entertaining, Educational, and Emotional!!!
Wise and interesting game. A lot of emotions and a lot of historical knowledge.
Was looking for a non-shooter game for Xbox One for my 11-year-old son, who tends to be interested in history. This was just right. The challenges and story are keep him engaged and even his older sister, who isn't really into history, wants to play. Unlike many games, it is fun for the whole family to sit and watch and talk about, so it is a way to spend time together while still allowing video game time.
Absolutely a fantastic game! It's a great way to learn more about World War l and to test your puzzle skills! It is also very touching as the story of the characters you play as continue with the game. Some may even cry at some moments (Yeah, it's that touching; even I cried at some moments!). Altogether, this game is definitely a must-have for everyone!
Amazing
How can I switch to different weapon while I’m in a match in bullet force on freegames66?
Great concept utterly fails in execution.
Racing on ceilings and walls sounds fun, until you actually do it. Literally everything feels off and clunky and the steering has no oomph to it it feels like your steering a hoverboard with static stop and go and no drifting...and it's simply just NOT FUN to play or drive. The gripping itself on vertical surfaces and ceilings is finnicky and illogical with the physics of it all being confusing as you become dislodged or unable to race as you want many times. This just adds to the tedium and frustration of the other uninspiring elements of the game. I long for the days of demos again as this is the 3rd or 4rth racer that has been very sub par that I purchased without trying first. This just truly fails to be fun on any level.
Violent
Best Game
Gory fantasy violence
It's rated for m 17+ and don't let under 17 play
nice game,me and my friend are playing it right now!!! bad ice cream 3 on hudgames is the best game
Good action RPG, almost up to the standard of it's incredibly good predecessors. There is plenty of violence here, but it is all fantasy violence in a non-too-realistic style.
Hokuto no ken fans need this game
You're wrong about the positive role model thing.
The game gives a good role model (though I think this may be unintentional). For long time fans, this game is great. The battles are satisfying and fun. The game can even be fun if you have never read the manga or watched the anime. Kenshiro is a good role model and what he does in the game can teach a lesson (not killing the bad as a lesson but trying to do the right thing) However him being a good role model is something some people may thing and others wont. Overall: fun and great over the top gameplay mixed with a storyline.
Kenshiro is a good role model and of course he has to kill because its set in a post apocalyptic world. He only kills evil people and protects innocent people (heck he even gives them food and water when they are about to starve or die from thirst). Just because a character fights evil doers does not make him a bad role model. Also the post apocalyptic theme like others with that theme don't have that much law so of course the hero has to kill the baddies to protect the innocent. Also if you keep criticizing the heroes fighting bad guys you're going to make your self look like a villain apologist.
My kid had this game 7/10
My son bought this game it looks ok to me every now and then there are damn you and sh**t every hour in the game but other wise it is ok for 10 to 12 year old kids to play I hope this helps your disigin on this game
Not as bad as you think
The violence has almost no blood at all.
GREAT FOR ANY FAN OF THE ANIME/MANGA!
The game is only rated T (For teen) because of the language (the words sh*t and a**hole are sometimes said) the violence is about 5/10 there is mild blood but its to over the top to be taken seriously by anyone over the age of 10 and as for sex the character Momo Yaoyorozu has large breasts and her costume shows cleavage and another female character Himiko Toga has a short skirt but any kid who has seen Sailor Moon should be fine with that. So this game is good for anyone 12+
This shouldn’t be an 18 rated game.
Other Reviews Are Over Dramatic!
Red Dead Redemption 2 Is a great game that any parent should allow their kid to play!
For kids 12 and older
New update attends to younger players
Lots of gore and mature themes.
So glad this update is coming to the amazing world of red dead redemption 2
SO GLAD THERE IS A CHILDRENS MODE SOON
Amazing depth!
It’s fine
Too much nudity?
Fantastic Open World adventure, has gory violence.
Only allow your kid to play if they are willing to stay on the side of good honor.
Great Game
Great for anger
Red Dead Redemption - A Masterpiece
amazing
Amazing for Kids and Adults
AMAZING BUT GRAPHIC
First of all I think this game is fantastic, and would be a shame for people 13 and over to miss out on. I pre ordered it for myself as I loved the first one, my son who is 13 found out and was begging me to let him play when it was released but I said no. I said that as I didn’t know how the game was gonna be like but I have now played it so I shall give a review on it. Let’s talk about language first. The language in this game is quite good for an 18 rated game what I mean is that there is swearing every single second. The worst the language gets is a few F words, I have played a lot of the game and haven’t heard the N-word so not sure why common sense put that in their rating. The S-word is said a bit but if your child is over 13 they would have heard it a lot at school and in films anyway. The most frequent word you will hear is b*stard and b*tch but even these don’t occur a lot. Now onto the violence, the violence in this is nothing more than you will see in shooters like Call Of Duty when a person gets shot there will be some blood spray but this would be expected in a game where guns are involved. There is no gore unless the player chooses to do so, for example you can tie someone on train tracks and wait for the train to come and that is gorey bit the only other gore is if you purposely go up to someone and shoot them point blank in the head but if your child doesn’t do this then they won’t see any gore. Sex and nudity is almost not in the game at all although there is a scene with a women on top of a man but it is split second and you don’t have to go there other than this there is none at all. Drinking and smoking is present but if your child is mature it won’t affect them. NOTE: there is a bit of hunting but you don’t have to do it. Overall I think you should let children 13 and over that are mature play. I have let my son play. Hopefully this helped you thanks Micheal
First off, the other reviewers overly dramatize their reviews. The swearing is there, but it's no more than a PG-13 movie. Even so, you tend not to notice it as you're too busy taking care of your horse, eating, or fending off foes. Next topic is sexual themes. Throughout my whole game play, I only encountered one sexual theme/reference. And, that was a girl requesting to wash me in the bathtub. You are easily able to decline this, and even if you do accept nothing is shown. She is still a fully dressed woman. Overall, this game is incredible and hands down game of the year. I rarely let my 14-year old even watch PG-13 movies, but this game he just has to experience. You can either be a good outlaw, or a bad outlaw, and that choice is up to you. At the end, the story leads you in a way that makes you feel bad if you're a bad outlaw and teaches you to be a good respectable citizen. Again, it's just a fantastic story. If you, or your kid, has the money to purchase this game then I highly recommend it. Thanks for your time, - Trusted Parent Reviews.
Red Dead Redemption 2 Is a fabulous game. I, myself have played it for about 45 hours. Recently, my child asked if he could play the game. I said sure. He's only 12 and we played together for 2 hours. He enjoyed it extremely much and asked if I could buy it for him. I said yes because, I've played it for over 45 hours and I am excited to let you know that this game is perfect. The game is rated M, and it is rated this for language, violence, and nudity. I want to let you know that the violence in this game is low to none. When you shoot someone, small puffs of blood come out of the enemy. But, it is not overly graphic. There is no gore, or at least I haven't seen any so far, and language is in there. The language is definitely the biggest factor for rating this game M but, even that is hard to find. The main character curses using the words S**t and B***h once or twice every 15-25 minutes. This is extremely low for a M rated game. Also, the F word is used three times in the entire game so far. These times were only in the story mode/campaign and they were from the Irish. The Irish are not a main part of the story and can be bypassed if wanted. That's it for language. For nudity, there is only one thing: horse genitalia. Horses have these, but they are only found it you are deliberately looking for them, you would have to kill your own horse so that it falls over and then you would have to get a weapon with a scope to see them. They are invisible to the naked eye. That's pretty much it aside from one scene in the entire story where you can go and purchase a deluxe bath for a large portion of money. The deluxe bath has no more gains to it from the regular bath except for a lady, fully clothed, comes in and bathes you. No nudity is shown, not even for a second and only one time does she put her hand deep into the water and bring it up to wash your arm. It looks as if had she might be washing your character's unmentionables but, it was confirmed by the director of the game that she is just getting her hand wet to wash off the mud off your arm. Finally, that's it. I will update this review if I find anything else that is not family-friendly but, right now I can't find anything that isn't. Thanks for spending the time to read this and I would definitely recommend buying this for your child if they are into the old West. Thanks again and have a good day!
This game has blood language but any mature 12 year old should know this language and not be affected. There is partial nudity for like a second in the whole game.
I am so glad to say that red dead redemption 2 is coming out with a setting to turn off the very little blood that is shown even before you turn on the setting. Also the cursing is muted. Also this will be available on may 15 2020. Thank you rockstars.
First of all, RDR2 is a great game, with an immensely interesting and immersive story, but, very graphic. Some reasons why I recommend RDR2 for kids 15 and up, would be because of lots of gore, language, and mature themes. For example, people can be shot, stabbed, lassoed, mutilated, dismembered, Etc. Characters will have frequent conversations with mature themes, such as sex and alchohol. Also, People at the saloons will drink, and it will often cause them to blackout, your character can drink, and others too. There is lots of swearing, with people constantly using the F-word, and B-word. Finally, consumerism is present in this title, you can buy gold bars with real money, and money in-game. These are a few reasons why I think RDR2 is for kids 15 and up.
I am so glad that Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting a content restriction setting in this beautiful game. Red Dead has become free in the Xbox games pass. And Xbox has a special rule that kids should be able to play all the game on there game pass for maximum profit. Once you load into Red Dead Redemption 2 you pick if you want to play online or story mode, Story mode is a bit more mature but with this update both are child friendly now. Thank you Red Dead for putting this in your amazing game so younger gamers can play this award winning game.So if your kid was begging for this game then you don’t need to be pestered anymore.
I am glad there will be a children’s mode released on may 15
I agree with Common Sense Media’s rating suggesting that adults only play this game. So far, I have played for a few hours and made it out of the snow to the campsite. I find it surprising that the “parents” on CSM are suggesting younger ages than the kids are. What I have seen and heard so far is not excessive as some mature rated titles are (such as the new Doom games), but it is still appropriate for the mature rating it has received. Violence and gore: So far, I have seen several shootouts, a fist fight, a dead horse on the ground with its guts sprawled into the snow and urine underneath it, and a decapitated body strung up underneath some train tracks with blood dripping from the body, and guts on the ground. To the side of the lower half of the body is also a head of the character that is pinned against the wooden post with some form of stake and a paper inserted into its mouth. A lot of the violence is what can be seen in some Teen rated games, such as the Uncharted series, but there are occasional scenes that are more graphic, such as the slow motion deaths that show realistic detail of where the person was shot with blood splattering through the air. You can also drive a knife into your enemies to kill them. Depending on your actions, they could be cold-hearted killings or self preservation. There is one moment in the game where you can kick a man who is hogtied on the ground. There is another where you have a choice of how to deal with a man who you got into a fistfight with. I don’t remember the choices, but there is a more harsh and a more kind option to choose from. Language: The language in the game is appropriate for the situation. Again, it is not gratuitous. There are periods of time where there is no language at all, and there are other periods where I have heard language that would be heard in a Teen game as well. There is a character in a saloon who talks about a pig’s anatomy and I’ve heard one F-word in the few hours of gameplay that I’ve been through. Sex/Nudity: So far, there has not been any nudity or sexual content, besides a female character walking around in the background of camp with a low-cut top. Drugs: There are options to use cigarettes in the game. Some characters can be seen smoking as well. I don’t recall any drinking yet. The controls in the game are consistent with the previous Red Dead Redepmtion, but they can be confusing depending on the situation. For example, the R2 button (on the PS4) is used to shoot, but there was a time that I was prompted to use the R2 button to point my gun at some people to convince them to get into a train. It felt like this would have shot them, which I wasn’t wanting to do. Another thing with the controls is holding down buttons while navigating menu systems, such as the equipment wheel, and other buttons that have to be held—at least briefly—before getting the response from the system. I have been confused at times when it is safe to release the held button/buttons, which is somewhat complicated for playing. Overall, the game is amazing and I’m excited to experience more of it! The story, direction, acting, musical score, graphical detail, and the world that the experience is set in is fantastic! I appreciate that the game is not afraid to slow down to show the player that there is a living world to experience, not just run through and shoot up. The contrast from the snowy environment with few wildlife encounters, and then going to warmer forrests with believable animals going about their own lives in herds and realistically responding to approaching humans is mind-boggling. I can’t imagine all the time even one person spent on the detail that was added to make this more than just a game, but an experience that is convincing. I’ve gone on long enough about content that is separate from the age rating for the game, but I would highly recommend it for appropriate audiences.
There’s little to no sexual content and the worst it gets is a few f-bombs. This is fine for a 12 year old.
Over the past day I have been playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I played the first one and loved it. I could of done without the sexual themes in it though and it would not of affected me at all. I am aware that there is over 60 hours of gameplay so I do not know everything about the game. When playing the game there is lots of foul language but no more than what you would hear at your average middle school. F- bomb, [email protected], [email protected] I am ok with the language and the violence for my kid as because I know he is mature enough to handle it. I just did not let him play it at first because of the nudity. Unlike the last Red Dead and GTA 5 the sexual content is dialed down quite a bit in this game. The character you play as can not have sex with other characters at all in the game. There is cleavage shown a bit and a males genitals are shown though in a non-sexual way. There are only two scenes with a little engagement with sexual activity. During the storyline you save a woman from being raped but during the other scene you walk in on a man and a woman having sex. I believe that if your child is mature enough for this game and is 12-13 years or older s/he should be aloud to play this game. It is much better than some of Rockstars other masterpieces.
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and I gave this game a PEGI 16 age rating(ESRB TEEN equivalent). I loved the complexity and diversity of this game. The first thing I am going to talk about is violence. Violence(believe it or not) is actually not the goal of the game. Most of the gameplay is RDR2 consists of nice activities such as helping people do their daily chores, taking friends to the bar(will talk about drinking and smoking), and buying some nice and fancy clothes. When violence does occur(there is more violence in single player than multiplayer), is standard fare for an M rated game(doesn't mean the violence is low). Gunshots will not emit any blood unless you shoot the legs, hands, or heads. When a headshot or leg shot occurs it can be very brutal. The leg/head can get shot off and gore is visible. This only occurs if you are reckless in the multiplayer and start shooting innocent civilians. Most gunshots emit very little blood though and when from far there is no visible blood. The violence overall is 7/10. Similar violence levels can be found in games like Batman Arkham City, Uncharted series, and Warframe. Strong Language is rarely said. There is little to no language in multiplayer and I only heard around 4 f words in the whole campaign!(the campaign is extremely long). Most of the language used is goddamn and s**t. The language is about 5/10. Video games with a similar level of language is Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and Marvel's Avengers, and Battlefield 1. Sex: you interrupt a couple having sex on accident(may not happen but is not up to you), nothing sensitive is shown. Sex is not present overall. Alcohol is a big issue, characters smoke and get drunk constantly. Alcohol is 6/10. An example of this high level of drinking and smoking would be Batman Arkham Knight. Overall the age rating for me would be(PEGI 16/TEEN). If this game was a movie it would be 12a(America: PG-13). Don't get this game for your 13-year-old if you feel that they are a bit reckless and need to learn the value of human life. Thank you.
I first should warn parents to keep anyone under 18 away from this game due to the pervasiveness of certain elements like coarse bad language and some violent disturbing scenes which mostly occur in the cutscenes between gameplay. Some missions in the game, even when the player is trying to do them for high honor will still involve killing people. And sometimes killing a certain character such as in bounty hunting missions will still yield good honor although usually not as much as taking them alive. Or killing a character who is considered too evil to be kept alive. As a counselor I simply don't believe that even truly evil people should have to die for their bad deeds. What sets this game apart from others such as GTA however is that there is a good and bad honor system which increases positively when the player makes the right choices and refrains from committing crimes. Or will decrease when the player steals, kills people or commits other criminal activity. the high honor seems to give greater rewards than negative honor and it affects the ending as well. this is the only reason why I would even begin to consider allowing any young adult to play. It gives the option to work honestly for something you want instead of always stealing and killing for it like GTA which only rewards these negative choices and actions. Be aware however that many who play will still be tempted in the game to do the wrong things and cause trouble and you may have to enforce your point and check their honor status to make sure they are following the conditions to play the game. You may even have to play it with them until they can be trusted alone. Rules are Bad honor- game off. Good honor- game on. this in turn will keep the player from mercilessly rampaging, killing and torturing many innocent NPC's in the game and stealing which makes it far less violent. Otherwise it is quite possible to do some extremely heinous and cruel inhuman things. I even think I heard you can skin people and lynch them. I've already seen that it is possible in the game to set fires which is a major NO to me and why I strongly urge intense thinking before letting anyone play. It however also does reward slight positive honor for surrendering and accepting the consequences if the player should make a bad choice. I'm not happy that it, like a GTA game still releases you from jail whenever you commit any crime including murder. I would tell everyone to still avoid games like the GTA series in that there is no good or bad honor system and therefore it makes it seem like crime is the only way to win and therefore encourages it. And certain characters in the Rdr series actually have good morals and aren't just a bunch of sick jokes like GTA. again no younger individuals than 17 years old should play and they must understand the differences between a video game and real life. if they keep their habits clean and they are playing responsibly then they will find this game still has much to offer and is worth it. I might add that it has slight educational factors due to how it takes place in late 1800s early 1900 and players will want to know about history and how things were back in those days. the world is jaw-dropping huge and most all of it can be explored without violence. But only a top of the line gaming pc of 2019 or 2020 will have even a moderate chance of running this game at it's best. you really will want this game, but it will cost you on it's own and dearly for the nessesary system to run it. and also whatever happens DO NOT let your kids play Rdr ONLINE mode. GTA as well as Rdr online is where some of the most dark and evil behaviors and influences can be found and the in-game can become a bloodbath with players shouting words like "I hate you and I'll kill you!. Players can form gangs who follow their own path and encourage others to commit crime and this by it's very nature simulates gang activity in real life. Added to the fact that online gaming is not safe in many other ways. you simply will not go one second without some young nerdy punk cursing and swearing and joking around.
It’s an amazing game and if your kid can handle the language he should be fine if you know what he’s doing. You can make your own choices in this game so your not forced to do anything. Though the campaign only really has language
My son had anger issues so we took him to a therapist and she said she will help and she kinda did when we got back home me and his mom did work cause of corona and when it was lunch i found him watching a violent swearing movie and it caused his violence to go down so we got him this game it has little swearing (kids hear swearing at middle school and up) pretty much no nutity and some violence but it helps our son it also has good role models arthur is nice sometimes but i does have drinking .drugs .smoking but you should of taught your son not to get spend his money on that stuff when he is older
The game is violent - but only if you shoot the head, hands or legs. Sex is mild (almost nonexistent) where there is only one scene where you walk in on it. Language is what you'd expect - I heard ruder things in middle school. Only 3-4 f***s in the main story and only by the Irish who aren't a main part of the story. Let your kids have this game if they are mature enough to know they shouldn't repeat these actions.
you can blow heads to bits, sooooooooooo fun!
WARNING THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS OF THIS GAME This game is Amazing for Adults and kids! Sure there may be some Swearing and Violence but the story is amazing and well made and Much better than GTA Story (My opinion) The game requires some Maturity to play considering there are a couple of sex scenes (only shows for like 3 seconds) and there are only 3 F*** words in the story and only cusses every 30 mins. The story has a good Morale of.... SPOLIER be loyal to what matters to you. This game is also about Redemption of a outlaw named Arthur Morgan who had done bad with a gang leaded by Dutch Van Der Linde. He got Tuberculosis from beating up a man for 10 bucks. He became good and sadly SSSSSPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOILLLLLER he dies :((((((. This game teaches you to be loyal to what matters to you and no matter how much you sinned, you can be good. It is easy to play if you know the controls. There is a lot of violence and some alcohol and the good thing is the game are not money grabbing corrupt game like EA is.
Now. The violence is EXTREME. 20x worse than grand theft auto, you can do things from blow off people’s limbs to pushing them off a train. The language is barely anything. Barely any F words. Mostly just b*tch, son of a b*tch. Sex is not much except talk. There ARE prostitutes although you can only decline. You are set as an outlaw although there is an honour system. You can smoke &amp; get drunk, no drugs. 10/10 for people aged 15+.
