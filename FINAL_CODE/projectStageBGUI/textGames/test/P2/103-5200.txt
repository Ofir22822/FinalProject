Steven: World of Warcraft's been in a rough spot the last few years, which is why it's slid down a bit on our list. Despite the latest expansion, Battle for Azeroth, having a lot of issues that get in the way of what WoW does best, this is still a worthwhile and entertaining MMO full of adventure.

Fraser: I’ve quit yet again. After just coming back, too. But I know it’s going to be temporary, because nothing has ever scratched that MMO itch quite like WoW. 

69. Destiny 2
Released 2017 | Last position 14

Destiny 2

(Image credit: Bungie)
Tim: Firstly, nice. Secondly, the reason for Destiny 2's precipitous drop largely stems from how little the team likes the current seasonal model. The return of iconic character Saint-14 made Season of Dawn fun, and it had a decent new activity and weapons, but Trials of Osiris whiffing made Season of the Worthy feel really anemic. This September's big expansion, Beyond Light, looks promising, with a whole new damage type and accompanying subclasses to play with. But the biggest reason to keep Destiny 2 around is that there really isn't a comparable AAA shooter which offers anything like the same amount of free content stuff to explore. New Light's onboarding experience might be a mess, but the quality of the gunplay and art design still absolutely bodies the competition.

Phil: Count me among those campaigning for Destiny 2 to drop down the list this year. And yet, for all of Year 3's problems, I'm probably playing it more than ever right now. That's in large part due to me finally getting a team together to do some raids, which are frankly a brilliant reason to invest in this game and its bullshit. Each is a mechanically fascinating exploration of the things you can do with a) orbs, b) plates and c) orbs and plates, and the sense of achievement when everything comes together for your first completion is palpable. It's just a shame five of them are being removed in November. 

68. Warframe
Released 2013 | Last position 27

Warframe

(Image credit: Digital Extremes)
Steven: Warframe's last year hasn't exactly been its best. Ambitious updates like the new ship-to-ship combat was dragged down by bugs, poor balancing, and a grind that sometimes feels like a needless distraction. But even in spite of that, Warframe remains one of the best looter shooters you can play. It's just so weird and full of strange ideas that have slowly congealed into a fascinating shooter where one minute you're bullet-time sliding through a group of super mutant soldiers and the next you're dancing with your friends to a crude version of Da Rude's Sandstorm that you hand-programmed on the in-game synthesizer. That unique sense of strange keeps Warframe compelling even when Digital Extremes' unwillingness to play it safe bites it in the ass.

Don't get me wrong, though. Warframe succeeds far more often than it fails. Though it's far more complex than other games, like Destiny 2, that complexity also creates an enormous amount of depth that's kept me playing for hundreds of hours. Though some might lament the lack of a true endgame, I really enjoy Warframe's horizontal progression that encourages me to set my own goals, like crafting new warframes or unlocking new weapons, and experiment with its vast arsenal. Even if you're not a completionist, Warframe is worth playing just for the story, which also packs some crazy, fun twists.

67. Devil May Cry 5
Released 2019 | Last position 46

Devil May Cry 5

(Image credit: Capcom)
Jacob: By the end of each Devil May Cry 5 mission you will have shredded and ripped and crushed wave after wave of the Underworld's nastiest hellspawn. While it's firmly rooted in its hack and slash history, a choice of three characters offers new opportunities to nail down precise combos and a varying blend of otherworldly and overly-excessive combat. When you finally mash the buttons just right, you're rewarded with an increasingly edgy soundtrack and a gory crescendo of blood, orbs, and rock organ.

Tom: A fast, fluid, beautifully animated brawler with fantastic weapons and an edgy personality. I wish we had more games like this on PC, but until the next sequel there's plenty to enjoy on higher difficulty levels as you master each character's moveset.

66. Her Story
Released 2015 | Last position 65

Her Story

(Image credit: Sam Barlow)
Andy K: Her Story is special because it tells a story in a way only a videogame could. It's a subdued police procedural with a distinctly British sensibility, told entirely out of order. You piece a suspect's story together by digging through a fragmented archive of short interrogation clips, tapping keywords into an old PC to uncover clues about what her story actually is. But the order you find the clips in, which is different for every person who plays the game, can distort your perception of the narrative in interesting ways. The detective story is as old as fiction itself, but Her Story is an excitingly fresh take on it. And if you want more, follow-up Telling Lies expands on the concept with a larger cast of characters and higher production values.

65. Ori and the Will of the Wisps 
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

ori and the will of the wisps

(Image credit: Moon Studios)
Emma: Easily one of the prettiest games to release in 2020, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a Metroidvania that's truly rewarding to explore. New abilities are frequently introduced, encouraging you to thoroughly comb every inch of its beautiful map. Engaging in combat with enemies is difficult at first, but as you master your skill set, landing the perfect combo on a tough creature feels glorious. Be warned, its heartbreaking story will play on your mind for some time afterwards. 

64. Frostpunk
Released 2018 | Last position 63

Frostpunk

(Image credit: 11 bit studios)
Jody: 11 Bit Studios' other game, This War of Mine, is part of the curriculum in Polish schools now. Frostpunk taught me more. For starters, this game about managing a steampunk city through an ice age taught me the value of child labor and religious zealotry. 

I enacted harsh policies to keep citizens from freezing but found myself putting the brakes on as soon as I could. Sure, I passed the law allowing children to work because the engines were on the brink of failing. But when I transitioned them away from picking up coal to light kitchen duty, it felt like I was clawing back a society worth living in, scrambling up the hierarchy of needs. It's powerful stuff.

Chris: It's a challenging survival game and an atmospheric city builder, but at Frostpunk's core is a startlingly believable society simulator. And societies are awful. People are dumb, dishonest, prone to panic, and will accept a ridiculous rumor over a proven fact nine times out of ten. It doesn't matter how well your city is running, your citizens will find some excuse to lose hope, be miserable, and threaten to plunge you into ruin. At times it feels unfair, when everyone is fed and warm and they're still on the brink of revolt, but that's how society works. Humans are always the biggest problem to solve, and Frostpunk gets that.

63. Black Mesa
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

Black Mesa

(Image credit: Crowbar Collective)
Andy K: This ambitious fan-made remake is probably the best way to experience the Black Mesa Incident on a modern PC. It differs from the source material in a lot of ways—particularly the greatly expanded (and improved) Xen chapters—so purists might argue otherwise. But with bigger, more dramatic levels, production values approaching Half-Life 2, and new puzzles and set-pieces, Black Mesa breathes new life into Gordon Freeman's debut adventure. It's astonishing that something this confidently made is, essentially, a fan project. And doubly so that Valve allowed them to sell it on its own distribution platform. If you've ever felt the urge to return to the Black Mesa facility, this is the perfect excuse to go and reintroduce your crowbar to some headcrabs.

62. Euro Truck Simulator 2
Released 2012 | Last position 61

Euro Truck Simulator 2

(Image credit: SCS Software)
Andy K: It might not offer the high-speed thrills of Forza, but ETS2 remains one of the best driving games on PC. Not only do its trucks feel great to drive, with weighty, nuanced handling, but its world is absolutely massive. You can drive from the UK to Russia, stopping at Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and a dozen other countries along the way, which makes it a brilliant road trip simulator. It's also extremely chill, and I always have it installed in case I ever feel the need to hit the motorway and destress.

Phil: American Truck Simulator still slightly edges it out for me, with its focus on sweeping, dusty plains, but whichever flavour you pick, this is a masterful series that understands the simple pleasure of a) driving with purpose, accompanied by nothing but your a radio and your thoughts, and, b) accomplishing a task well, and on time.

61. Fortnite
Released 2017 | Last position 36

James: In 2020, you could catch a live viewing of Inception inside Fortnite. During a time when theaters are closed all over the world, I could watch a movie in a communal space with other people (and by people I mean a dozen Kylo Rens). Travis Scott put on a psychedelic show that drew 12.3 million viewers and doubled as his official music video. Party Royale arrived with its weekly EDM shows and non-violent pub games. Epic turned the damn game off for a few days for marketing purposes. 

Fortnite is still firmly embedded in modern gaming culture. It'll be around for the next decade, easily, and remain popular throughout. For good reason, too. It's a COVID-19 era concert and movie venue. It's a creative sandbox filled with thousands of unique, user-created platforming challenges, combat arenas, and escape rooms. It's a base-defense game layered with RPG systems and loot drops for endless replayability. And, yeah, it's still an excellent battle royale shooter that's still surprising me with every seasonal refresh. We've already seen NPC-patrolled spy bases that turn certain areas into tiny infiltration and deception arenas and now Epic's flooded half the map, transforming every scrap of land into a highly contested hot spot—nevermind the sharks sailing through the air to ruin campers. Still free, still fantastic.

60. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 
Released 2011 | Last position 49

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

(Image credit: Bethesda Softworks)
Fraser: Skyrim is the forever game, nearly a decade old now and still kicking around. It is very large and very good, but it’s really stayed relevant because of the incalculable number of mods that its hard-working community has churned out. Whole new games have been built out of it, along with a slew of improvements that you shouldn’t start your journey without. 

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Jody: Now that expansion-sized mods like Legacy of the Dragonborn are exploring the Special Edition's possibilities, Skyrim feels reborn.

Chris: I still think Oblivion is a better game, but Skyrim does the two most important things right. It lets me be whoever I want and doesn't care if I completely ignore the main storyline. I can pick a direction and enjoy however much or little of the official quests I want. I don't have to be the Dragonborn, I can just explore, fight, interact, and come up with my own personal goals and story. It's not the most finely crafted RPG out there, but the absolute freedom it gives players to build their own character and history is worth the rough edges. Ask someone about their favorite part of the Witcher 3 and they'll tell you about their favorite quest. Ask a Skyrim player, and they'll tell you about the unique character they created and the story they came up with. 

59. Caves of Qud 
Released 2015 | Last position 40

Caves of Qud

(Image credit: Freehold Games)
Steven: A dark horse if there ever was one, Caves of Qud is the best RPG you're not playing. It's like Dwarf Fortress, except much less daunting and centered on a strange, alien world with some of my favorite writing in games. Each time you play, whole cultural histories are randomly generated for you to learn about as you pick through the dilapidated ruins of Qud's lost civilizations. It's a cerebral, ambitious, and impressive RPG with a humble ASCII-like art style.

58. STALKER: Call of Pripyat
Released 2010 | Last position 58

STALKER: Call of Pripyat

(Image credit: GSC Game World)
Chris: You'll probably want to mod the hell out of it. But even in its vanilla form, it's unmatched in the sense of dread it provides. Most games turn you into a superhero, but Stalker never lets you forget you're mortal and that an unceremonious death can happen at any second.

Phil: Tense and dark and foreboding, Stalker is a masterclass in player disempowerment. Between the bandits, the monsters, and the anomalies, it's clear that its open world has no care for your survival. Stalker refuses to let you get comfortable, and that makes it just as oppressive and scary as the most tightly plotted horror game.

57. Unavowed
Released 2018 | Last position 57

Unavowed

(Image credit: Wadjet Eye Games)
Fraser: Urban fantasy with a dash of BioWare's companions and consequences, Unavowed feels like a reimagining of classic point-and-click adventures. It's steeped in puzzles—most expertly woven into the story—and handsome pixel art, but it also offers more freedom to chart the course of your adventure, giving you authorship over the story. 

Phil: I've loved Wadjet Eye's games since the first in the Blackwell series, but Unavowed is on another level. It's exceptionally clever: a party-based point-and-click that lets you develop real attachment to its cast of eccentric characters, and offers up plenty of twists on the many cliches of supernatural fiction.

56. Prey
Released 2017 | Last position New entry 

Prey

(Image credit: Arkane Studios)
Jody: A spooky space station game in which you play Prop Hunt, where any medkit could be a spider-monster while you have a glue gun and Nerf darts. It's not just another space station game. It's the ultimate. Arkane didn't remake Prey, they made System Shock 3 and called it Prey.

Phil: One of Prey's biggest achievements is making Talos I feel like an actual, coherent place. Sure, it's built out of a series of segmented levels with loading screens between them, but the fact you have multiple routes to each area—one of which simply involves leaving the station and floating off to a different hatch—gives it a real presence. Prey's actual biggest achievement, though, is more monumental entirely: it has a crafting system that's good.

55. Session
Released 2019 | Last position New entry 

Session

(Image credit: Crea-ture Studios)
James: You can play Session with classic Skate controls. Cool and fine. Or, if you're a maniac like me, you can control each foot with a stick and turn on manual catching and kick strength and spin power to make Session into a skateboard QWOP. It makes a single flatland, crawling kickflip a pretty big accomplishment, and I'll never be a good virtual skater. But like the early '00s, I'm watching the best of the best begin to emerge from the virtual scene, with players like JAHDexe making legit, unique skate videos. There's even a Session collective, Dizzy Skateboarding Co., highlighting the cream of the crop in montages that take me back to the best Girl's Yeah Right or Zero's Misled Youth. 

54. Resident Evil 2
Released 2019 | Last position 29 

Resident Evil 2

(Image credit: Capcom)
Robin: I never even played the original Resi 2, and I still adored this remake. It absolutely stands up on its merits as just a fantastic bit of survival horror. It’s such a pleasure picking your way through its intricate maps—solving puzzles, finding secrets, and trying not to get eaten. Controversial opinion, though: I could’ve done without Mr X. He’s too mechanical to be scary, but enough of an obstacle to be frustrating. I just wanted to poke around at my leisure.

Andy K: Remakes don’t get much better than this. Not only does it remain true to the spirit of the original, but it remixes and modernises it too. Stepping into the RPD building, you get the same feeling you did back in the PlayStation era. A mix of awe and fear, as you wonder what darkness lurks in the corners of this beautiful old building. But with modern textures, lighting, and shadows—not to mention a shift to full 3D—the atmosphere of the place is radically heightened. This is the game you know and love at its core, but with a fresh spin on almost everything, and a much scarier Tyrant. It’s the best Resi in years, rooted in the past, but looking to the future as well. 

53. Dusk
Released 2018 | Last position 53 

Dusk

(Image credit: New Blood Interactive)
Tyler Wilde: I find Dusk ugly compared to other recent FPS throwbacks like Amid Evil and Ion Fury, but having been a Quake fan, I get the nostalgia. And it plays just right if you're fond of the classics: you move like you're on ice skates and shoot like you're playing a clicker game.

Tom: Even the reload animations are fun in this fond reflection of old-school shooters. You don't even have hands, but you can still spin your floating twin shotguns to magically put new shells into the barrel. The levels travel between B-movie genres, and are actually funny. I've never thought of level design as a medium for humour, but when I go down a tunnel and suddenly fight a giant alligator for no reason, I can't help but laugh. 

52. Stardew Valley
Released 2016 | Last position 52 

Stardew Valley

(Image credit: ConcernedApe)
Rachel Watts: Stardew Valley is a pocket of calm, especially in these trying times. The slice-of-life sim lets you lead the life of a farmer. You can build any type of farm you like, from a profitable vegetable empire to a cosy barn with a few flower patches. Being plonked on a huge empty lot might seem a little daunting, but once you settle in the seasons will fly by. Seeing the money roll in from your epic shipment of green beans after nurturing them for 10 straight days is a feeling like no other. 

When you want a break from your farming life, you can wander around Pelican Town befriending its residents. Getting to know the community and the learning about the underlying magic of the town always gives you more to discover. Stardew Valley is both a blessing and a curse. It's a peaceful game, but it will make your heart ache for the tranquility of the countryside. 

Fraser: I get to live out the fantasy of not killing every plant I try to grow and the fantasy of having a thriving social life. Highly recommended for plant-killing hermits. 

51. Path of Exile
Released 2013 | Last position 50

Path of Exile

(Image credit: Grinding Gear Games)
Steven: Quarterly expansions continue to reinvent the base game in strange, exciting new ways. Its current expansion, for example, lets you tend a garden by planting seeds that grow monsters for you to kill for loot. It's so weird, but I love how consistently Path of Exile makes clicking on things until they die fun. I've only scraped the surface of its more complex systems and endgame, and frequent updates and improvements have kept it from aging. This is still the king of ARPGs.

Tom: It's astonishing how much you get for free in this game. Purchases are mainly tied to glitzy exotics, but you still have access to the full depth of Path of Exile's RPG systems. If you think the vast, sprawling skill board is daunting, wait until you get into the intricacies of combining weapons on your items to create deadly or hilarious combinations.

Grand Theft Auto 5

(Image credit: Rockstar)
Chris: It's been long enough that I've forgotten most of the details of the 40-hour story, but who cares? GTA 5 remains a glorious sandbox of destruction and mayhem, even without a story. You can grab some friends and go bananas in GTA Online together, or go on a reckless stunt-driving and plane-stealing spree alone in singleplayer. Thousands of mods keep it fresh, but it barely needs them. I'll keep happily playing GTA 5 until the next one comes along.

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Andy K: I often struggle to finish open world games, but I’ve seen GTA V’s story through to the end three times now. After the dark, downbeat GTA IV, this is a game bubbling with colour and excitement, and every mission throws up some new gimmick, minigame, gadget, vehicle, or absurd moment of slapstick comedy. I love seeing Los Santos and the surrounding countryside through the eyes of three very different characters, and I love how the stakes keep escalating until, by the end, you feel like you’re playing the lead in a Michael Bay movie, leaping out of planes and infiltrating high-security secret labs.

49. Opus Magnum
Released 2017 | Last position 48

Opus Magnum

(Image credit: zachtronics)
Tyler: A brilliant puzzle game. Each level is a condensed factory building problem with many solutions, but only some are elegant enough to feel satisfying. It's the only puzzle game where, after finally solving a level, I've refused to move on to the next one because I knew I could solve it better.

Phil: It helps—or maybe doesn't—that its leaderboard system is very good at telling you how much more elegantly your friends have beaten each level. But it also offers multiple ways to achieve that feeling of mastery. Your alchemy machines can target space, efficiency or time, and each requires a slightly different way of thinking. Alternatively you can ignore pure numbers and just make something that looks pretty in motion—even turning it into a gif for your future satisfaction.

48. Minecraft

Minecraft

(Image credit: Mojang)
Rachel: Minecraft is the ultimate playground for creativity. The blocky sandbox has inspired a whole generation of players, from passionate kids to an industry of professional builders. Projects like the Uncensored Library, the charity Block By Block, and hundreds of other initiatives prove that Minecraft is a gaming force for good. 

Chris: I've been avoiding Minecraft for the past few years because when I inevitably start it up it sucks a few more days out of my life. Having endless possibilities will do that. Whenever I need to go in to grab a screenshot or video of something, I'll look around and see all the projects I was working on but never finished, or a distant mountaintop or gulch will catch my eye, or I'll spawn a new world and start exploring, or I'll click on creative mode and find myself messing around until the wee hours of the morning. 

47. Portal 2
Released 2011 | Last position 30 

Portal 2

(Image credit: Valve)
Wes: The funniest game ever written? Likely. More importantly, Portal 2 is the finest example of the Steam Workshop's success, with a near-infinite selection of user-made maps. I played the campaign once, but many more weekends with a co-op friend, hungry for new puzzles to punish our brains with.

Robin: I think for me this game still holds the crown for the most ‘ah ha!’ moments of any puzzle game I’ve played—especially in co-op. It’s tricky, but in a way that makes you feel like a genius, rather than an idiot. 

46. Rocket League
Released 2015 | Last position 25

Rocket League

(Image credit: Psyonix)
Tyler: You don't hear much about Rocket League these days, but you don't hear about bowling, either, and people haven't stopped playing that. As other competitive games come and go, Rocket League remains an unmovable pastime. It isn't just because 'soccer, but with cars' was a novel idea. Others have tried to replicate Rocket League and have failed because they lack the subtle controls that enable gorgeous and subtle fake outs, trick shots, and passing plays. After 1,000 hours, I'm still trying to air dribble properly.

45. Civilization VI 
Released 2016 | Last position 44

Civilization VI

(Image credit: 2K)
Fraser: Civ typically gets two expansions before the focus shifts to the next one, but Civ VI is unexpectedly still going. It’s definitely shaping up to be the densest of the 4X series, with more civs and scenarios still coming, and with the big changes the base game made to cities, and the expansions’ interesting experiments with golden ages, dark ages and climate change, it’s another strong entry in the immortal series. And now you can also convert cities with rock bands.

Tom: I was a little cold on it when I started playing Civ VI. I liked the city changes but preferred the more subtle art of Civ V. I think if I was going to play any game in the series it would be the fourth, but as Fraser notes, the pattern of expansions should help Civilization VI overtake the previous games in terms of depth and sheer variety of approach you can take to world domination.

44. Arma 3
Released 2013 | Last position 42 

Arma 3

(Image credit: Bohemia Interactive)
Fraser: Arma 3's a serious, daunting military sim that conjures up an infinite supply of agonisingly tense sniper duels, convoy ambushes, night-time raids and all-out battles. But for extended lengths of time it's horrifyingly quiet, full of long build-ups as you crawl through undergrowth, nervously dash through exposed areas and constantly keep an eye out for any signs of life. And then there's the crackle of gunfire, or a sniper's shot echoing through a valley, and you're diving behind cover, trying to figure out where it's coming from. 

Instead of being a gun on legs, you're a fleshy, vulnerable soldier, but also a flexible one. You can quickly shift between different horizontal and vertical stances, giving you a great deal of fine control over your body. Usually it's a treat to be able to just go prone, but Arma 3's got an absurd nine stances. So even when it's at its most stressful, you'll always feel in control, empowered by a long list of options, as well as fancy military toys.  

But that's just one facet of a much larger creative sandbox. Thanks to its editor and an army of modders, Arma 3 can be pretty much anything. Even its official DLC takes things in unexpected directions, like go-karting and an entire campaign dedicated to first contact with aliens. 

43. Metal Gear Solid V
Released 2015 | Last position 21

Metal Gear Solid V

(Image credit: Konami)
Jorge Jimenez: Hideo Kojima's swan song to the Metal Gear franchise before his unceremoniously departure from Konami to start his own studio, MGSV is one of the best stealth action games you can get your hands on. This ambitious sandbox game values your freedom to handle any mission you see fit. From sneaking around military bases with your dog (who also has an eye-patch) to calling in a chopper that's blasting Hall and Oates' Maneater on the battlefield—these are just a tiny fraction of the hijinx you'll get into.

Andy K: As a longtime Metal Gear Solid fan, I was disappointed with The Phantom Pain from a story perspective. Whether by design or not, the narrative is paper-thin and wholly unsatisfying. But the stealth itself is easily my favourite in the series. The more you play, the deeper the sandbox gets. You’re constantly unlocking new gadgets and weapons, which steadily grow more absurd until you’re launching a bionic arm at enemies and using wormholes to send sheep back to your base. It’s a joyous collection of fun interlocking systems and endlessly rewarding. If only the story was as good.

42. Assassin's Creed Odyssey
Released 2018 | Last position 32 

Assassin's Creed Odyssey

(Image credit: Ubisoft)
Robin: I think Odyssey’s often really underrated—dismissed as just another Ubisoft sandbox. Sure, it’s got way too much bloat, and its Witcher-like RPG aspirations don’t always gel super well with AC’s accumulated mechanical baggage. But its world is just completely spectacular. Even if you don’t enjoy the action, you’ve got to recognise what a technical marvel its realisation of Ancient Greece is—utterly huge and packed with authentic detail and mythological wonder. Few digital spaces are as breath-taking to simply travel across. 

Fraser: I have spent something like 150 hours traipsing around Greece with Kassandra, and I didn’t even get close to finishing everything. Assassin’s Creed has never been stingy with the diversions. There are usually too many, and that’s the case here, but I was compelled to spend a ridiculous amount of time in Odyssey because it’s such an astounding world. Over every hill, within every city and across every stretch of sea there are incalculable wonders and vistas waiting to be explored and snapped with the excellent in-game camera. It’s a great place for a holiday, with only a bit of murder getting in the way of the relaxation.    

41. Halo: The Master Chief Collection 
Released 2019 | Last position New entry 

Halo: The Master Chief Collection

(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios)
Wes: Halo was the first FPS to nail shooting on a gamepad, but once you play on PC, with mouse and keyboard and a 144Hz monitor, there's no going back. With each game added the Master Chief Collection becomes a better deal on PC. They look old, but the campaigns still offer some of the best sandbox level design in shooter history, and multiplayer runs so smoothly on modern dedicated servers.

Steven: Yeah, does Halo really need to be justified? It's fuckin' Halo! Even by today's standards, I'm still blown away by some of the missions in Halo 1 (Flood levels notwithstanding) and I love reliving my teenage years playing Zombies in Halo 2. Everything else—including support for modern displays and hardware—is just a bonus.
