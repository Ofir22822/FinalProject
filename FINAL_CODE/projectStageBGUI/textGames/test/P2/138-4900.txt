Believe it or not, this "new" Donkey Kong Country game was actually released a few years ago on the Wii U. It's a 3D side-scroller port where you play as DK or one of his many friends to help save their home from Vikings.

Kiss your social life goodbye, though, because it's easy to get sucked in, especially since the game is portable now. On the Switch, Skyrim has improved graphics and now supports motion controls, meaning that you can aim your Joy-Con like a bow or swing it like a sword to attack enemies, and fire off spells with just a flick of the wrist.

Link’s Awakening is a remake of the 1993 Game Boy title, but this time around, it features a whole new tilt-shift art style that makes Link and his pals look like toys.

As you’d expect, the game has plenty of puzzles, dungeons to explore, and enemies to defeat. The game even features some enemies from the Super Mario series. We’re here for this crossover and will never turn down a new Zelda game.

18
LEGO DC Super-Villains

19
Luigi’s Mansion 3

walmart.com
$53.69
SHOP NOW
The latest Luigi’s Mansion game is impossible to put down. In it, Luigi is forced to conquer his fears yet again after his brother Mario and their friends go missing after a stay at the towering Last Resort hotel.

Luigi uses many of the same tools from past games, like his handy Poltergust vacuum backpack, and he also has a sidekick of his own: Gooigi, a sort of Jell-O-ish version of himself. He'll come in handy to get through several puzzles and levels throughout the game.

20
Lumines Remastered

amazon.com
$14.99
SHOP NOW
For puzzle lovers who’ve played endless hours of Tetris on the Switch, your next purchase should be Lumines Remastered. Its fusion of visuals, music, and gameplay is engrossing. The game is similar to Tetris, in the sense that you’ll have to move and rotate falling blocks and match them up by color.

However, Lumines isn’t about building a wall to unbuild it, it’s more about growing territory of a specific color. Your mistakes won’t come back to bite you as much, either. If you’re a fan of puzzle games, buy this game immediately.

21

Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

amazon.com
$59.99 $28.03 (53% off)
SHOP NOW
When we first played this crossover Switch title, we were confused and surprised that it even existed in the first place.

Despite its zany storyline, where time-traveling Rabbids find their way into the Mushroom Kingdom by way of a washing machine and an object-merging VR helmet, this game manages to keep you entertained thanks to its challenging X-Com-style mechanics, storytelling, and impressive musical score.

It's a funny, imaginative, and enjoyable strategy game that's difficult to put down.

23
Mario Tennis Aces

amazon.com
$59.99 $45.40 (24% off)
SHOP NOW
Mario Tennis Aces is a frustratingly fun and competitively challenging Switch game that will bring back a lot of memories from your N64 and GameCube days. The game is packed full of all your favorite characters from Nintendo games, and each one has their own separate strengths, weaknesses, and special attacks.

If online tournaments aren't your forte, Aces offers several different play modes, including one that has a storyline. If you enjoy competitive gameplay both with friends and online, we think you’ll love this new Mario Tennis game.

24
Mega Man Zero/Zx Legacy Collection

amazon.com
$19.10
SHOP NOW
This collection is packed with six action-filled Mega Man titles for life-long fans of the franchise and new players alike. It includes all four Mega Man Zero games, as well as Mega Man ZX and ZX Advent, along with plenty of bonus content. Thankfully, it brings a save mode so you can play the game at a more relaxed pace. 

If you like jump-and-shoot side-scrolling games, Mega Man is worth checking out if you missed it in your youth.

25
Mortal Kombat 11

amazon.com
$59.99 $26.84 (55% off)
SHOP NOW
If you thought Mortal Kombat X was amazing, wait until you get your hands on Mortal Kombat 11. As you'd expect, it features a roster of new and returning fighters, perfect for co-op play.

Plus, it even has custom character variations — a first for the iconic franchise. However, this fighting game is incredibly graphic and is not suitable for younger children.

26
My Friend Pedro

amazon.com
$19.99 $17.99 (10% off)
SHOP NOW
You know that moment in action movies when time slows down and the hero of the story dodges a bunch of bullets by mere inches and manages to take out the bad guys without breaking a sweat? That’s kind of what playing My Friend Pedro is like. In this side-scrolling action game, you basically obliterate anybody in your path as you try to reach the exit.

It’s an excellent game to play in handheld mode since levels are short and the gameplay is wicked fast. My Friend Pedro is an intense game that’s equally action-packed, nonsensical, and creative. If you want a game that’ll make you feel like a badass, it’s a must-buy. You can pick up a physical edition of this game here.

27
NBA 2K20

amazon.com
$9.99
SHOP NOW
One of the coolest parts about NBA 2K20 is that each player has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some are more confident behind the foul line, others can bank 3-pointers like nothing, some dribble quicker, and others shine at defense.

What we love is how much hard work and dedication it takes to successfully master this sports game. Gameplay both looks and feels like a real-life NBA game — from the dripping sweat to the detailed expressions and everything in between.

28
New Super Lucky's Tale

amazon.com
$35.99
SHOP NOW
This game got a shout-out from the queen of Twitter herself, Chrissy Teigen. It’s a no-frills platformer — similar to Mario games — in which you jump, burrow, and tail swipe your way to victory.

This Switch exclusive is packed with plenty of puzzles and items to collect. Gamers looking for a challenge should look elsewhere, but if you want a chill yet cute game to zone out and play, New Super Lucky’s Tale offers a lot of entertainment.

29
New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe

amazon.com
$59.99 $53.23 (11% off)
SHOP NOW
Chances are, you missed out on New Super Mario Bros. U when it was released on the Wii U a few years ago. Luckily, Nintendo ported it to the Switch, so you can play the game anywhere without being tied to your television. Even better, it packs all-new characters, levels, and improved controls.

It’s everything you love about Mario games: fun levels, multiple characters with their own unique abilities, and a co-op mode so that friends can get in on the action. We’ve been playing this game nonstop for months and still haven’t grown tired of it!

30
Night in the Woods

amazon.com
$19.99
SHOP NOW
Night in the Woods is a hilariously clever, single-player, side-scrolling narrative game that'll definitely make your commute more fun. It follows a 20-year-old cat named Mae Borowski who dropped out of college to move back to her small hometown, Possum Springs. It's a witty game with excellent dialogue and lots to explore.

31
Overcooked! 2

amazon.com
$24.99
SHOP NOW
Overcooked 2 is one of those overwhelming but fun video games where a lot is happening at once and you just laugh and go along with it.

The game is meant to be played with friends, and it's simple to pick up and play (even if you haven't played the first one). Basically, the premise is to cut, cook, and serve food to zombie invaders of the Onion Kingdom called the Unbread. It sounds crazy, and it is, but this is our new multiplayer fave.

32
Overwatch Legendary Edition

walmart.com
$39.99
SHOP NOW
Overwatch comes from the same folks behind the Warcraft and Starcraft franchises. It features massive worlds to explore and wage battles in. What makes the game shine are its numerous diverse characters — 23 to be exact — and an overarching sense of the importance of teamwork.

It's worth mentioning that this title isn't new. It previously was available on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, so it doesn't run quite as smoothly, but it's perfectly playable and is now portable.

33
Owlboy

amazon.com
$16.99
SHOP NOW
After almost a decade of development, Owlboy finally was released on the Nintendo Switch. It's a vertical platform adventure game starring Otus the Owl and takes place in the sky. Its artwork and score are masterful, and you’ll find yourself invested in both the characters and its story.

If you're a fan of Zelda and Metroid, you'll love it, especially considering its retro aesthetic.

34
Paper Mario: The Origami King

amazon.com
SHOP NOW
This family-friendly Switch title is a role-playing adventure in which everybody’s favorite plumber, Mario, explores a whimsical world. However, this time he is flat and has to battle an army of origami adversaries. The game is charming, clever, and quite funny. It has snappy battles, lovable characters with lots of depth, and a surprisingly dramatic storyline.

35
Pokemon Sword

amazon.com
$59.26
SHOP NOW
This game marks Nintendo’s first mainline Pokémon game on a home console. Don't worry, it's just as addicting as the handheld titles.

This Switch game features an open-world-style map that's filled with plenty of wild Pokémon. In fact, Pokémon Sword and Shield have a combined 400 Pokémon for players to catch and trade, so this one should definitely keep you occupied for a while.

36
Ring Fit Adventure

amazon.com
$79.99
SHOP NOW
Ring Fit Adventure is a very good fitness game for the Switch that'll seriously get your blood pumping. It has been our saving grace during quarantine and is an excellent way to get a workout in.

It includes a Ring-Con accessory that delivers plenty of resistance and responds to your real-world actions and movements in the game. The game is packed with plenty of mini-games and difficulty levels, and it’s so fun that you’ll want to play it daily. Trust me, it won't collect dust as your Wii Fit balance board did.

37
Rocket League

amazon.com
$34.99
SHOP NOW
Rocket League is one of the most fun and affordable games you can buy. It's arcade-style, and it requires you to drive turbo-charged sports cars while playing soccer. There are all sorts of moves, tricks, and acrobatics your vehicle can perform. Timing is imperative, as is defense.

38
Sega Genesis Classics

amazon.com
$29.99
SHOP NOW
If you grew up playing a Sega Genesis, this collection of games is a must-have. It's packed with more than 50 titles ranging from Sonic to Streets of Rage to Golden Axe, and even RPGs like the Phantasy Star series.

Better yet, you won't have to worry about the games freezing like the old days. You're even able to save your game and rewind if you mess up! Sega Genesis Classics is a nostalgia trip that's totally worth the price.

39
Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing Double Pack

amazon.com
$39.97

Even if you weren't a Sega kid, you've probably still played Sonic. Now, your favorite blue hedgehog and his trusty sidekick, Tails, are back for the Switch.

Sonic Mania is a game that’ll make you feel like a kid again. It offers everything fans want out of a classic Sonic game and more. Not to mention this bundle pack includes an entirely separate game, Team Sonic Racing, which is an absolute blast for multiplayer gaming.

40
Splatoon 2

amazon.com
$89.00
SHOP NOW
Splatoon 2 is an addicting third-person shooter for the Switch that's just as colorful and fun as its predecessor. Rather than using bullets, your weapons fire ink, and as an extra twist, the ink you shoot also paves the way forward — and makes a swimmable path for your character to zip through.

Single-player mode features all-new maps, weapons, and bosses, but the multiplayer mode is what makes Splatoon 2 shine. In the multiplayer mode "Turf War," for example, four players team up against four others to see who can cover the majority of the map in ink.

The Splatoon sequel is a wonderful, welcoming, and fresh game that can be played for hours straight or in quick bursts, making it a must-have for Switch owners.

41
Streets of Rage 4

bestbuy.com
$39.99
SHOP NOW
Side-scrolling beat-‘em-up titles were all the rage in the '80s and '90s, but unfortunately, the genre has mostly sunsetted. It has been 26 years since Streets of Rage 3 came out, and my co-tech editor Stefan Vazharov and I were absolutely elated to see the return of this popular Sega franchise.

The game — and its soundtrack — are absolutely golden. Combat is refreshed thanks to button combos. Overall, the game feels more modern than previous Streets of Rage games. It's action-packed, has a fresh storyline, and Axel and Blaze pick up the fight just where they left off. 

Even if you haven’t played past Streets of Rage games, Streets of Rage 4 is still an absolute must play.

42
Super Mario 3D All-Stars

amazon.com
SHOP NOW
Back when the Super Nintendo was the hottest video game console, Nintendo released a combo pack of older NES Mario games that were overhauled with more colorful graphics. 30 years have since passed, and Nintendo is now doing something similar with Super Mario 3D All-Stars.

This time around though, the game spans three console generations. It includes Super Mario 64 (from the Nintendo 64), Super Mario Sunshine (from the GameCube), and Super Mario Galaxy (from the Wii). All titles are worth checking out. This compilation of Mario games is sure to keep you occupied for months. Buy it soon though, because Nintendo says it’ll only be available until March 31, 2021.

43
Super Mario Maker 2

amazon.com
$59.99 $53.14 (11% off)
SHOP NOW
Fans of Super Mario will absolutely get a kick out of this game, which provides gamers with the tools to create their very own custom Mario levels on their Nintendo Switch. Whether you’re a kid or a kid at heart, this game will keep you occupied for hours on end.

And even if you’re not much of a tinkerer with an affinity for level design, you can pick from and play thousands of levels from a fan community online. The game even has a story mode — a first for the series.

44
Super Mario Odyssey

amazon.com
$109.99
SHOP NOW
Super Mario Odyssey brings back the free-roaming and exploration-based level design that we loved in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. Mario can still triple- and wall-jump, but now he's able to throw out his cap and capture unique abilities from his foes.

It's a fresh and fun video game that requires Mario to team up with a new sidekick, Cappy, so you both can halt Bowser's wedding plans and rescue Princess Peach.

45
Super Mario Party

amazon.com
$58.98
SHOP NOW
Super Mario Party features all-new mini-games (80 in total) that'll bring out your competitive side. The objective is to collect the most stars, but to do that, you have to overcome numerous challenges, backstab your friends, and roll the dice to get to the end of the game board.

The game features all of your favorite Nintendo characters and is one of the best multiplayer titles available for the Switch.

46
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

amazon.com
$58.70
SHOP NOW
With more than 3 million copies sold in just 11 days, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is not only the fastest-selling game in the Super Smash Bros. series — it's the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game of all time!

This game features every single character from the series' history, all-new levels, and multiple game modes. As much as you probably want to go straight to Smash mode to unlock all the characters, we recommend playing the game's single-player adventure "World of Light," instead.

The story is riveting and will help you brush up on your combat skills. We found that local multiplayer battles with your friends work flawlessly, but online gameplay still has some kinks to work out. Regardless, we think that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate more than lives up to the hype.

47
Untitled Goose Game

amazon.com
$19.99
SHOP NOW
Untitled Goose Game took the world by storm in 2019. This out-of-the-box sandbox game stars a chaotic goose who likes wreaking havoc. The premise is simple: waddle around, honk at folks, and become a total trickster as you complete a checklist of tasks. 

If you're a fan of hijinks and classical music, you'll love it. And if you'd prefer to own the physical copy instead of a digital one, you can buy it here.

48

$29.99

This game is one of the best shooters that we've played in years. Its story is impressive and dramatic, and it'll definitely make you think. But it's not for the faint-hearted: The game is brutal, extremely violent, and bloody — after all, it takes place in an alternate history in which we lost World War II, and it requires you to kill a lot of Nazis.
