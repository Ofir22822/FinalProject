At the dawn of a new year it’s always tricky to not get too carried away with the potential a fresh new year brings. With Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Sony’s PlayStation 5 being set to hit shelves during “holiday 2020”, there’s still plenty of time for some incredible games to hit the current crop of machines. Then, of course, there’s Nintendo: a company that’s become a wildcard of late and who could even release an upgraded Switch next year if they felt like it and it wouldn’t even be a surprise.
But 2020 is also the start of a brand-new decade and one that looks like it could be one of the best ever for gaming. Whatever console you’re playing on, there’s a mix of superb-looking high-budget titles, remakes of stone-wall classics and some indie games that look set to shake things up. In no particular order (because they all look great), here are 20 of the games we can’t wait to play in 2020.

The 10 best games of the decade
From blockbusters to indies, the past 10 years have seen gamers spoilt for choice with classic titles of all shapes and sizes. Here’s our pick of the decade’s finest.

These are 10 best indie games of the decade
Over the past 10 years indie developers have delivered some absolutely incredible video game titles. Here's our pick of the very best examples of the decade.

These are the Sony games we’d love to see on Switch
Longstanding Sony hero Crash Bandicoot will soon be making his Switch debut, and here are the other PlayStation franchises we’d love to see on Nintendo’s hybrid console.
Cyberpunk 2077
(CD Projekt RED, Xbox One, PC, PS4, April 16, 2020)

How do you follow up on The Witcher 3, one of the best third-person fantasy RPGs ever made (and one of our games of the decade)? You completely change it up! Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person game and set in a dystopian future full of machinery, hacking and guns. Developers CDPR rarely put a foot wrong and this is going to be comfortably one of the highest-rated games of 2020. The hype is very real, it seems. Also, Keanu.
Ghost of Tsushima
(Sucker Punk, PS4: Summer 2020)

Samurai are cool, right? Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice proved it already, but Sucker Punch (known for the Sly Cooper and Infamous series, both exclusive to PlayStation) are making a huge open world with no waypoints that you can explore without having your hand held. The visuals are incredible looking, to the point it’s almost hard to believe this isn’t a PS5 game. We can’t wait to play this one.
Axiom Verge 2
(Tom Happ, Switch: Fall 2020)

Since Nintendo’s own Metroid game is still a long way off, Axiom Verge developer Tom Happ is bringing a surprise sequel to the console (and we suspect other consoles and PC, but nothing has been announced on that yet). Channelling the original feeling of those 8-bit classics, this new title looks more colourful and vibrant, and we can’t wait to get exploring.
Resident Evil 3

Not content with putting out a remake of Resident Evil 2 and garnering adoration in 2019, Capcom is remaking Resident Evil 3 in the same engine with a 4v1 multiplayer mode called Resistance included, too. It looks intense, exciting and like Nemesis, the enemy who stalks you all through the game, we can’t wait to get our hands on Jill and play through this one again.
Sports Story
(Sidebar Games, Switch: Mid 2020)

Golf Story was a lovely, retro-looking joyous RPG-lite that tasked you with playing through a sports academy by playing golf. Sports Story is adding football, volleyball, tennis, baseball and maybe other disciplines that haven’t yet been announced. What’s not to love? Give us this now, please!
The Last of Us: Part II
(Naughty Dog, PS4: May 29, 2020)
A screenshot from The Last of Us: Part II
Where will Ellie’s tale take us in The Last of Us: Part II?
© NAUGHTY DOG
The long-awaited sequel to one of the best PlayStation exclusives of all time? A new game from the creators of the Uncharted series? What more could you want? It’s been delayed once, so here’s hoping that doesn’t happen again. This looks incredible, and with talk of enemy heartbeats even playing a factor, it sounds like this could be groundbreakingly immersive.
Doom Eternal
(id Software, PS4, Xbox One, PC: March 20, 2020)

The 2016 Doom remake was a game nobody knew they wanted until they played it. That reimagining was one of the best first-person shooters of the generation, with remarkable combat and some intricately designed puzzle-platforming to go with it. The sequel looks set to build on that and add even more traversal options and enemies. Doom Eternal is going to be immense.
Ori and the Will of the Wisps
(Moon Studios, Xbox One, PC: March 11, 2020)
A screenshot from Ori and the Will of the Wisps
A gorgeous-looking game, we’re sure you’ll agree
© MOON STUDIOS
Will of the Wisps is the follow up to one of the best Xbox games from the last 10 years. A glorious, painterly aesthetic is paired with a highly challenging MetroidVania game. Offering difficult combat and platforming, skill upgrades and exploration, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one we really can’t wait to dig into.
Minecraft Dungeons
(Mojang, Xbox One, PC, Switch, PS4: April 2020)

Answering the questions “what will Mojang do next?” and “will there be a Minecraft 2?” simultaneously, the studio behind Minecraft are back with a dungeon crawler (think Diablo) that has no crafting or building but uses the Minecraft look. Again, it’s by the creators of Minecraft, so we’re all in.
Final Fantasy VII Remake
(Square Enix, PS4: March 3, 2020)
A screenshot from Final Fantasy VII: Remake
One of the best games ever, remade to look this good
© SQUARE ENIX
Look, we don’t really want to just say “it’s the long-awaited remake of one of the best games of all time” and be done with it, but that’s exactly what this is. All that remains to be known about part one of this episodic release is how long it’ll be. Will we get out of Midgar, or will we wait another five years to do that? Do we even care? Just give us this right now. Right. Now.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons
(Nintendo, Switch: March 20, 2020)

Speaking of long-awaited, Nintendo are finally giving fans a Switch version of Animal Crossing to play. Hearts were broken when it was delayed out of 2019 and pushed into 2020, but the quality of life improvements and just the fact it’s on Switch are enough for our excitement to be at fever pitch right now. Bring on the debt, Nook!
Psychonauts 2
(Double Fine, PS4, Xbox One, PC: TBC 2020)

Psychonauts fans have waited 15 years for the sequel to Raz’s adventure, but financial difficulties stunted its development. However, Double Fine have since been acquired by Microsoft and it seems Psychonauts 2 is now on target for a 2020 release, so we’ll be able to enjoy some third-person platforming on all formats sometime next year. Great news!
Dying Light 2
(Techland, PC, Xbox One, PS4: TBC 2020)

Dying Light was strangely under-appreciated. Techland took what they’d learned from Dead Island and made an infinitely better game with their first-person-parkour zombie-em-up. Tentatively set for a 2020 release, Dying Light 2 looks to be pushing graphical boundaries, offering unprecedented player choice and, honestly, we wouldn’t be shocked if this was on next-gen hardware as well when it’s released in 2020.
12 Minutes

When publisher AnnaPurna Interactive (What Remains of Edith Finch, Donut County, Telling Lies, Wattam) gets involved, you usually know you’ve got something off-the-wall and really interesting on your hands. Developer Luis Antonio’s game was revealed at E3 2019 by Microsoft and the premise of repeating 12 minutes over and over, a bit like Groundhog Day, has us intrigued. So much happens, and you have to be reactive – we can’t wait.
Streets of Rage 4
(Dotemu/LizardCube, PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch: TBC 2020)

Beloved series? Check. Original composers? You bet! Fresh new art style to give us hope? Oh yes. Streets of Rage, and beat ‘em ups in general, haven’t really been around much in the last decade, so we’re desperate for this to be good. If nothing else, we simply can’t wait to slip into the shoes of Axel, Blaze and Adam again.
Gears Tactics
(Microsoft Studios, PC, Switch: April 28, 2020)

How do you take something like Gears of War and mix things up? Well, you turn it into a top down turn-based strategy game and bring it to PC first (consoles later). A prequel to the original game and focused on a brand-new squad, we’re delighted to see Gears of War try something new and will be there on day one for this.
Bleeding Edge
(Ninja Theory, PC, Xbox One: March 24, 2020)

There was some concern when Bleeding Edge was first announced. Microsoft had just purchased developer Ninja Theory and since Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II hadn’t been announced, it was feared making a multiplayer hero-based competitive game was a strange use of the team. But the more people have played this, the more it seems like it’ll be really good and, frankly, Ninja Theory have earned our trust. Colourful and bombastic, we’re in!
Nioh 2
(Team Ninja, PS4: March 13, 2020)

It looks as though 2020 is currently going to be a slow year for “Souls-like” games, but Nioh was a massively challenging game when it was released in 2017, and a surprisingly high-quality one at that. Team Ninja have always been great at challenging fans (remember Ninja Gaiden?), and Nioh 2 looks set to continue that. If reports from the open betas are anything to go by, this is going to be a cracker.
Marvel's Avengers

Once upon a time, games based on movies and comic books were, to be kind, a bit ropey But things have changed and franchise tie-ins are often superb experiences these days. Marvel’s Avengers has a great pedigree behind it thanks to Crystal Dynamics’ rebooting of the Tomb Raider series, and with a choice of playing single player or co-op, we’re very excited to see how Marvel’s Avengers turns out.
Halo Infinite
(343 Industries, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X: TBC 2020)

You don’t release a new console without a marquee game and Halo Infinite is as high profile as you can get on Xbox. Next-gen + a new Halo = hype. It’s been five years since a new Halo game and launching a new console with one is a surefire way to get people excited. We can’t wait to find out why it’s called Infinite, or to see what developers 343 Industries have been doing with the Chief for the past five years.

The best games of 2020 (so far): From The Last of Us to Fall Guys
From scalding post-apocalyptic drama to jelly-bean gameshows and relaxing island escapes, video games have provided all kinds of escape

Best video games 2020
The Last of Us Part II is a 'scalding treatise on the cycle of violence'
The digital escapism of video games has become ever more important in 2020, as people search for entertainment, distraction and challenge in their vastly altered reality.

Even as we look forward to new games consoles in the form of Xbox Series X and PS5, developers have not let us down in providing us with thrills, spills and relaxation. The best games of 2020 span military action, post-apocalyptic drama, chilled out town management and even giant jelly beans grappling in a flamboyant game-show. 

Here are our favourites of the year so far. If there are any we may have missed, let us know in the comments below and we will be sure to lose ourselves in another new world.

Hades (PC, Switch)
Despite being in early access since 2018, Supergiant’s superb Hades reached its full hellish vision this year. A dungeon-crawling ‘rogue-like’ adventure that has you -as Zagreus, the son of the God of the Dead- trying to escape hell by fighting your way from Tartarus to the River Styx. Combat is supremely crisp, dashing between enemies with your weapon of choice from that particular escape attempt. The god of Olympus send blessings to buff you on your quest, before death sends you back to the House of Hades and tasks you with starting again. Maybe try a different weapon and build Zag’s skills in a different way. Its gameplay loop is brilliantly compulsive, while its art and characterisation build a rich underworld which is difficult to escape in more ways than one.

Paradise Killer (PC, Switch)
And now for something completely different. Paradise Killer from UK studio Kaizen Game Works is a surreal investigation game that takes place in a vivid world of gods and demons. You star as Lady Love Dies, a detective pursuing a murderer on a near-perfect island set to be destroyed by its creators after the crime. You chase down evidence from Paradise’s irreverent band of characters, piecing together events before taking the suspects to trial. Thoroughly weird and entirely brilliant.

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 (PS4, Xbox One)
A masterful remaster of the skateboarding classic, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater stands the test of time chiefly because it is concerned with being an exceptional video game. It never was a skateboarding 'simulation', more a digital fever dream with a diehard reverence for its punkish subculture. The levels are manic combinations of street scenes and skate parks, often mundane urban areas reimagined into a skater's paradise and packed with floating collectibles, secret locations and those special spots designed to reap enormous combinations. This update takes that ethos and adds a high-definition lick of paint and a suite of new mod-cons that makes makes the series feel fresh and relevant as it did 20 years ago.

Microsoft Flight Simulator (PC)
Pushing the boundaries of what might be considered a game, the return of Microsoft Flight Simulator is an extraordinary technical achievement. Using cloud-based mapping tech, MFS allows you to fly anywhere in the world. Whether it’s visiting the pyramids of Giza or the Grand Canyon or performing a flypast of your own house, Flight SImulator lets you do it. You do have to get to grips with the intricately detailed aircraft controls, with the game offering a superb suite of tutorial sand flight aids to tailor the experience.

Battletoads (PC, Xbox One)
Rare’s revival of its boisterous Battletoads -driven by Essex developer Dlala Studios- is a punky and irreverent brawler. As the toads fight for relevance again, the game’s manic energy takes them from snappy fighting to hoverbike races, shoot ‘em up sections and puzzling in a plethora of genre-bending mini-games. Gorgeously animated with caustic Saturday morning cartoon comedy, the Battletoads return is a welcome treat.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout (PS4, PC)
This surprise breakout hit from London developer Mediatonic earns its success with its riotous ‘It’s a Knockout’ multiplayer melee. 60 players online take control of delightfully bulbous contestants as they compete in obstacle courses, gunge runs and platform challenges. Only a select number qualify from each round, until the last remaining contestants fight for the crown. Each event is terrifically tuned to the simple controls and it is hard to wipe the grin from your face, win or lose. Most video games are a thrill in victory, but few games make failure such fun.

Carrion (Xbox One, PC, Switch)
No, 2D action-platformers with a ‘Metroidvania’ are hardly conspicuous by their absence these days, but Carrion comes with a diabolical twist. This time you are the monster, a bio-organic mass that has escaped from its lab-jar confines. Your writhing tentacles sweep through the facility, terrorising your captors and turning them to mulch. There is a gruesome delight to the animation, while its subversion of the genre makes for a dastardly new outlook.

Creaks (Apple Arcade, PC)
A surrealist puzzle-adventure from the developer of Machinarium, Creaks casts you as a gangly layman sucked into a bewildering underground of higgledy towers and creepy creatures. Many of the tasks you face in navigating this world has you figuring out how to tease deadly enemies into cunning positions. Force a rasping, angular dog under a lightbulb and they transform into common furniture to clamber on, for instance, while creepier and more manoeuvrable monsters reveal themselves in time. A testing puzzler brought together by its curious, chatter-free and Kafka-esque milieu. 

Paper Mario: The Origami King (Nintendo Switch)
Nintendo’s most unusual imagining of its famous mascot returns as a curious hybrid of puzzling, action-role-playing and Zelda-esque dungeoneering. Its craft-box world is an utter delight, with a procession of colourful characters and gorgeous folded landscapes to explore. Combat asks you to line-up your foes in a brain-teaser before bopping them with your boots or thwacking them with a hammer. It’s an idea that grows and becomes more layered as you face more difficult foes. The result is a handsome, clever and genuinely funny game that is likely to confound expectations.

Superhot: Mind Control Delete (Xbox One, PS4, PC)
Team Superhot return with its ludicrously effective FPS idea: time only moves when you do. This time the concept has been expanded to a rogue-like affair, players moving through different bite-sized challenges of lobbing guns at digital figures and smacking them with ashtrays. Each segment gets trickier, while buffs can be unlocked to give you an edge. It might not have the shock of the new that the original had but, smartly, it never gets away from that brilliant John Wick-esque core. Just this time: there’s more of it. Hard to argue with that proposition.

Beyond A Steel Sky (Apple Arcade, PC)
A triumphant sequel to Revolution’s classic sci-fi point-and-click adventure. While Beyond A Steel Sky has the modern mod-cons of a third-person adventure, that gloriously arcane puzzling has never been sharper as your ‘Gaplander’ Robert Foster faces tricky tests of tenuous logic in his search for missing children. Witty and charming, the colour-drenched dystopia of Union City is well worth the return trip.

The Last of Us Part II (PS4)
A scalding treatise on the cycle of violence in a ruined world, Naughty Dog’s extraordinary sequel provides one of the most impactful blockbuster video games in years. Our ‘heroine’ Ellie’s trek through a stunningly detailed post-apocalyptic Seattle is full of vicious twists, horror beats and harrowing moments. Yet somehow all of this (and its heart-stopping survival combat) is interspersed with tender humanity delivered by performers at the top of their game.

Desperados III (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
Its real-time tactics in the Wild West for this cracking but tough adventure. Despite the moniker, Desperados III is a prequel, exploring the past of series hero John Cooper in 1870s Colorado, Texas and Mexico. An exceedingly clever mix of stealth and action, Desperados pulls together a band of unique outlaws as you pursue the bandits responsible for John’s fathers death. Six-shooting, knife-hurling and plenty of nefarious traps to set.

Valorant (PC)
League of Legends developer Riot Games spreads its wings with this rambunctious tactical shooter. A heady mix of Counter-Strike and Overwatch, Valorant had already built up a lively community in its beta period which has continued to go from strength to strength since its official June release. With Riot’s beguiling aesthetic and a brilliantly fun spin on the genre, Valorant is set to become a regular fixture in the esports calendar.

Minecraft Dungeons (PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch)
Minecraft Dungeons common epithet of ‘Diablo for kids’ may sound like a jibe, but it is a description that comes with a lot of merit. Building a co-operative action role-playing game for all the family is not an easy task at it seems, meshing hack and slash fantasy brawling and the constant improvement that comes from loads of lovely loot with an accessible kid-friendly veneer. In this, Minecraft Dungeons is a clear success.

Signs of the Sojourner (PC, Switch)
Digital card game with a difference. Instead of pitting your cards against a cross-table opponent, you use your acquired deck to thread together conversations as you travel across a fantasy world. You are a trader following familial routes and encountering a wide range of eccentric characters. Clever, compassionate and uncommon.

Streets of Rage 4 (PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch)
A pitch-perfect attempt at thumping this classic beat ‘em up into 2020 shape. Streets of Rage 4 honours its legacy with scintillating side-scrolling action, but layers on modern brawling mechanics and a gorgeous comic-book aesthetic. Giving thugs a good shoeing has never looked or felt so good.

Gears Tactics (PC)
Following on from Gears 5 success at the end of last year, Microsoft’s blockbuster is finding a bit of a renaissance. Perhaps we weren’t expecting it in the form of a strategy game made by Bromley’s finest -Splash Damage- yet here we are. In truth the cover blasting makes a rather convincing foil for Xcom style tactical maneuvering, while the developers marry that convincing gameplay with Gears’ recognisable brand of muscular sci-fi

Half-Life: Alyx (PC)
Stepping back onto City 17’s brutalist streets for the first time since 2007 would have been a Proustian rush in any circumstance; doing so via the medium of VR is almost overwhelming. Valve have crafted an inherently tactile world that you interact with via the ‘Russels’ -Half-life 2’s game changing gravity gun in glove form. It’s not just that Alyx is a full-fat Half-life game, then - although it certainly helps, with its brilliant world-building and terrifying horror beats - but one that embraces its new medium. Half-life 3 this ain’t, but Alyx is an awe-inspiring amalgamation of atmospherics and immersion which does for VR gaming what its forebears did for the first person shooter genre all those years ago.

Doom Eternal (PS4, Xbox One, PC)
Doom Eternal, like the series successful 2016 reboot, is an orgiastic cacophony of violence. A relentless parade of mulching demons with enormous guns soundtracked by Mick Gordon’s thunderous, escalating heavy metal. As the Doom Slayer, your giant fists swing across the screen like cannonballs, yanking the legs off skittering brain-spiders and jamming it back through their eyeball, feeding a mancubus its own heart or dissecting fodder with a roaring chainsaw. It is relentlessly noisy, gleefully gory and, yes, splendid fun.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch)
Nintendo package off its charming village sim to a desert island, tasking you with crafting your own idyllic town and casting yourself into a lifetime of debt with a talking tanooki. Animal Crossing’s gorgeous escape found a particular resonance during lockdown, the ideal relaxation spot to lose yourself in, tend to your town, meet friends online and even obsess over turnip prices. Perfectly timed and perfectly pitched, Animal Crossing has become an unlikely beacon of hope for a digital generation.

Nioh 2 (PS4)
Many games have tried to capture From Software's 'Soulsborne' sense of challenge, technique and world-building. Few have even come close to succeeding, but Team Ninja's Nioh is one of the best. This 16th century samurai sequel greatly expands on the first game, as you hunt down 'yokai'  in feudal Japan. The swordplay is magnificent, while the challenge is merciless.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps (Xbox One, PC)
The follow-up to magical platformer Ori and the Blind Forest is another game of movement and grace. Ori scampers with definable purpose, leaping over poisoned waters and between thorned outcrops. It is that rare breed of game in which your avatar is completely attuned to your fingertips and experience has allowed Moon Studios to greatly expand on its ideas from the first game.

Read the full review

Call of Duty Warzone (PS4, Xbox One, PC)
Call of Duty’s second crack at battle royale is one of the more inventive entrants into the explosive genre made phenomenon by Fortnite. As you are dropped onto a huge map with scores of other opponents in a fight to the death, Call of Duty: Warzone makes things interesting with contracts to fulfill in the field, loadouts to acquire and a second chance in the one-on-one ‘Gulag’. These tweaks to the formula, teamed with battle royale’s natural tension and CoD’s snappy gunplay, have found further success for Activision’s behemoth.

Lair of the Clockwork God (PC)
Brilliantly funny platform adventure from Brit developer Size Five Games, Lair of the Clockwork God follows the witheringly sarcastic alter-egos of creator Dan Marshall and co-writer Ben Ward through an apocalyptic London. In a terrific twist, you switch control between the two, Dan posing himself as an athletic platform hero and Ben relying on more traditional point-and-click adventuring. Pairing the two styles is a real treat, allowing for some inventive set-pieces, while its side-splitting snark has a humour hit-rate that is all too rare in video games.

Dreams (PS4)
Media Molecule’s extraordinary creative toolbox gives its players unprecedented scope to build their own games or digital artwork.If you are not so artistically-inclined, Dreams has its own series of abstract puzzles as a campaign of sorts. But its real pleasure comes in scouring its bewildering array of player-created masterpieces -from cheeky recreations of existing games, to inventive new ideas or even mouth-wateringly realistic renderings of a full English breakfast.

Zombie Army 4: Dead War (PS4, Xbox One, PC)
Subtle? Goodness me, no. Brain-dead? Not a bit of it. Zombie Army 4 is a game about giving the Nazi undead a damn good thrashing and little else, but developer Rebellion has tuned its action smartly enough that it is consistently great fun and gruesomely moreish. Comparisons to Left 4 Dead -Valve’s co-op zombie thriller par excellence- are a little grand, but Rebellion’s blaster scratches a similar itch you may have in its absence.
