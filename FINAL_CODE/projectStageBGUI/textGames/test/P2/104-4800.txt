Kerbal Space Program

Wes: I'm psyched for KSP2, out in 2021, which will include co-op. Until then, there's nothing else on PC like Kerbal, a game that will inspire you to learn basic rocket physics and feel like a damn genius for every accomplishment.

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Chris: As kind of a dummy, it's nice that a game filled with complicated science stuff is still fun even when you fail. Blowing up a rocket or stranding an adorable astronaut in space is met with laughs, not frustration.

Phil: I'll admit it: I'm still not very good at Kerbal Space Program. I'm fine at getting stuff into space. Bringing it back can be tricky. But one of my favourite things about KSP is that you don't need to be good at it to earn a sense of achievement; you can just put lots of rockets on things and hope for the best. For all its rigorous physics, KSP is still mostly about celebrating creativity and fun.

39. Street Fighter V
Released 2016 | Last position New entry

Emma: Street Fighter V may not have been in the best shape when it launched, but Capcom has nursed it into a fighting game that lives up to its prestigious legacy. Its roster of iconic returning characters—alongside a few new challengers—accommodates a wide range of playstyles that are fun to learn how to counter. More than anything, I respect it for how welcoming it is for beginners. Perfect execution is still a steep grind for novices, but it's more forgiving than previous iterations.

38. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 
Released 2012 | Last position 38 

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

(Image credit: Valve)
Emma: I can't imagine a Top 100 list that doesn't feature Counter-Strike. For me, it's synonymous with PC gaming. Its community is frequently highlighted for its toxicity and this can make it daunting to queue into competitive matches solo. That said, I've made some lovely friends while grinding through its skill groups, and forming a premade squad took over my Friday nights for the best part of a year. 

CS:GO offers a precarious balance of electrifying highs and rock bottom lows that make it just as easy to criticise as it is to fall in love with it. In a good session, the thrills of clutching an important round, or annihilating the other team with a 16-0 finish can put me in a good mood for the rest of the day. On the flip side, seeing my performance dip low enough to have me questioning why I haven't deranked already will leave me sulking in defeat.     

No other game has managed to replicate the same weight behind its weapons, or the heart rate spikes I suffer as I creep onto its bombsites. From the pride I take in lining up a perfect smoke, to the satisfying one-taps I land with the USP-S, there's no substitute. Especially not Valorant.

Subnautica

(Image credit: Subnautica)
Jody: When I want to have a good time in the ocean, frolic with some dolphins and swim through schools of tropical fish, I play Abzu. When I want to have a bad time in the ocean I play Subnautica. There's no frolicking in its alien sea. There are behemoths with eyes bigger than your body who look at you like just maybe you're a morsel worth opening their colossal maw for. There are razormouth jerkfish who will saw through your bones because you had the audacity to swim near their weeds. There are things beyond describing in the crushing depths where it feels like physics don't apply.

I don't know why I play Subnautica actually, but I'll never forget it.

36. Forza Horizon 4

Forza Horizon 4

(Image credit: Playground Games)
James: It's been a stressful year. And whenever I'm stressed, which is always, I meditate. Find a center, breathe, step outside my thoughts. But Forza Horizon 4 is home to perhaps the most potent meditative technique I practice: driving expensive cars through fences and over hummocks in the English countryside. The Horizon series is still the most blissful, accessible, whatever-you-want-it-to-be car game around. I tend to spend a lot of time applying dumb liveries to vans and driving them off cliffs because a van suspended in mid-air feels like a form of existential protest to me. To hell with gravity and roads and lightweight chassis. I'm a van and I can fly. Anyway, you can race cars in Horizon 4 too, I guess.

Phil: Here's a secret, just for you: I don't love Forza Horizon in spite of its dumb, brash tone; I love it because of it. Yes, most of its characters are annoying. Yes, its festival conceit is overbearing. But here's the thing: everyone is having a good time, and they want you to have a good time too. And you will, because doing dumb shit in the countryside is just good.

35. Monster Hunter: World
Released 2018 | Last position 12

Monster Hunter World

(Image credit: Capcom)
Robin: There are few things in games as tense and exciting as one of Monster Hunter World’s monster fights. It’s essentially a game of endless boss battles, with exploring and RPG tinkering in between, and they’re the best boss battles in the business—dynamic, unpredictable brawls where you can be about to lay the killing blow on a fire-breathing tyrannosaurus rex, only to be interrupted by a screeching dragon furious you’ve stumbled into its territory. All the more riveting with friends. 

Wes: World's big expansion, Iceborne, is a great addition. It brings back some of the series' most popular monsters and adds several new ones, adds two giant new maps, and makes a lot of convenient updates to the UI and multiplayer experience that you'll instantly appreciate. It also has the most fun new game weapon of the year: the clutch claw, a grappling hook that lets you punch monsters in the face and ram them into walls. 

34. Super Mega Baseball 3

Super Mega Baseball 3

(Image credit: Metalhead Software)
Chris: It's been a real pleasure watching this cartoony baseball series grow from a fun but casual action game into a sim with real managerial depth and challenge. Franchise Mode is excellent, allowing you to enhance the skills of individual players over the course of the season, sign and release players, and see veterans retire and rookies appear over the winter break, giving your team an evolving history and continuity. Customization lets you control everything from the logo on your team's caps to the structure of the post-season. And Pennant Race is a great online mode challenging you to climb the ladder in a series of games against friends or other players. Metalhead Software swung for the fences, and really connected.

Company of Heroes

(Image credit: SEGA)
Dave James: Where do you go after the vast scale of the Homeworld games, and 40,000 years into the future with Dawn of War? Super small-scale squad-based WWII, obviously. It might not have been the most obvious choice of theatre, but Relic made an RTS that was intimate, brutal, engaging, and intricately tactical. The campaigns themselves were a blast, added to with smart standalone DLC introducing tangibly different factions, and the multiplayer experience delivered some of the most intense, entertaining experiences I've ever had mowing down hordes of Nazis. It was the blueprint for future Dawn of War games, and is a title that still gets installed on my rig for a quick blast whenever I find myself coming down off a Dan Carlin binge.

32. Cities: Skylines
Released 2015 | Last position 31

Cities: Skylines

(Image credit: Paradox Interactive)
Fraser: Cities: Skylines has maintained its position as the best city builder for five years now and shows no signs of giving up the crown. The modders have played a big role in its longevity, churning out a mountain of cosmetic and mechanical changes. I've got something like 200 mods that are just cyberpunk. Every time I think I'm tapped out and can't build another district, I'm seduced back in for another urban experiment. I'll be here until there's a sequel.

Wes: I can attest that Cities: Skylines gets the all-important uncle vote. I gifted the game to mine more than a year ago, and I think he's put more time into it than I've spent with all videogames combined since then.

31. Dark Souls Remastered
Released 2018 | Last position 34

Dark Souls Remastered

(Image credit: FromSoftware)
Wes: I still marvel at the audacity to put an entire area, Ash Lake, behind an invisible wall that many players will never find. Dark Souls' commitment to player discovery is what makes its unforgiving world so entrancing. And the multiplayer is still one-of-a-kind, which is why the hourlong standoff I had with another player over what I thought were traps—but were actually harmless glowing pebbles they put down to taunt me—is still one of my favorite gaming memories.

James: Dark Souls isn't perfect, but it's perfect enough to forgive the Demon Ruins and Lost Izalith, which is why I'm highjacking this space to put out an important PSA. Everyone knows Dark Souls is good. But Dark Souls 2? It's the one to play right now, especially if you haven't yet. It's not as tonally or visually consistent, but the breadth of monster designs, especially in the bosses is unmatched. Fight a frog that pukes out a huge desiccated face. Take down the entire skeleton hierarchy. Trip up a ghost carriage in an ancient coliseum. And do it all dressed as a human butterfly, maybe a jester, perhaps some wooly mammoth cosplay. Stage dive into the heart of chaos in the most metal boss fight in possibly any game. Give the unloved middle child its own special day. 

30. Terraria
Released 2011 | Last position New entry 

Terraria

Wes: I paid 10 bucks for Terraria nine years ago, played many hours of it, and was satisfied. It's surreal to go back to it in 2020, after its last (free) major update, to find the same compelling crafting and exploration expanded with literally thousands of items, massive bosses, and secrets I have to read a wiki to find. Those additions long ago distinguished Terraria from being a 2D Minecraft clone, but it's still staggering just how much awaits discovery in this humble-looking game.

29. Battletech
Released 2018 | Last position New entry 

Battletech

(Image credit: Paradox Interactive)
Fraser: I could build mechs all day. There’s something very calming about putting together titanic killing machines. Sticking jetpacks on axe-wielding behemoths, swapping out piddly little lasers for armour-melting super cannons—it’s not a bad life. The battles are great, of course, but I’m always excited to get back to the garage so I can tweak my lance. 

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Jorge: Battletech has everything I want, space politics, giant mechs, and the never-ending existential dread of trying to keep my band of mercenaries from going bankrupt. 

Evan: Post-launch updates filled in what was a somewhat shallow sandbox at launch, making Battletech a more varied campaign game. But what stands out two years later is the fundamental, pugilistic style of fighting that mechs promote as unique vehicles. Unlike the many zombies, helicopters, spiders, and goblins we fight in videogames, mechs can take a hit. The slow death that mechs experience, their bruises, their limps, their shattered limbs—it's a metallic boxing match that plays out over big battlefields. And like boxing, the knockdown and the knockout are the biggest moments.

28. League of Legends
Released 2009 | Last position 26

League of Legends

(Image credit: Riot Games)
Steven: League of Legends defined esports, but even 11 years on it also continues to be a ridiculously fun and challenging game. Recent changes in season 10 make matches even more dynamic and unpredictable in a good way, and Riot's aggressive balancing keeps the competition fierce.

Fraser: I’ve played one game of League of Legends and that was enough for me. Teamfight Tactics, on the other hand, has somehow managed to get its hooks in me deep. I never make good builds, I can never find the characters I need, I get progressively more drunk and frustrated every time I play, and I love it. 

27. Alien: Isolation
Released 2014 | Last position 23 

Alien Isolation

(Image credit: SEGA)
Andy K: The best horror game on PC—and a pretty great stealth game too. Your alien adversary is unpredictable, dynamic, and adaptive, which makes it a terrifying thing to have stalking you from the shadows of Sevastopol. And the space station’s hard-edged sci-fi aesthetic, inspired by the 1979 movie, is to die for. Literally, if you spend too long standing around admiring it.

Tom: I love the chunky bulkheads and spectacular lighting of the station. The Alien is still magnificent, of course, and it's still so refreshing to match wits with the huge, near-immortal Xenomorph from the first film. I think it overstays its welcome by a few hours, but that's a small complaint when the run up to the finale puts you through increasingly terrifying scenarios. Shout out to the Working Joes, the androids who give you something else to worry about when the Alien decides to go hunting elsewhere on the ship.

26. What Remains of Edith Finch 
Released 2017 | Last position 11

What remains of Edith Finch

(Image credit: Giant Sparrow)
Rachel: What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange, fantastical tales about the doomed Finch household. As the last living member, Edith has returned to the family home to discover her relative's hidden histories, exploring each of the family's many rooms to find out how each member met their unfortunate end. It's a first-person narrative adventure that tells surprisingly woeful vignettes in an artful and gentle way.

Andy K: This is the only game I love that I’ll never play again. One moment in the story hit me so hard that I don’t think I can go through it again, and so that original playthrough will remain my first and last encounter with the game. But I still think anyone who values story in games should play it, because it tells its tale of an eccentric family in a wonderfully clever, elegant way. The Finch household is an incredibly evocative place too, stuffed with secrets and subtle details that help flesh the story out.

Tom: There's something quite magical about Edith Finch's anthology of tragedies. It gets dark at times, but I came away strangely moved by the game's presentation of a strange family that lives in the weirdest house ever. The tag 'walking simulator' used to be an insult, but time and again we can see that it's a good format for storytelling. 

25. Rainbow Six: Siege
Released 2015 | Last position 16

Rainbow Six: Siege

(Image credit: Rainbow Six Siege)
Harry: Rainbow Six Siege is both complex and beautifully simple. On the surface, all you need to do is capture/defend your objective, so beginners can quickly grasp the aim of the game, but veterans with thousands of hours clocked can still find plenty of ways to improve all the way up to professional level. 

With guns that can end your round with one bullet and hundreds of tactical micro decisions needing to be made during its many intense moments, I often need half an hour to calm down after a session. Recent new operators and revamps to some of its labyrinthine maps have been strong, too, but the battle against toxicity and bugs isn't over. 

Evan: Ubisoft deserves praise for sustaining a game like Siege with continuous meaningful updates despite not being a studio with a ton of institutional experience making competitive multiplayer games. Now a five-year-old FPS, Ubi continues to disrupt Siege's meta with experimental new operators (Iana, one of my recent favorites, spawns a holographic copy of herself that she can pilot around) while still making a lot of time to renovate big (and often boring-but-important) systems and old maps, demonstrated again very recently. 

24. Persona 4 Golden
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

Persona 4 Golden

(Image credit: Atlus)
Robin: This iconic JRPG boasts all the usual tropes: dungeon crawls, turn-based battles, attacking and dethroning God, etc, but it’s in the mundane, not the supernatural, that it really grabs you. It’s got a wonderful sense of place, its Japanese countryside town utterly evocative and authentic as you progress through the seasons. What really sticks with you is its lovable cast of characters, a tight-knit crew of goofballs and misfits that form one of the most convincing and endearing friendship groups in games. 

Wes: Years before it was on PC I spent a good month playing Persona 4 in bed nearly every day, getting to know its great group of characters. The fanbase may overhype how truly interesting they all are, but the slow burn nature of Persona 4 lets you really live with them, and get to know them to a degree that few games can match, as you spend days just hanging out by the river talking, going shopping, or eating beef bowls. So many beef bowls. All the rest of the JRPG stuff is fun too, but really, Persona 4 is just a great teenage friendship simulator. 

23. Return of the Obra Dinn
Released 2018 | Last position 8

Return of the Obra Dinn

(Image credit: 3909)
Wes: There's no better feeling than noticing some tiny detail—could that really be a clue?—and being rewarded by Obra Dinn's enthusiastic burst of music when properly guessing how one of these sailors met their grisly end. Just pay attention to everyone's shirt, is all I'm saying.

Rachel: Lucas Pope's haunting detective game makes you witness things that have only existed in the gossip of sailors. Its bleached 1-bit visuals invite players to look a little closer before a chilling realisation sinks in. It's one of the best mysteries on PC, and if becoming an expert on all the different crew on a merchant ship from the 1800s sounds like fun, this is the game for you.

Phil: I love talking about Obra Dinn with other players—discovering the slightly different ways we all came to the same conclusions. It's a clear sign of mastery when a mystery lets you arrive at difficult revelations from a number of different directions.

22. Total War: Three Kingdoms
Released 2019 | Last position New entry 

Total War: Three Kingdoms

(Image credit: Creative Assembly)
Steven: Total War has explored several important historical periods, but none of them feel as fully realized as Three Kingdoms. That's because Three Kingdoms' emphasizes the characters that defined that era of Chinese history, making for a dramatic and fun strategy game with a lot of wonderful little flourishes and quirks. I love how factions are now defined by the personality of their leaders, like the conniving Cao Cao or the aging dignity of Liu Bao, and how that focus on personality also makes diplomacy actually matter over the course of a campaign. Instead of fighting faceless factions, you're sitting down with enemy generals with their own stories, motivations, and weaknesses, and it makes the battles feel all the more intense when they're the result of interpersonal conflict between warlords.

Fraser: Right out the gate, Three Kingdoms was already a strong contender for the best Total War game, and since launch Creative Assembly have only added more to make it stand apart from the rest of the series. Expansions have introduced new campaigns that slot neatly into the regular campaign, fleshing out the timeline with more events and factions without making it feel bloated. The phenomenal campaign is now even better, then, with a greater variety of starting scenarios and a bunch of new factions with unusual mechanics. Even without that, though, you won’t find a more polished or better looking Total War. 

21. Final Fantasy XIV
Released 2013 | Last position 28

Steven: If there's one MMO you should play in 2020, FF14 is it. The latest expansion uses years of careful character development and world building to deliver a dimension-spanning gut-punch that rivals the series' best, and I really enjoy how FF14 tells such a coherent yet expansive story. But FF14 is just a joy to play. It's classes are distinct and fun, and dungeons and bosses are so unique and well-crafted that I don't mind running them over and over again for new gear. 

Tom: This game properly has its claws in me now. As a fan of Final Fantasy, it's great to see old archetypes return—it even has its own version of Biggs and Wedge. It takes ages to get going, but when I started hitting the dungeons at level 20 I knew I was in for the long haul. The malleable class system is great too, and I admire the way the game doesn't overwhelm you with skills before you've learned the purpose of your class. As a tank I successfully pulled a green dragon off puddles of poisonous goop as my companions battered it into submission. I felt like a hero.

20. Half-Life: Alyx
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

Half-Life: Alyx

(Image credit: Valve)
Tyler: I don't like the horror aspects. I'm a wuss, and handling zombie corpses in VR makes me too nervous. Handling all other things with the Gravity Gloves, however, is fantastic. It's like you're Thor and everything is your hammer.

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Chris: Alyx doesn't really do anything groundbreaking when it comes to how you interact with the world in VR. It's interactions are super-satisfying, like Tyler said: using the grabbity gloves to pull things into your hands, reloading guns, examining objects. It all works great without feeling like anything particularly new. 

But where it's most impressive technically is how well it does locomotion and smooth movement. I've never had any real motion-sickness in VR, but I do get tired of it pretty quickly. I get headaches, I become hyper-aware of having controllers in my hands and a computer strapped to me face, and usually 30 minutes is as much as I can stand before I want to take off my headset for a break. I found Alyx so comfortable in VR that I had several sessions that lasted over two hours long, something I've never done in a VR game before. At no point did I feel like I needed a break or a breath. Whatever it does under the hood is incredibly impressive.

And that's excellent because it's also incredibly engrossing. I was skeptical a game sandwiched between Half-Life 1 and 2 could do much story-wise, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. Half-Life: Alyx completely invigorated a storyline I've been invested in for over 20 years with some genuinely thrilling revelations.

Emma: I suffer from motion sickness and I'm so grateful for the effort that Valve put in to make Alyx feel as comfortable as possible. As Chris mentions, it's so easy to sink a few hours into it without realising how long you've been playing. The story is incredible, and I'm excited to jump in for a second playthrough when the weather gets a little colder here in the UK—playing VR in this heat is horrible!  

19. Into the Breach
Released 2018 | Last position 6

Into the Breach

(Image credit: Subset Games)
Jody: Not even XCOM: Chimera Squad's missions are perfectly bite-sized like Into the Breach's snacky levels. Strategy games are usually life-devouring posture-killers. Not Into the Breach. Move mechs, trick giant insects into smacking into mountains, and you're done. One step closer to saving a world, time left to walk the dog.

Evan: Snacky, as you say, but surprisingly grim! Ben Prunty's music and the tiny word bubbles emerging from the fragile buildings you're charged to protect convey a mood much bleaker than their bits. Mechanically and narratively Into the Breach is a textbook example of what can be achieved with a less-is-more approach.

Phil: The way I play Into the Breach, it's almost like Sudoku for someone with a Steam account. I'll spend long minutes pondering a turn, staring at the screen while the real work plays out in my head. "If I move him there, I could… no, wait, because then… ah, but if…" It's a tactics game that tells you all of the terrible things that are about to happen, and lets you take the time to work out how to prevent them all. 

18. The Sims 4
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

The Sims 4

(Image credit: Electronic Arts)
Chris: It'll cost an arm and a leg to keep up with all the expensive add-ons, but there's simply no other game quite like The Sims series. Whether you play casually or devotedly, it remains an utterly absorbing, occasionally morbid, often hilarious dollhouse, person simulator, and story generator.

Katie Wickens: I know The Sims was originally designed as a middle-finger to consumerist culture and has now contorted into the very thing it despised, but I can't help getting sucked into the intricate slew of home and garden design features. The building cheats and extensive modding community make this game one of my all time favorites. So many stories to be woven, mysteries to be uncovered, crimes to be solved. This game has it all. Still, I’d wait for a sale before you spend your life savings on it.

Emma: I'm a long-time fan of the Sims, but I try to stop myself from playing it too often as it's ridiculously easy for me to become addicted to it all over again. One thing I'm still terrible at is looking after pets, though. My beautiful pink pugs always run away.

17. Apex Legends
Released 2019 | Last position 24

Apex Legends

(Image credit: EA, Respawn Entertainment)
Phil: For the longest time I thought battle royales weren't for me. Apex Legends changed that, by encouraging me not to hide away like a coward, but to embrace the speed, maneuverability and lethality of its design and go looking for a fight. I'm a convert—I've already logged 180 hours since March, and I won't be stopping anytime soon.

Jacob: There are few games I'd take in lieu of Titanfall 3, but Apex Legends is a worthy replacement. It completely reshaped my opinion of battle royales up until that point, which were often long drawn-out exercises in scavenging up until a rogue sniper sends you back to the lobby. Apex Legends offered fast-paced action, a tighter map (which breadcrumbs gear and points of interest any which way you go), team respawns, superb gunplay, an inventory system that doesn't suck—you name it, Apex Legends had it, and has been improving on ever since.

Emma: Apex Legends has become part of my daily routine. Every night after dinner I'll clock in to grind through a few more battle pass challenges. Each season has introduced viable new legends, as well as interesting changes to the map, such as the bunkers in Season 5. I'm also enjoying the fact that Respawn are continuing to drip feed the characters' backstories into the game, too. The week that Forge was announced before being brutally killed by Revenant felt like a dramatic, twisted soap opera, and I'm all for more drama.  

What's most impressive about Apex is how long it's managed to retain my attention for so long, and how every season feels like its best yet. Season 6 just introduced crafting, and it really helps to alleviate some of the boring downtime of other battle royales. I've also become a Rampart main for the time being, and have even gravitated towards entirely different weapons this season. I can't wait to see what Respawn adds next.
