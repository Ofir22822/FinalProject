Yakuza 0

(Image credit: Sega)
Jorge: You come to Yakuza 0 for the Japanese '80s crime drama, but you'll stay for the over-the-top fights and wholesome character moments as you try to improve the lives of the citizens of Kamurocho. Also, seeing the series' beloved protagonists, Kiryu and Majima, in their awkward 20s struggling to figure out what kind of men they want to be is surprisingly relatable.

Andy K: The origin story of Majima Goro, as told in Yakuza 0, is honestly one of the best storytelling experiences a game has ever given me. His early chapters, where he’s working as the manager of a cabaret club in Osaka, are incredible: particularly his introduction, where he deals with a drunk customer using nothing but extremely good manners, soundtracked by a swing band. You’ll know what I mean when you see it, and you should, because this is an exceptionally entertaining game set in a dense, vivid portrayal of 1980s Japan. It breakdances on the line between absurd and serious in a really masterful way, and it’s the perfect introduction to a truly one-of-a-kind series.

Phil: The series has slowly been making its way to PC—Remastered Collection when, Sega?—but, if you've never played one before, Yakuza 0 is the place to start. It's a prequel, which helps, but more importantly it's the absolute apex of the series' drama, humour and social commentary, embodying its '80s with singular dedication. What I'm saying is: the money flies out of people when you punch them.

Hitman 2

Fraser: You can kill someone with a homing suitcase. 

Phil: You can! And it's the reason Hitman 2 is one of the most satisfying stealth games around. Look behind the thematic window dressing of a stoic assassin causing trouble in a series of neighbourhoods and you'll realise that Hitman 2 is a procession of puzzle boxes built on rigidly consistent rules. You're rewarded for discovering and manipulating those rules—learning how the sandbox will react and tailoring your approach to exploit it. It's a rare and beautiful game where breaking your own sense of immersion makes for a more mechanically enjoyable experience.

Andy K: I love walking slowly through one of Hitman 2’s impossibly dense maps, looking for cracks in the security to infiltrate, disguises to change into, people to follow, and targets to kill. These moments, the calm before the storm, are what make the series special for me. The planning, the anticipation, and, naturally, the on-the-fly changes of plan as you make a mistake and chaos erupts around you. It also helps that the levels look so beautiful. IO Interactive’s environment designers are some of the best in the business, and Hitman 2 is a killer showcase for their talents. The Isle of Sgàil is a personal highlight: a crumbling old castle perched on a rain-battered island in the North Atlantic, playing host to a creepy secret society party straight out of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut.

14. Doom Eternal
Released 2020 | Last position New entry 

Doom Eternal

(Image credit: Bethesda)
Wes: Doom Eternal spikes my adrenaline so hard I'm exhausted after an hour. If you've ever pondered the videogame equivalent of slamming a 16 oz. Monster Energy, then juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle across a burning rope suspended over a hellmouth, well, here you go.

Harry: Doom Eternal's frantic relentlessness is exactly what I'm looking for in a shooter. Juggling resources and living every second on the edge of death is a great way to unwind and few other games require quite the same undivided, hysterical concentration. While Eternal didn't change enough to give it the impact the 2016 reboot did, it didn't really need to. That intoxicating cocktail of hardcore metal, intricate map design, and gruesomely cathartic glory kills is as exhilirating as ever, in necessarily short bursts.

James: Doom 2016 is still great! Go play that if you want to breathe between headshots, if you want to remain fully conscious and aware while ripping up demons and sticking it to the man (the man is hell). But Doom Eternal is a vastly different experience. Doom 2016 wants you to feel cool and sweat a bit. Doom Eternal kept me in a lizard-brained panic, balanced precariously between frenzy and despair, an FPS automaton of pure instinct for 15 damn hours. It's a painful, cleansing experience. Doom Eternal aged me.

Kentucky Route Zero

(Image credit: cardboard computer)
Rachel: Cardboard Computer took seven years to release all five episodes of Kentucky Route Zero, and yet it was worth the wait. This evocative adventure about the struggles of rural America are more relevant today than ever. Kentucky Route Zero is an anthology of stories from the road, tales of lore and mythos intertwined with the tough truths of working class folk. Miners, electricians and store clerks take centre stage telling stories of survival during economic hardship. The magical-realism enhances these tales and, as dreamlike as it can be, Kentucky Route Zero stays firmly grounded in respect for its characters. It's a powerful story that conjures a damning portrait of America and those who are forced to wander its lost highways. 

12. XCOM 2
Released 2016 | Last position 13

XCOM 2

(Image credit: 2K)
Wes: XCOM 2 sticks around year after year because it's such an endlessly flexible sandbox, but the Chosen, stars of its must-have expansion, really make it for me. They're nasty, vengeful alien commandos who show up to make your life hell time and again. They made me miserable, but in return I tracked them to their hideouts and relished the chance to finish them off after so much torment. Evil's just more fun to fight when it has a face you can punch.

Robin: I reviewed XCOM 2 back when it came out, and honestly I’ve never really stopped playing it. All its different layers of randomness—especially with the expansion and some choice mods—just make it endlessly replayable for me. It’s this big, intricate, shifting puzzle that I never get tired of unpicking. 

11. Planescape: Torment
Released 1999 | Last position New entry 

Planescape Torment

(Image credit: Beamdog)
Jody: I first played Dungeons & Dragons in the 1990s, before it got cool or had rules that were good. Even then Planescape was a wildly imaginative setting—a multiversal city run by squabbling philosophy gangs. Torment takes that setting and emphasises its urban grottiness, with magic tattoos instead of platemail and charms made of flies.

The heroes are scuffed-up too. There's a thief who is part-demon and voiced by Sheena Easton, a pyromancer who is punished for lighting fires with eternally burning skin, and you, an amnesiac corpseman who wakes up in a morgue. D&D can be fun when it's elves and dwarves, but it's even better when you're a man who drinks embalming fluid instead of healing potions.


10. Titanfall 2

Titanfall 2

(Image credit: Respawn Entertainment)
Robin: The most creative shooter campaign in years, plus a wonderfully dramatic multiplayer offering. Now that it’s finally on Steam, you’ve really got no excuse not to pick it up. If any game deserves a second life, it’s this one. 

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Harry: I'll take Robin's word for it on the multiplayer, but the campaign is undoubtedly the best ever in a shooter, with more imagination in single levels than entire videogames: The timeline-tearing Effect and Cause level is rightly eulogised, but the way the game is willing to just bin excellent ideas like this, then follow it up with something better, is extraordinary. Like many, I only played it through word-of-mouth, so here's a recommendation: play it, you won't regret it.

9. Outer Wilds
Released 2019 | Last position 20

Outer Wilds

(Image credit: Mobius Digital)
Steven: Outer Wilds made me feel a kind of childlike wonder at the cosmos that I haven't felt in a long time. Each planet is a wonderful scientific enigma that slowly reveals a tragic and poignant story about our place in the universe. It's charming, endlessly inventive, and, despite a frustrating final puzzle, one of the most consistently incredible indie games I've ever played. While games like Elite Dangerous try to recreate the joy of discovery by emulating an entire galaxy, The Outer Wilds packs it all into a single solar system trapped in a 20-minute time loop. Play this game.

Robin: So glad we pushed this higher this year. An absolutely exquisite game. 

8. Hollow Knight
Released 2017 | Last position 7 

Hollow Knight

(Image credit: Team Cherry)
Rachel: Team Cherry's gorgeously gloomy subterranean world is like no other. The depth that has gone into building its bug civilization is incredibly detailed, but also completely sealed away within the dreams and memories of the characters. Tales of fallen heroes, deranged kings, and wrathful gods are hidden in every corner. Hollow Knight is a tough action adventure, but wanting to know more about this incredible, ruined kingdom kept pushing me forward.

James: Hollow Knight is still the best Metroid game. Nintendo, cancel the rest of your 2D Metroid plans, mainline that Prime stuff, because Team Cherry has it handled. We're good. No other 2D adventure has quite so much tucked away, a constant unfurling of scope, character, and history. Bring on Silksong. 

7. Dishonored 2
Released 2016 | Last position 5

Dishonored 2

(Image credit: Arkane Studios)
Fraser: No game has levels like Dishonored 2. Most of them would be the high point anywhere else. When you reach the Clockwork Mansion, you think it's probably peaked, with its elaborate transforming rooms and terrifying mechanical constructs, but then a few missions later you hit A Crack in the Slab, letting you explore a mansion in both the past and present, creatively altering the timeline to complete your mission. Picking apart their quirks and trying to figure out how to break the patterns of the guards requires a lot of lateral thinking, but thankfully you've usually got a lot of nifty tricks up your sleeve, turning you into more of a trickster god than an assassin.

Tom: I worried that the move to Karnaca would hurt the game, as Dunwall was so evocative in game one. I needn't have. Though the game takes place in the sunshine of a coastal southern town, it's rife with corruption and swarming with horrible plague flies. I love everything I look at in this game, whether it's a cool desk lamp, or a shutte suspended on rails above the city. Emily is a great addition as well. Abilities like Domino—which pairs enemies together so if you kick one they all get kicked—are genius. 

6. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
Released 2019 | Last position 3

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

(Image credit: From Software)
Harry: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice isn't just one of the finest, tightest, sharpest action games, it's also one of the best rhythm games you can play on PC right now. Imagining each flourish of an enemy sword as a node on an approaching fretboard is a useful way of parrying and dodging your way through the immaculately dark world of Sengoku-era Japan. As is customary from FromSoftware by now, the combat is note-perfect, too, making the punishingly rewarding learning curve feel as firm, and fair, as ever. 

Tom: FromSoftware can do no wrong at the moment. Sekiro features the best combat system the developer has made yet. The block-and-parry system produces fights that look as though they have been choreographed, and there are some outstanding bosses.

Wes: I've only become obsessed with Sekiro in mid-2020, but damn, what a game. It retains just enough of the Souls flavor and intricate level design while being a much more focused action game. It's the proper Ninja Gaiden sequel I've wanted for more than a decade. 

5. Slay the Spire
Released 2019 | Last position 4

Slay the Spire

(Image credit: Mega Crit Games)
Tyler: Still the best roguelike deckbuilder, despite a couple of challengers. You'll know you're hooked after the first time you spend a full minute deciding whether to click on a campfire or a shop. 

Cyber Monday deals: see all the best offers right now!
Robin: In the years since its Early Access release, I don’t think there’s any game I’ve played as much as Slay the Spire. The decks you build as you play feel like intricate engines—and there’s always some new configuration of parts to try.

Wes: Shout out to Electrodynamics, the card that turns my beloved android Defect into a lightning bolt-casting murder machine. It always makes me feel unstoppable, right up until the wrong boss fight ruins my night. But there's always time for another run…

Evan: I've got 160 hours in Slay, but in the past month I've switched allegiances entirely to Monster Train, a roguelike deckbuilder that cribs a lot of Slay's template but draws way more inspiration from Magic: The Gathering with its emphasis on creature summoning and color combinations. Bonus: you fill a train with a bunch of demons so you can attack and dethrone god. Double bonus: one of the deck types is a race of Victorian Candle People who you melt down (read: kill) in order to reincarnate them as stronger versions of themselves. It's exciting that Slay the Spire has already sparked a burgeoning subgenre. 

4. The Witcher 3
Released 2015 | Last position 2

The Witcher 3

(Image credit: CD Projekt Red)
Robin: Such a spectacular, ambitious achievement of an RPG world that it really hasn’t aged much at all. Still an absolute pleasure to explore, and still home to some of the best writing and characters the genre’s ever seen. Finish the 100+ hour main game, and your reward is two expansions that are even better. Hearts of Stone in particular is easily my favourite DLC of all time.

Andy K: For me, the magic of The Witcher 3 lies in its side quests. When you pluck an innocuous-sounding bounty from a village notice board, you never know what kind of wild story you're about to get tangled up in. Almost every quest feels weighty and worthwhile, with memorable, unpredictable stories inspired by some of the strangest deep cuts from Eastern European folklore.

Wes: Is it redundant to praise The Witcher 3, at this point? Three of the best games on PC are RPGs, now, and The Witcher 3 is the oldest of them. But it's also the grandest and the most immersive, the one with voice acting and motion capture that sucks you in and makes you feel like you're playing through a proper fantasy epic. As Andy says, its speciality is making those little side stories interesting. No RPG hero has ever felt as much like a true working citizen of their world than Geralt. 

3. Red Dead Redemption 2
Released 2019 | Last position New entry 

Red Dead Redemption 2

(Image credit: Rockstar Games)
Chris: Easily my favorite game of 2019, checking off all the boxes on my internal wishlist: beautiful and incredibly detailed open world, lots of stuff to do but typically not much pressure to do any of it until I was ready, and believable characters I felt invested in. Many of the missions in the second half felt a bit same-y, but since missions were spaced out over the leisurely 100 or so hours I played it didn't bother me too much. It's a world I'll keep coming back to for years.

Andy K: Rockstar's evocative slice of the American West is the only open world that feels genuinely wild and natural to me. They really captured something about nature that seems to have eluded other studios, which makes for a setting that feels wonderfully real as you explore its plains, peaks, and valleys on horseback.

2. Divinity: Original Sin 2 
Released 2017 | Last position 1

Divinity: Original Sin 2

(Image credit: Larian Studios)
Robin: I love that Original Sin 2 applies the same sense of choice and freedom that you find in its sprawling, branching story to its systems-driven combat. Interweaving elemental effects—expanded hugely from the already ambitious first game—turn every fight into an exercise in controlled chaos. 

Teleport that oil barrel onto an enemy’s head to crack it open, then set it alight with a fire spell. Curse the fire to make it unextinguishable. Summon rain to create puddles across the battlefield, then a chill wind to freeze them—or electrify them with lightning. Then heat it back up to turn it into a line-of-sight blocking steam cloud to protect your back line, before your warrior leaps over to cause havoc. 

Combat is its own sandbox, with endless opportunities to experiment and prove how clever you are—or for things to go spectacularly wrong in hilarious fashion. It doesn’t feel like just something you do between conversations, or a way to show off your latest stat upgrade. It’s a seamless continuation of the game’s anarchic philosophy, and just a fantastically fun tactical challenge in its own right.

Fraser: I dig it so much that I’ve started a new game even though Baldur’s Gate 3 is coming soon, at least to Early Access. And why not? Playing with different characters and builds means I get to experience all the best bits again from a different perspective. Now I’m a dickhead lizard who keeps demanding people make me lunch. And I’ve got a new friend, a squirrel riding a cat skeleton, along with a bunch of other additions and official mods that have sprouted since launch. It’s still a brilliant, free-wheeling RPG and sports one of the all-time best combat systems, and after a slew of updates it’s currently the best it’s ever been. 

Jacob: That every single character in a 120+ hour RPG has been fully voiced by an actor should be proof enough that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is worth your time. The level of detail in this game, and the willingness to let the player enjoy it as they see fit, far surpasses anything else I've experienced.

Tyler: There's a sad quest about dogs that you can only do if you know how to speak to animals. You can rip off people's faces and wear them to disguise that you're a skeleton. You can accidentally finish quests before an NPC explains them to you, just because you stumbled onto them. Divinity: Original Sin 2 feels much more like playing with a creative and clever DM than most modern RPGs, especially the sort that lays much of its choice in rude or nice dialogue options. 

And as has been mentioned, the turn-based combat is great, in part just because it's turn-based, as it should be. (Sorry if you like it, but real-time-with-pause can bite me. I'm very thankful that Larian is developing Baldur's Gate 3, because it means I might actually enjoy a D&D game for once.)

1. Disco Elysium
Released 2019 | Last position New entry 

Disco Elysium

(Image credit: ZA/UM)
Robin: I struggle to think of a game that has more radically changed how I think about a genre. Disco Elysium breaks down the RPG, turns it upside down, slaps it in the face, and then takes it to a bar to get hammered with it. Despite an old school isometric perspective, it couldn’t be more willing to dump dry old tropes and mess with the ones it keeps, to the point that even much larger, more fully-featured RPGs seem oddly unambitious, and even stagnant, by comparison.

Jody: Of all the bold things Disco Elysium does, my favourite is that it says videogames can be political and all the better for it. It starts out cynical about politics ("It's basically all just evil apes dukin' it out on a giant ball" is a good line), and constantly points out the flaws of every ideology including ideology-less centrism, but it builds from there to a point—that politics is messy and confusing but also necessary, that communities should take care of their own most vulnerable members, and that even when it hides behind labels like 'traditionalism' and 'nationalism' fascism can go and do one. It makes other RPGs, especially ones that try to present both sides of every argument even when one side is in favour of indentured servitude, seem wishy-washy and cowardly.

James: I punched a kid in the face to earn his respect and it completely changed the ending. That's an RPG, baby. 

Fraser: Disco Elysium lingers long after it's over. It poses a barrage of questions and constantly challenges with its themes of revolution, nationalism, morality—a kaleidoscope of ideologies all being presented before the game tears them down. Every character seems to have a manifesto, and the game itself almost serves as a manifesto for the future of RPGs, or at least ZA/UM's vision for it.

It rips out so many tired RPG cliches and swaps world-shattering stakes for an introspective exploration of a man utterly failing to hold it together. It grabs the genre by the shoulders and shouts "You don't need elves or fights or scenery-chewing villains!" And even when it uses conventional stuff like skill checks, it reinvents the whole system. Skills have personalities. They talk to you. They tell you secrets about the city or offer insights into crime scenes.

Playing other RPGs, I just keep thinking about Disco Elysium. It makes most of them seem cautious and set in their ways, and the constant recycling of systems that have, in some cases, barely changed in decades seems less forgivable now that there's this much more appealing alternative. It's exciting, and hopefully it will spur other designers into letting go of all the RPG clutter.

Andy K: I knew Disco Elysium was special from pretty much the moment I started playing it for our review—but I didn't bank on it permanently altering my expectations for an entire genre. The freedom you have to shape the protagonist, through the things you say and do, is quite extraordinary. He's a gross, wet ball of clay, and by the end of the game it really does feel like you've moulded him into something distinctly yours. I'm also amazed whenever I play how developer ZA/UM seems to constantly be two steps ahead of me, with some kind of reward or pay-off, even if it's a small one, for any harebrained idea I happen to dream up. The only really bad thing I have to say about Disco Elysium is that it's ruined all other RPGs for me. If only they were all this improbably deep.

Jacob: If I asked you to describe the worst hangover you've ever experienced, it wouldn't hold a candle to the one you're about to live out in Disco Elysium.

Wes: The writing! I want to bathe in these words. There's a joyous reverence shimmering off every sentence in Disco Elysium. It feels so alive with its mission to prove that words alone can make a masterpiece. Turns out they can.

Plenty of RPGs have great writing. Disco Elysium goes out of its way, though, to truly elevate its text. Tremendous care went into the presentation—the font, the way text unfurls, the visual effects when you pass or fail a skill check—to keep you glued to these words. Disco turns traditional RPG skills into luscious conversations, with each voice in your head adding color, clarity, and humor to a scene far more effectively than graphics could. It's a thousand times more interesting and creative than a companion in a BioWare-style RPG chiming in with an opinion on your latest binary decision.

I love games that truly feel like they were made by individual human beings, and it's staggering that every word, in a game of this scope, can feel so personal.

Personal Picks
We love many more games than we can fit onto one list, so here the PC Gamer team has spotlighted a few of their favorites that didn't make the cut.

James Davenport: Hylics 2
Hylics 2

(Image credit: Mason Lindroth)
As a Wayne of some importance, it's up to you to stop the reconstitution of Gibby so everyone can get back to slapping bugs. I'm still not sure what Hylics 2 is about, but that's kind of OK. An absurdist RPG made of 3D-scanned clay models, it plays like a long-lost RPG from the 1970s. 

Harry Shepherd: Journey
Journey

(Image credit: Thatgamecompany)
thatgamecompany's wordless wonder has long been my favourite videogame, and last year it finally found its definitive home on PC. Enhanced by a majestic score from Austin Wintory, this entrancing two-hour epic sees you floating over undulating sand dunes and sweeping through dank caves to reach a twinkling mountain peak. Pint-sized perfection.

Phil Savage: Guild Wars 2
Guild Wars 2

(Image credit: ArenaNet)
Its combat is punchy and satisfying, its community is helpful and engaged, and its approach to levelling makes it easy to get involved in any of its regular updates—even if you haven't played for years. So many live service games would be improved if they took some inspiration from Guild Wars 2's model.

Rachel Watts: If Found...
If Found...

(Image credit: Annapurna Interactive)
Dreamfeel's coming-of-age visual novel has both beautiful and gut-wrenching authenticity. It follows a trans woman's return to her Irish hometown during the '90s, having to deal with the troubles of being a young queer adult. It's an ethereal story of awkward crushes, punk concerts, and a black hole that threatens to destroy reality.

Chris Livingston: West of Loathing
West of Loathing

(Image credit: Asymmetric)
RDR2 isn't the only open world cowboy game on PC. West of Loathing's art may just be simple stick figures, but the writing is brilliant and it's overstuffed with jokes. I played long after I'd finished the RPG's main quest, just to make sure I'd found every last scrap of humor.

Robin Valentine: Mortal Kombat 11
Mortal Kombat 11

(Image credit: Warner Bros.)
Not just the only fighting game with a genuinely good story campaign, but for my money the most accessible entry into the genre there’s ever been. Easy combos, a slower pace, and a whole suite of fantastic tutorials make this a gory showdown that anyone can enjoy. Err, unless you’ve got a weak stomach. 

Andy Kelly: L.A. Noire
L.A. Noire

Rockstar's most divisive game is also one of my favourites. This lavish replica of 1940s Los Angeles is a dream for anyone who's ever watched a film noir or read a Raymond Chandler novel and wished they could be there. And a cast of genuinely great actors (including several familiar faces from Mad Men) really brings the story to life.

Jacob Ridley: Florence
Florence

Florence is a snapshot of falling in, and drifting out of, love. It's delivered through simple interactions—each puzzle is intrinsically tied to Florence's thoughts and feelings. But even beyond its affirming story, Florence offers a vibrant art style brought to life by a wonderful soundtrack filled to the brim with light and intricate piano and cello motifs.

Alan Dexter: Magic the Gathering: Arena 
Magic the Gathering: Arena

What's that? MTG Arena isn't on the list? An oversight surely. If you want to exercise your grey matter there isn't a game that comes close. I've been playing the cardboard version for over 20 years and this is the best digital version by a country mile. The fact I still play daily is surely all the recommendation needed. And no, you don't need to drop any cash on it to enjoy it.  

Fraser Brown: The Beginner's Guide
The Beginner's Guide

(Image credit: Everything Unlimited Ltd)
An analysis of some levels from the perspective of a designer and fan, The Beginner's guide is a fascinating exploration of game design that becomes something so much more. It's insightful and uncomfortable and—actually, I'm going to leave it there. It's brilliant and you should find out for yourself. 

Wes Fenlon: Satisfactory
Satisfactory

It's really all in the name. Even incomplete in Early Access, this factory building sim is so damn satisfying in how it lets you optimize designs, then sit back and watch your elaborate construction whir with life. God I love building things that build things that build things that build...

Dave James: Football Manager
Football Manager

There is always a longterm FM career going on my home PC, and stored in the cloud so I can access whenever, from wherever. It's my comfort, my happy place, even when it's making me more angry than a bunch of little computer people have any right to. It's also the best RPG going. Fight me.

Jody Macgregor: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc
Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc

(Image credit: spike)
The best game inspired by the movie Battle Royale is an extended parody of Phoenix Wright where gifted kids are trapped by a robot bear (just roll with it), and forced to murder each other. Only the killer who evades guilt in a class trial goes free. It's a comedy.

Tom Senior: Mortal Shell
Mortal Shell

(Image credit: Playstack)
Dark Souls is an enigmatic game, but the soulslike Mortal Shell manages to be even more obscure. You play a pale spirit who can occupy the forms of four fallen warriors, each with their own skills and strange backstories. Fantastic combat and the innovative Shell system sets it apart from the games that inspired it.
