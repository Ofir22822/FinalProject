Not for Little Kids
Spellbreak is a great game for kids ages 10+. There is no blood, nor too much violence. The violence in the game includes casting spells at one another, and upon contact, there is no blood/gore. The game is fast paced, so I would recommend it for 10+. The game is a battle royale game, and is played with real people. Definitely a good game for kids 10+.

Great game!
A great, fun game that I just got. Easy to learn, and almost no violence.
No gore, the game doesn't even mention the word "kill". When "exiled" you just disappear.

So Frustrating
It never explains how to play, there are no hints, this game is pretty bad!

Better than J-stars! You don’t have to be an anime fan to enjoy!
This game is very good. The story has a strong plot, and it the graphics are Stunning! Yes it is a bit violent but the only thing that is kinda bad is the MILD blood and the armor breaks. (Which makes most male characters almost shirtless and for Luffy if he gets a full armor break he is completely shirtless but still has his pants. But anyways this game is good! Just watch out for a bit of violence but that doesn’t matter because it is rated T for Teen anyways.

Good Fighting Game for Anime Fans
OK, this is a fighting game based on anime , which means that there's gonna be some sexual content. Good thing is, it's aimed for younger ages. It's a Bandai Namco game, so it has a Tekken 7 look. One Piece character Boa Hancock does show some skin if she gets beat up pretty bad. Also, there are some sexual references in the dialogue, but they aren't too blatant. Anyway, if you like anime, there is a good chance that you will like Jump Force.

not as bad as everyone says it is elsewhere
now jump force does get quite a bit repetitive at times, but thats even better for young children. the game is broken but there is a lot of room to improve. as for parents' concerns, you shouldn't have to worry unless you think that some animated violence (with little to no blood or gore) is rotting your child's mind. i'm not 100% sure if there is any language but its all japanese with english subtitles so who cares? oh and pretty easy to play but no one wants to play with you if you go down the easy gameplay route (aka press every button\key or S P A M M I N G).

Pretty good game
It's a pretty good game, in my opinion, I got this video game for my cousin who's 9 years old he said he absolutely loves anime like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

Very Good But Up To You!
Definitely a great game but i think it’s up to how mature your child mentally is...

Really CSM??
This game is fine for all ages Idk why they say you need to be 9. The only reason I'm saying 5+ is because the controlls can take a while to master but otherwise it's fine

They keep marching out the same mightily-flawed money-hungry game hoping for the same results.
The game series has been in a massive decline since their last good edition (Madden 12). They have completely neglected to update franchise mode, as they focus on MUT -- their means of extracting money from children via their parents' credit cards

The game straight sucks
Do not buy unless you enjoy gambling on MUT packs.

Nowhere near as graphic as the show.
Very mild; violence has no visual detail or brutal impact and is rarely the objective. No M-rated content aside from some swearing. Very teen friendly.
age 8+ 
Great tactical combat, though it suffers from the occasional difficulty spike
This game thoroughly surprised me. As someone who isn't particularly a fan of this genre, I was expecting a boring, dry tactical game, but was surprised to find a rich, engaging tactical rpg that actually hooked me. It does suffer from the occasional unseen difficulty spike but the tactical combat is just so much fun that it's always satisfying and almost never frustrating to overcome those difficulty spikes. I Highly recommend it.
Its ok...
it was fine to play but got a bit boring and you just die all the time to spiders that are 3x as big as you so if you child doesn't like spiders or insects I would not recommend this game. But it is fun with friends.
age 9+ 
Fine for kids 9 up
All its about is a kid who's got shrunk and they have to survive in a back yard, no swearing, there are spiders and bugs you have to survive to but its just an entertaining game, there is some science stuff you have to do so that's why I recommend 9 up.
age 12+ 
Game with an Great idea, but brought down by the genre and execution
This game had great potential, that alone brings it to 2 stars, but I cant put it higher because the genre is so washed down (Battle Royale) that it feels repetitive. It also doesn't help the same company (Ubisoft) who had towers. Overall, if it was a different company and a team shooter, then it would be 4 stars, but that is an "if". This is my "Hot Take".

Gets old fast
No variety in weapons or hacks and map is surprisingly bland. Not original and actually quite the opposite of what common sense said. It has some style in the animation and environment but no substance.

My review for Hyper Scape
This game is so much fun! Me and my son play it all the time it is not addicting and i don't see any blood or gore the guns are unrealistic and look like toys. I recommend this game to anyone above the age of 9.

Amazing game great for kids
My son loves this game, there’s no blood and no realistic guns it’s perfect for kids just getting into games.
age 8+ 
An interesting story in an interesting world.
Game aimed at teenagers. Brutality directed against machines and not people (most). There is no blood or nudity. The story may be too difficult for younger players but there are many side activities (hunting machines using their weak points). This is a well balanced game. We recommend that, my son is 8 years old and is doing well on an easy level. We played Rime, Uravel and Last Guardian earlier.

Horizon age rating
I think this game is fine for 10 and over pretty much no violence. Great story line.
