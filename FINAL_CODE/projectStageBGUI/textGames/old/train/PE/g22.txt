Fine for kids 9 up
All its about is a kid who's got shrunk and they have to survive in a back yard, no swearing, there are spiders and bugs you have to survive to but its just an entertaining game, there is some science stuff you have to do so that's why I recommend 9 up.

Its ok...
it was fine to play but got a bit boring and you just die all the time to spiders that are 3x as big as you so if you child doesn't like spiders or insects I would not recommend this game. But it is fun with friends.

A great game to play... As long as the kids are not around.
I have played the game and I absolutely loved the concept. Its game mechanics were spectacular and honestly I liked the puzzles. However I recommend not playing this in front of children as this game is extremely violent. There has been no dialogue as far as I know (mainly screams of pain and shrieks of fear). But there is a lot of brutality.

Just amazing, the 8-bit-ish gore is just so good.
So ngl, but its just sooooo amazing. This isnt like your average horror game. Its like Alien Vs Predator but better and its 8-bits. The graphics are so smooth and its very easy to learn the controls. You just gotta play it. I just love the gore and horror. 100 stars out of .0001. Theres just gore, monsters(you), and horror.

This is not for Children
There is a sequence where the monster slowly consumes someone and you can hear crunching of their bones and blood, they scream very shrill and can be VERY disturbing, just do not get this game.
 
Fun, good looking game with very few flaws
I, personally, like this game. I know that there are going to be elitists telling you how it "isnt as good as the first two" but they're wrong. Its a very good game thats easy to play, granted you need to know how to read, but the difficulty on the puzzles spikes at autumn mountain. I give it a four stars for a few reasons: the main one being that there isnt as much music as any of the other games(but the music this DOES have is amazing), and the story is kinda meh. Then again, im used to love, betrayals, and prophesy in my paper mario games. (They also didnt fix the "too many toads" issue very well, but its i step up)
TL;DR: Fun, bright game with puzzles that get hard at the the second world thats fun for kids

Good, but sad and hard
I think this game is best for kids fourteen and up. The reason for this is because the battle systems are based on puzzle solving. I am 14 myself and even my mom had a hard time with it. Another thing is death. One character, who I had really bonded with, dies. I won’t spoil who it is, but it was really sad for me and out of place. If your child tends to grow attached to fictional characters, like me, then proceed with extreme caution because it will rip your heart to shreds. The art style is fantastic, the storyline is intriguing, and the game itself is adorable. I think besides the hard puzzles and sad moments, this game is great and I would recommend it, but not for kids who can be traumatized by a character’s death.

This Game is Good, But Sad!
I enjoyed playing this game, though there are incorporations of shrines involved and VERY sad parts involving character deaths. Going into the “shrines”, Mario understands that there will be a boss to fight at the end, and there is absolutely NO requirement of worship from Mario. The first “Vellumental” temple is basically just a mock-tourist attraction, and all they want you to do is pay money to the koopa troopas running it. The biggest complaint I have is that (do not read further if you don’t like spoiler alerts) the beloved Bobby the Bob-omb sacrifices himself by blowing up a huge boulder trapping one character. Also at the very end, the supporting character, Olivia, dies. I was shocked with the death in this game, though nothing is gory or detailed; everything is classic Mario cartoon-ish. Over all, it was worth playing and I would recommend it for children in an older crowd.

Annoying sometimes
Its a pretty good game but later on you will discover that when your low on HP then the edges of the screen flash red and its SUPER annoying though there is a a part where (SPOILER ALERT) where Bobby who is the bomb-OMB sacrificed himself to save Olivia from a rock other then that its OK but annoying sometimes.

Fun turn based RPG with a nice ring system.
Sure, some of the puzzles can be stupid,I thought that finding toads is kinda worthless and the new villain isn't very interesting,but...
This game also has a ring system which adds an element of pizzazz to the battles,solid humor, great visuals, memorable music and fun boss fights.
Know that while this game isn't exactly vulgar,there are a few sad scenes in addition to the cartoon violence.
There are also a few slightly risque scenes with Birdo, and the battle system might confuse younger kids.
Eitherway, I think that this game is worth a shot and it's also probably the only Paper Mario game i'll EVER play.

(Spoiler Warning) Paper Mario, The Origami King Review!
This game, at least in my opinion, is pretty good! Sure, it might not be AS good as the first 3 games in the series, but it makes that up in charm. Sure Nintendo with the more recent Paper Mario games have been pushing an avalanche of Toads upon long time fans...... and a lot of the fans hate the absence of unique characters, but remember, Nintendo is just trying to take the series in fun new directions! Sure, they failed pretty hard sometimes :cough cough: Sticker Star.... But this game is a huge step up from..... that game...... The story of the game is a bit different than your typical Mario game, but other than that, it's as barebones as it can go... Peach's castle has been taken over by Origami and its Mario's job to save it! But during that barebones story there are some truly heartfelt AND heart wrenching moments..... like Bobby's death.... I finished the game in about 4 days, but that's because I am an addict... if you're a normal person it should take you about 3 weeks to finish it... Well, that's all for now, I hope if you get the game you enjoy it, Adios!

Surprisingly mature themes
I won't retread ground by other reviews, but one very surprising thing was that a character literally sacrifices themselves (to the death) for another character. I was playing with my 4yo in the room and we were both pretty upset (at the character's loss, not Nintendo specifically). One other thing to note for young children (if everything else is fine with you) is that it is a reading heavy game, so a reader chaperone will be needed at some point.

Good game but...
I was surprised by the spiritual elements of the game. Since when does a Mario game talk about deities and idols? I would definitely use caution with that aspect of the game, I felt like it was a sneaky/cheeky way of normalizing idolatry. I also agree with the other review here that the character having to sacrifice himself to save another character, while noble, could be very upsetting to young kids. Not trying to spoil the ending but a similar situation takes place at the end of the game as well. I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game and finding all of the trophies and treasures was definitely a challenge, so for the game itself I give it 3 stars, but it lost 2 because of the spiritualism and sad parts, because who wants to play a game that's sad???
 
Takes my breath away
This games takes my breath away everyime I play. Beautiful scenery with a great combat system is the perfect pair. The developers really outdid themselves and have nailed this game down to the smallest details. It's moderately violent, death is part of the game though, yet it is in no way excessive and the blood can be turned off. I don't usually write reviews but this game definitely deserves one. On point.

There is a setting to turn off blood. This does not apply to cutscenes and scenery, but it gets rid of blood splattering with every cut.

A WORK OF ART
Amazing game.Sucker Punch started the ps4 era and ended it with a swan song with ghost of tsushima. A captivating and heartfelt story.The gameplay is filled with so many abilities and the skill tree is just fascinating with three modes.The emotional beats connecting jin to his allies and his uncle. The mongols invasion of the island offers a breath of fresh air to the open world genre.The mythical quest are so much fun and helps to deepen the lore of the game.Chasing foxes to their dens.The graphics are just plain amazing especially playing on the old generation.The particles are just amazing from dense flower fields to the burning towns you can see the amazing parties details.The amount of flower and leave details is simply stunning. Cannot recommend enough. This really makes you feel in feudal Japan.The team at Sucker Punch went above and beyond for the photo mode with plenty of features and options such as depth of field or grain not to men ion the awesome black and white kirusawa mode.A must buy

A masterpiece
Honestly the game is just a beautiful masterpiece. It makes you think about what your doing and it gives you a choice (most of the time) to be honorable or not. Blood can be turned off of your unsure about it. But the game is just so aesthetically please omg you would want your kids to have it

It should not have an m rating
The main character Jin is a great person and everything he does is because of his code. In the game there is a mode in settings to turn off blood which makes it a lot less violent.

Brutal video game is yet the BEST
M: intense violence, bloody images and language.
 
Beautiful and Bloody, Great for Teens
The game has a stunning display of Japanese landscapes in a wonderfully recreated historical setting. The game has frequent violence with swords, bows, etc., with splattering blood, bodies that slowly collapse, and more intense cutscenes. However, the third person camera disconnects the player from the action, and the blood and combat isn't as bad as most shooters, and can be turned off if it's too much. The game has a great historical setting, and can be educational to teens who don't know much about japanese history, although it shouldn't supplement real education. The ideals and perseverance of the characters also present good role models for kids. Overall, the game is great and good for younger teens and up.

A Little blood but not to bad
Ghost of Tsushima is one of the most amazing games out there. It has a beautiful story with the best looking visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Other than gore this game doesn’t really need a age limit. If your worried about gore than you can turn it off in the options. This doesn’t exclude cutscenes though so be careful for those. In all this game is worth the money and it is definitely lower than 16+ Age limit

Amazing, but violent game
This game is extremely amazing, and was a good end to the ps4. Some things that you should know is that the game is extremely violent, but you can turn blood off. The other big problem I had is that whenever you go to these hot springs you see Jin’s (the main protagonist) butt. It doesn’t show anything else though. This game also has a very mature story that honestly nearly made me cry. The story is so compelling, talking about tradition v.r new techniques, honor v.r winning. Swearing is non existent, and the only swear I can think of is during the tutorial where you hear one of your friends whilst escaping and sneaking around say the s word. Occasionally they say some unfavorable words, but they are not super heavy words. One thing to note is that one character sells alcohol, but other than that no use of drugs or alcohol. Overall an amazing and beautiful games. One of my personal favorite ones. Also the controls are a bit weird to get used to, but it is not the hardest game.

Beautiful historical game!
I think that people must learn the history of battles in the past and know how it all came together. I’ve played only the first part of the game (INTRO) and it had a lot of positive messages like honor, courage and etc. The game taught you to be strong and control your emotions. I feel that Sucker Punch took a big leap on making this game and they deserve a lot for this game. They have respected Japanese culture in Tsushima and showed there history and how they fought in the war. Overall I think that a 15 year old would understand more and take the game seriously because if a 11 year old would play this game he wouldn’t truly understand this game. *THIS IS JUST MY OPINION*

It’s A Great Game..
It’s a great game. It really is. It has a couple moments of cussing, it has blood (which can be turned off in settings) but overall it’s really not he worst thing in the world. It has a great story. I say it’s about 11+.. I say this because an 8 or 9 year old does not really need to know about people invading a place and killing people .. because their eight and nine. A ten year old might understand a bit better, but it really depends on the 10 year old. My little brother is 10 years old.. and he is allowed to play the game. He knows he should never do anything that is showcased in the game because it is not okay to do in real life.. or in any way appropriate. So again, if you trust your younger kids to not make rash decisions.. go for it.

Beautiful game with Great Combat
This game looks beautiful. And I'm saying this based on owning a ps4 slim. At first I was unaware that you could turn of blood so I experienced some discomfort with the sheer levels of gore and intensity. Without blood the game would probably be PEGI 16 however some cut scenes are brutal. However take my review with a grain of salt as so far I have only played the 1st Chapter.

Fun game and has some violence
This is a really fun game it has some violence but it’s none that hasn’t been seen in some marvel movies. You can turn off blood in the settings. There are hot springs where Jin enters bare butt but it’s for only a second. It has a very good message about honor and family. If they have played any Call of Duty’s or battlefield games they should be fine.

Sucker Punch Productions new open world contains: deep story and samurai action
Ghost of Tsushima is an exciting new IP by Sucker Punch Productions. It is a vast open world set in feudal Japan. You play as a samurai with the thirst of revenge. You have two playstyles: The Samurai (combat focused), and The Ghost (Stealth based). The story is well written and presented.

Violence is frequent. Swords and sharp blades are used in the action. Players can quickly end duels with a quick strike to enemies, sending a debris of blood flying into the air. Characters are covered in blood when hit. Dismemberment and/or decapitation can be seen in fights. During fights, the ground is usually covered in blood and gore.

Language is mild. Use of "damn", "$h!t" and other mild language is heard.

Sexuality is very minor. While exploring, you can come across hot springs (highly recommended). You can see the character's buttocks as he enters.

Drugs or use of alcohol is present. A character talks about sake and getting drunk. Characters are seen drinking sake.

Great game
I think this game is definitely great for thirteen year olds and above. This game is a action adventure game and although it has some violence it is not all about killing. Jin ( the main protagonist ) often shows remorse for any acts of
violence he has committed which I believe to be a
great example of why the game should be rated T
for 13+ instead of M 17+

Brilliant open world Adventure!
Playing the game i got to see first hand how the Studio who made the game really pushed the limits of story telling in a game.
Ghost of Tsushima is an action based Role Playing Game in which you assume the role of a Crestfallen Samurai. Set during the Feudal era of ancient Japan during the Mongol's conquest of the island, the game is a realistic portrayal of being a defending samurai during that Period of history. This, with its benefits also comes wit some drawbacks, the game is quite violent with vivid imagery of blood' and on some occasions, shows a man's exposed arse. this drew ESRB to rate it M (17+) which bit believe is a bit over the top! Comparing it to "THE WITCHER 3 : WILD HUNT" Ghost of Tsushima is relatively tame in comparison which has led me to believe it is suitable for ages 15+.
