AMAZING
When we got our switch, we got this game and animal crossing new horizons. But this game is amazing anyone can play it but there is some violence but it’s barely even to be called violence because it’s not violent but the games with violence are, battle tanks, team tanks, and shooting gallery. There is no love stuff. But if you all get the game I recommend to play this game in the game it’s called Mancala. That’s all I recommend the whole game.

Memories
Loved playing these back on the Sega Genesis and still love playing them now. The memories from these games are just great.

Completely unobjectionable
The only reason I put 5+ is because I'm not sure if anyone younger could get down the controls (or if I'd let them handle my Switch).

Instant hit
My 6 year old son who has a mischievous streak was able to live out his greatest fantasy of playing pranks on people albeit as a goose. He laughed so hard and got really involved trying to sneak things past the groundskeeper. Though the puzzles were a little bit beyond him and he did get a little frustrated with the controls. At one stage he felt sorry for the groundskeeper so be of mind the goose is an absolute pest to people so theres no positive messages here. But for pure unadulterated fun and mischief this game is spectacular in its delivery.

Good fun
Really clever puzzles that work well for all ages. Kids love being sneaky goose. The goose behavior is certainly "bad" but in a very playful pretend way. A huge hit in our home.

SO FUN!
its the best puzzle game ever no one talks in the game so no languge there is no sex or romance so cross that and no violence you cant interact or see other players ( I think) there is no consumerism (again I think) its not extactly easy to play the controls are hard to control the game is just about being a goose and cause a lot of trouble I recommend if your looking for a great puzzle game!

No violence stealth game!
Finally! A stealth game without any shooting or violence! Untitled Goose game may sound stupid but I think it's one of the best games to come out in 2019. This game hasn't got any role models or great message but it's a stealth puzzle game so it has got some educational value.

A Very Unique Hidden Gem of Third Party Producers
This is such a unique game on so many levels as no one has never made a game like this. As you are a goose who's a jerk to people, it's a really fun change of things in video games. My only problem would be that it's not as long as I had hoped, but that's okay because that should be expected from a smaller production company. I highly recommend especially if you're looking for something different and unique

Not good for kids
Whoever thinks this is good for kids needs their priorities set straight. Like all lego games the cartoonist and sometimes slapstick violence can be considered ok for kids but personally it is just teaching kids that violence is rewarded by coins dropped by destroyed objects and killing characters. There are several weapons that are also obviously made out of lego but in real life are genuine weapons but they seem to pass it off just because of the characters that are killed, are simply broken apart into separate pieces. There are also uses of special mystical powers. I would not let kids play this ever personally.

Ninja-Go!
The game is a lot better than the movie. The story was like the movie but kind of like the show. There are characters from the series and there are little dojos where you can fight the bosses from the series. Its a great game. If you like Ninjago, the movie or the show, your going to like this.

i'd highly recommend this videogame
this really brings out the film it was based on but it's not the best game ever because it's not that different from the film but it's still fun to play

Jump Back, Flip Back, Kick Around and Spin-ish
First of all, this game is by NO means bad in any possible way. It was a pleasant surprise for my brother to get with our Nintendo Switch for Christmas (I already saw that I would get LEGO Worlds and he would get Super Mario Odyssey on my dad's Amazon orders), and... we only had one Joy Con. Whoops. Well, he played the first few levels, but I was able to get through the last few. So NO, perhaps I have NOT played this game fully, but pretty much enough to get the gist; it is a really fun LEGO game, but the complexity? Not too much. It does have it's challenges here and there, but I would have beaten it in one afternoon if we weren't also playing Super Mario Odyssey and LEGO Worlds (both of which are better, but all of them are good nonetheless). Also, I find it rather impressive they included all of the physical Ninja-Go mini-figures in the game, however, there are ONLY characters from the sets, show, and movie; that is it. You can make your own eight characters (shirtless Robert Jacob for the win), but there is not much variety, really. But all the martial arts combos that would surely impress Kung Fu Panda and comedy sharper than a samurai sword (albeit the film was expectantly funnier), The LEGO Ninja-Go Movie makes for a ton of pleasure. Now, onto content!
Violence: All really cartoon. In this action adventure game, based on the LEGO Ninja-Go Movie, you assume the role of LEGO ninja as they traverse environments, solve puzzles, and fight hostile antagonists. You use broadswords, maces, and pikes to kill invaders in intense melee battle. Fighting is accompanied by collision sounds, pained yelps, and sizable detonations; characters burst into cartoon LEGO bricks when killed. In one sequence, you pilot either an aircraft, a huge bot, or both if you switch characters, and use a cross hair target to fire blaster and thunderbolt projectiles at titanic AIs and ground targets.
