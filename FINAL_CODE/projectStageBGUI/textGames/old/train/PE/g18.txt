I love the interceptors
If you think this is too violent for anyone you are wrong. The game says you shoot down civilian ship when in reality you are shooting down the rebels or the imperials.

Easy to learn, hard to master.
Amazing Star Wars flight sim for now and next gen consoles. There is really nothing alarming and the violence is child’s play compared to the movies. I bought it for offline progression with my flight stick and binaural headset, but it works perfectly on all control methods. Great but for the hardcore flight simmer as you’ll need patience and practice for this.

Star Wars Squadrons
So I don’t own this game, but I’ve seen gameplay on YouTube. I saw CSM do a ridiculous review and thought I could help concerned parents. So violence: 3/10 spaceship combat, lasers, stuff blows up, blah blah blah. Nothing else in the other category’s but I’m not sure where the word “bastard” is but ok. I heard way worse at 4 or 5. At the core it’s Star Wars, c’mon. This game looks pretty fun, but it just seems like another Star Wars game. So yes that’s all

age 11+ 
What I think about my child playing it
I think the game is basically just planes sure it says bastard in the dialogue but a 11 year old can handle that no sex scenes or references it's just a aeroplane shooting game with good graphics so that's what I say I think it's a great game

Really great game
It is a great game bases in the star wars universe. You play as a starfighter and you are given multiple objectives to take out. The only violence is an explosion as you destroy an enemy target or starfighter. There is no swearing at all. The controls are hard to grasp at first but the more you play the game the easier the controls become. Because it is an online game there is voice chat so you can talk to other players and they might swear. Dont worry though as there is an option to disable voice chat so if you dont want your child to talk and listen to other players then just disable that option. Overall,this game is fine for anyone over the age of 10.
an amazing game
it is pretty good. the combos feel satisfying to pull off it finally runs at 60 frames per second, the battle mode is really fun. my big problem with this game tho is the single-handed mode. I don't know why but the mode feels very unbalanced but the game? pretty good.

is this like super smash bro's???

Best game but rushed
Great game, but DreamWorks, OG, and even its developer wayforward were in a hurry to make it, and they didn't work much. If more work had been done, they could have made the game better.

Good
It is a great game for a little more mature 11 year olds

Not bad
As usual common sense over exaggerated. The Game is amazing btw. But the sexual content is little to none there is one scene where you go the brothel but nothing is shown the women do say some suggestive stuff but nothing they haven’t heard before. Violence is bad but the same as call of duty.
Commonsense-media over exaggerates everything.
I’ll give you a quick synopsis of all parental categories and then a quick summary.

Violence : No gore, there’s some melee violence, and a very little amount of blood spill and blood spread. (3/10)

Language : There is not much language, honestly pretty minimal, due to the don not liki ... continue reading

Great game for preteens and teens
The game is an excellent remake of the original, with a bit of swearing, a some violence, minimal nudity/sex, and it's not too bad with drugs.
Really, REALLY bad
Based on my first hour of gameplay I say this

It has absolutely horrendous models, voice acting, animations, combat the list goes on and ON

The enemies have a hivemind mindset meaning that if one of them spots you , the entire village piled with enemies magically does too, resulting in broken stealth mechanics and unfair gameplay

The voice acting quality and the game models are terrible, and note that the game models are still absolute garbage on the highest graphic settings

The animation and the facial features are, well, a dumpster fire

The story doesnt seem at all interesting

Overall the game is just bad, right now im just really hoping it will get better from here because Im still only at the beginning of the game.

The little port that could.
Not too graphic. Blood is turned off by default for some reason. When you turn it on there's a fair bit, but not over the top; and there is no gore whatsoever. You'll occasionally come across bloodier scenes of past conflict, but still no gore. Average amount of profanity.
Open world games and shooters have evolved over the years and Crysis is relatively simple. But there is still fun to be had with the sandbox, the AI, and the strategies you can take. No much enemy or objective variety but good amount of freedom (at least in ch 1-6/10). Now on the go. Still far below the PC version, its still a vast improvement over the previous console ports. Sporting a mostly consistent 30 fps (chapter 9 is a complete travesty though) , and visuals that are quite lovely coming from a humble Nintendo tablet; especially given the huge levels with no loading screens.

Absolutely incredible collection of beloved mario games
This collection contains Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Mario Galaxy. These games are hours of fun and every stage has some new goal or item to collect. Everything is cartoony. No violence, no blood, just cute action. Mario is a character that has been around for 35 years now, and he has always gone into his adventures with a smile. Every time, he’s trying to defeat bowser or some other evil. Sometimes the controls can get weird in Galaxy because of the gravity of the planets, but other than that these games are simple and pulled off incredibly.

Love the collection
Three classic Mario games packed into one limited stock game. Mario 64 has so many great moments, the classic levels, the great soundtrack and is all right enjoyable, the only flaw is that stupid stupid camera, that's what will kill you the most. Super Mario Sunshine, my favorite out of all three and one of the best, and most underated Mario games ever, F.L.U.U.D makes the game even better, some of the best music in the series. Super Mario Galaxy, my least favorite in the collection but still is great the graphics and soundtrack are amazing, the largest flaw is the fact that you kind off have to use detached joy cons to play, and that they didn't include Super Mario Galaxy 2! The collection of music is amazing, and has some of the best music in the series!

Pretty Good!
A great game, but for a collection I would be expecting a bit more, for
Example getting Super Mario 64 into widescreen. Still worth its pricetag though. Really Love playing the game and listening to the games soundtracks. Apart from my small nitpicks, this game is practically perfect.

Cash Grab
This game is an overpriced cash grab. For alternatives, I would dump the GameCube and Wii ISO files yourself and play them in Dolphin emulator and configure the settings to match what you want, for Super Mario 64, you can play the new PC port, which allows mods that make the game look like it's original promo artwork.

Three masterpieces ported onto the Switch.
All three of these games are amazing. Mario 64 is the game that revolutionized 3D games, Sunshine is a classic that introduced many new moves and mechanics, and Galaxy is the gem that uses the abilities of joy-cons/pro controller to it’s advantage. When I first got the game, I thought Galaxy’s controls would be bad (I play on the pro controller), but it was really easy to get used to. I’d say that I actually like it better than the Wii motion controls. However, there are some segments that can get frustrating at times (for example, the pinball/pachinko level in Sunshine and Sling Pod Galaxy in Mario Galaxy). I think that kids would have to be around nine to fully enjoy the experience of this bundle.

3 Great Mario Titles, if not a bit overpriced
I love these 3 games to death, and when it was announced that these games would be making their way to the Switch, I was excited. Every game was in widescreen, except Mario 64. So I figured I should get the bad stuff out of the way so I can talk about the good stuff. Mario 64 has almost no changes outside of some updated textures, GUI, and the removal of the Backwards-Long Jump. Sunshine now plays in widescreen, but the framerate is all over the place and some things weren't optimized correctly. Galaxy's still perfect. Galaxy 2 is not included. Now that I'm done with the bad, let's move on to the good. Mario 64 has updated textures, GUI, and big fixes. Sunshine plays in widescreen and has some updated textures. Galaxy now lets you use Y to spin instead of shaking the Joy Cons and looks great on Switch. The soundtracks for all 3 games are included in this collection. Now, is it worth the money? Eh, I guess if you wanna play these games on the Switch or if your PC and/or phone isn't power for emulation, go ahead, but if you can emulate these or already own these games, I wouldn't bother buying it. Also, the limited release thing is kind of a scummy move from Nintendo, so you should really get this before March of next year if you want it.

it’s cool though But Get it now OR ELSE .
It’s awesome that Nintendo gave us ports of the best 3D Mario games,I mean sure it’s just a Bunch of ports but I guarantee that it is worth 60$ and I am not a Nintendo fanboy I am more of a sega guy
And that says a lot
P.S if you are having a hard time with a level then just keep trying you’ll get there.

MUST BUY(but be careful)
MARIO 3D-ALLSTARS
we have mario 64, mario sunshine(my favorite of the three), and we have mario galaxy. these are 3 of the BEST and HIGHEST rated games and it is a great way to experience these classics. some levels may be frustrating like in mario 64 the camera is annoying but you will get used to it, and with sunshine their are these levels where they take away your F.L.U.D.D and it can be frustrating. With galaxy's case it can be frustrating when you do the prankster comets which could upset some younger kids. but honestly its worth it. also realy important if you want to give this to your child beware... ebay is a bad place scalpers will rip you off and, another important thing is if you get this game from what we know today, the game is in HUGE DEMAND and getting a physical copy is difficult because of the demand, also the game will COMPLEATLY go away FOREVER next year on march 31.

It’s Limited Supply
Great games but there is limited supply of the physical copies and the digital version and physical are only going to be available until March 31 2021. Because of this I have to takes away a “star” because it’s “anti-consumer” and forces people to purchase it or miss out. It’s good but it pressures people to buy it. Especially physical. Do NOT buy from scalpers unless it’s already been removed from the eshop. Then do what you want.

Bringing retro games to this generation
It’s just a good pack of games a lot of us played as kids ,they also removed a voice clip in Super Mario 64 “so long king bowser!”That sounds like
“So long gay bowser!” other than that Super Mario sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy are safe and fun games
