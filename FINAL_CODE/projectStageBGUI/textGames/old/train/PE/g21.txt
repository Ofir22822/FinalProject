Great for your kids!
This game is a really good game for kids! The game is a competition where you race a play ton of fun game modes including soccer, an American Ninja Warrior like obstacle course, and many more! The review says that it has some violence in the game, but it is referring to a few cartoon characters falling down in a funny way like a looney toons character. The game may be online that worries some parents, but you are just paying against them, you cannot talk to the other players. You can play with your friends in this game, but to friend them you have to but their exact gamer tag in to friend them and they have to accept your friend request. It does have a currency in the game, but if it does anything it teaches kids how to use money well. The game is 20 dollars, but any penny is worth it!

I think it is super super safe.
I am 12. I play it, and I have a ton of fun. I think that if your kid isn't too young to hold a controller and doesn't get mad super super easily, this is the game for them. It is super easy to play and really fun for all ages. Let your kid play this. The only thing I would say is that you can buy things with real money, so you have to watch out for that.

Family friendly game that can be frustrating
This simple, amazing and slightly frustrating game is a must play. Whether you are young and interested in this colourful mess of fun or if you’ve seen the thousands of YouTube videos. It’s very fun but it can get so frustrating you might hate it and all of it’s mini games. Besides that I still recommend it.

The Game Thats Taking The World By Storm
This game has taken the world by storm quicker than almost any other third-party indie game. It's now one of the most popular games on Twitch and tons of known faces are playing this game. Really, a kindergartner can play this game. This game is all about a series of mini-games , where players can get eliminated. If they are not eliminated, they go on to the next round. The cycle repeats until there is one "fall guy" left. There is no violence at all, the only thing that happens is your "fall guy" falling down off the map. This is an online game but there is no communication with people you don't know. There are some in-game purchases, but they are no necessary at all.Its just for outfits, patterns and emotes for you character. Really, Fall Guys is a great game, and anyone can play it.

One of the best games of 2020!
This is an amazing game! It is a lot of fun and is easy to pick up and play. There is a bit of a learning curve, so it will take you a little while to qualify for the next round. There is no violence or language. It may be frustrating for younger players because it might take a bit of time to learn how to play. Over all this is an amazing game!

Packed with fun and rage at the same time
Fall Guys is a Battle Royale like no other, in the style of TV shows like Tekashi's Castle or WIPEOUT. Filled with fun modes and rage inducing team modes, be the last bean (or Fall Guy) standing.

Violence is very mild, hardly worth mentioning. Characters do stumble, tumble, roll and fall over

so much fun
This game is fast paced and upbeat. I think anyone old enough to play videogames would enjoy this. A lot of multiplayer "kiddie" games like Slither.io for example have super edgy user names, but this one doesn't even let you name yourself which I think makes the game a whole lot more kid friendly. Great game.

Very fun and chaotic online platformer game that is slightly lacking in content as of release
Fall Guys is a ton of fun, but I suggest waiting for a while before buying it, because the team plan to add more to the game as they go along.

Very worth buying though if you want it now.
GREAT game 1/10 scariness so any age really
Any age can play this! It’s really fun and colorful and it’s really happy and positive and fun for all ages. The only scariness is falling into the abyss off the map if someone throws you but that’s all!

Super Fun! Kind be frustrating at times...
Fall Guys is really fun. It got popular really fast, and it makes sense why. The player must complete obstacle courses, survival games, and team games as jelly beans in costumes. It's hilarious.

Cons:

Frustrating. Some maps are unfair and the gameplay is still a little buggy.

of course, like any other 2015-2020ish game, it has a Battle Pass.

Silly, multiplayer madness.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of my favourite multiplayer games. Each of it's mini-games are unique, fun, and utterly hilarious. Even after playing many, many rounds it's still fresh and exciting. In addition, Fall Guys' in-game currencies can be earned easily from playing, rather than paying. You can buy Kudos (the in-game currency) if you want to, but it is very, very easy to earn just by performing well. Fall Guys is fun on it's own, but playing with friends is an absolute blast. So is it worth the £15 price tag? Definitely. 8/10.

Fast-paced, adorable action for kids!
Fall Guys is a game that seeks to imitate reality shows like Wipeout, wherein groups of 60 players compete to pass rounds of minigames to try to be the one winner.

The game has a colorful neon aesthetic, which naturally draws the attention of kids. The games are all very engaging and reminiscent of basic childhood games like Rob the Nest (Egg Scramble), Virus Tag (Jinxed), and Tail Tag. Some are simple "race to the end"-type games, and others are team-based. Winning a whole game is quite difficult, and provides a sense of repeated challenge that some children may enjoy, but that others may find frustrating.

The game controls are simplistic and accessible: you can move around, jump, dive, and grab. That last mechanic allows players to grab onto ledges and even other players, which (when done with the intent of making them lose) is called griefing. Although being griefed is somewhat uncommon, it can cause your child to lose unjustly when it does happen. Talk with your child about dealing with griefers online!

Overall, this is a perfect introduction into online video games for a child, and a blast to play for all ages.

Fun for all ages!
Great game for kids and adults alike!

Me and my son have been playing for a week now and have really been really enjoying the game! The game is great for anyone which wants a laugh and relax after a stressful day. I really recommend it whether you're a child or an adult!

Haven't found any bad words other than 'Hell' or 'Damn' and no sexual content. No blood or gore but a bit of cartoon-like violence.

Awesome alien game not for younger audiences
I've noticed other reviews are saying that this game is terrible and not to play. I beg to differ, yes it does have quite a bit of crude content and isn't suitable for younger audiences but its really no comparison to Mortal Kombat 11 or Skyrim. The only gore it has is cartoony and it doesn't even look like gore, more like yellow slime. It doesn't even show sex, makes references but doesn't actually show it. Might be suitable with some parental guidance but its really not as bad as other hot titles.

Fun alien invasion game got released at the perfect time
Destroy All Humans! is an alien invasion game where you can use sci-fi weapons and tools to annihilate the human race. While it may look like a game for 8 year olds, it contains some swearing and dark humor. It also contains a large variety of weapons like, plasma blasters, chain lightning guns, telekinesis, anal probes, and flying saucers that shoots lasers and colorful bombs. If you like movies like Mars Attacks, or Killer Klowns from Outer-Space, then I highly reccomend this game.
