Amazing!
I played the original 7 years ago and this one does what made the first one so enriching and doubles it!
Yes - The game is hard and that may turn off most players but if you stick with it you won't regret it.
This game doesn't have any sexual themes and Mario levels of violence (Almost no blood and NO gore at all).

Good Start to a first Marvels Game!
This game is really fun! but do not expect MINECRAFT children to start playing it, Violence wise its what you'd expect from an Anvengers game its got quite a bit of violence but ok for 10+ children if you're watching them and seeing the scenes with them then 8+ should be able to play it but thats like on the cutting edge.

Complex story
This game has a complex story other than just saving the day. They basically stop the media from being fake.

Had high expectations, what a shame.
I remember being so hyped for this game, yet playing it and wishing I didn’t buy it. I know nobody wants to read a paragraph so I’ll give you some pointers:

- Graphics are ok for this games budget, but disappointing.
- Controls are very wonky, and sometimes you find yourself spamming instead of memorizing combos because you’re sick of dying.
- Violence is not realistic at all, and is comparable to Minecraft.
- Combat is fun, and similar to Marvel’s Spider-Man which consists of a fast mix of dodging, countering, and attacking.

To sum it up, if you want a good superhero game, buy Marvel’s Spider-Man.

Good game held back by glitches
It's a Mavel game, I played it and it should be appropriate.

As for the game's quality well, there's some bugs and glitches, but they'll get fixed.

Overall, decent campaign, ok online stuff, worth your time, but not $60 USD

Great Game That's Underated
This is great game that is getting way too many bad reviews. The gameplay is incredibly fun, although a bit grindy in the multiplayer missions. The story is great although I would've liked for Thor to be in it a bit more. For most of the game you fight robots and a few human troopers. There is no blood, gore or sexual content. The gear and level system could be a bit confusing for younger gamers. 11 or 12 years old should be good.

Not that bad
It’s really not as bad as some people are saying but I’m not sure yet I just started playing a couple hours ago, so I’m not fully sure about this game just yet but so far so good.

Fun campaign undermined by glitches and a mediocre online counterpart.
Marvel's Avengers doesn't really do anything that a video game hasn't done before, but it's still good fun. The campaign is great, with a good story and lots of memorable moments. However, the online counterpart isn't as fun. The levels feel recycled and the boss battles don't require any skill, just mindless button bashing. And in both modes, there are many glitches that ruin the immersion completely. Don't get me wrong, it isn't awful - but it isn't great either. So is Marvel's Avengers worth playing? Yes. But is it worth playing right now? No. Wait a year or so, then jump in. Hopefully by then, the issues will have been fixed and the online will be more fun. 6.5/10.

The Below-Averagers
Repetitive missions, no enemy variety, every character almost feels the same, every enemy needlessly tanky so you can buy more loot to make them killable, the story is lackluster; with no memorable villians, scummy monetization. Framerate is pitiful. Graphics are okay I guess.

I really loved this game
This game is amazing. I picked up a controller did the tutorial and then tried the first level and felt I knew what to do. This game despite your character having probably broken many bones always has your character keep going and trying knew things. Their are some lyrics, messages (When you are playing on one of the levels with cars), and loading screens that cuss have some songs curse (but you can turn the songs off on the playlist) and there are some weird loading screens, but overall this game was great and I would highly recommend getting it.

Why is this a teen rated game?!?!
This game is absolutely awesome. I totally understand the concern about some of the language and references in some of the song lyrics but you CAN turn the music off Although that does ruin the vibe a bit. But if you do really want the music there is a way to deselect a single song in the playlist. Going aside from the lyrics for a second there ARE some nasty slams but it never gets into anything like blood. Altogether it think that this is a really solid game and I think anyone 10 and up can play it.

Tony Hawk strikes back big time!!
This game is great. Content from 2 games and more all remastered in one collection.

Of course some of the lyrics in the songs may be inappropriate, so be careful about that.

Overall, great game.

Can be fun if you Practice
I have been playing these types of games for years and they are really fun. But, just be aware that the game is hard to learn at first. And, if you play online, you might hear a bit of swearing.

Wondering if NBA 2K21 is OK for your kids?

NBA 2K21 is the best game
What is the most popular game in 2020? Without a doubt, it must be Minecraft, but actually, it is NBA 2K21! To just spend just a few minutes playing it is well worth your money and time for its great control over players, speedy updates, vivid animations, and jaw dropping high definitions
The controlling is precise so it makes the controlling very complex and hard. Some games are only in HD quality, but in Nba 2k21, you can play it in 4K, Even though games like Minecraft and Roblox are famous, I would strongly disagree because it is definitely not as good as NBA 2k21.

It's a really fun basketball game.
My little timmy was shooting people in a hood
This game lets you do more than the last game it lets you swear shoot people and play basketball.
