 
Commonsense is too sensitive
Commonsense's rating for this game is WAYYY to high. There is a lot of crashing (basically its is the whole point of the game) but there are no people in the cars, blood, guts, guns or any other kind of violence. it is in my opinion, one of the best driving games

This Game Rocks!!!
I love this game!!! There are a few pauses. In online mode the players can say WHATEVER they want so that is an issue. Also "Girlfriend" by Avril Lavigne is included with the game. Overall it is a great game. The graphice are INSANE. I thinkit is fine for kids 11 and up

Remastered fun for HD crashes
Burnout Paradise is a fun crashing based racer. Fast paced racing, adrenaline chase thrills, and the main objective of the game: "Crash other vehicles". Vehicular violence is the main factor. The main goal is to takedown other racers or other civilians vehicles. Some lyrics from songs are crude, and a bit sketchy.

Good game, but has alot of destruction.
Okay, so as you'd expect from the way it looks it is a racing game, with an awesome twist!

In a certain mode In this game you can blow the heck out of any vehicle that gets in your way, everything goes FLYING (literally) There are no bodies in the vehicles, Which takes the graphic content levels way down.

However, The crashes and damage look quite detailed and realistic, due to it's remaster mainly, But it even looked detailed back then, This game has great graphics remastered or not, so do expect it to be a rather intense experience, but kids aged at least 8 and over will like this game alot (if they like Destruction Derby type of things)

Bad language is not a concern, nor is sex or substances,

But frightening scenes may include the crashes, they can get quite major, But if your kid knows it's not real, then hopefully they should be alright.

Recommended for 8+ by me for moderate vehicle action violence, but no injury detail at all.

A Perfect game for a child who wants to play Old School Last Gen Games
The gameplay in this game has kept it's New-like age for 7/8 YEARS(thats how old this game is :D) i remember playing the PS3 Version and instantly LOVED the game, i remember when i got my BSI(Big Surf Island) Licence in 2009. but im going off topic there. So that is why i rate this game 5 Stars.
Remember to try the online function :D And Have Fun!

8&up shoudl be fine...
This game is not bad at all. If your child understands that crashes and flying off mountains and wrecking cars are only done in video games then they will be fine. Before buying this game talk to them about what they do in the video game shouldn't be done in real life. I would have put this as 6 and up except that most 6-7 year olds won't understand some things. Mild "violence" is only crashing, but if you very worried about that, just make sure your child doesn't jump off mountains, crash, drive very, very slowly, and stop on red lights, but that makes the game totally pointless. There is an online mode where people are free to say anything they want in their mic. and everyone playing on that server will hear. A simple solution to that is to turn off the volume. If online still bothers you, just disconnect your ethernet cable or disconnect wireless connection.

Home sweet paradise!
Paradise city is a great game. I got when I was like, 8 so I know what's in the game that is inappropriate for kids 9 and up. I also know where everything is too. There is no cussing at all! Let's just call it the best game ever.

If your kid(s) is under 7, worry about the Consumerism and Safety.
Okay, the sex is only 5%. It's a bikini lady as a decoration for it. Some features in it require to give cash.

Great racer, violent crashes, 12+
This game is great. The graphics are brilliant and the racing is realistic. You use boost to speed up cars and their are several different race types including one where the objective is to smash oher people's cars. I think people who are 12 years old and over. PARENT WARNING: The crashes are realistic, detailed and are replayed in slow-motion.

Nothing inappropriate execpt for the ocasianly strong lyrics.
This is a fun racing game, but have severel crash scenes that are incouraged, and inappropriate lyrics. There is one song that has the f word in it, but is barely notible if driving in 3rd person perspective.

Burnout Revew
I Beleave That Burnout Paradise is an Fun, Addicting game for Teens-Adults,
Online can be a bit harsh due to adults cussing each other out, its quite funny sometimes,But sometimes People talk about Important Things,
Anyway, I have Made a Mental Map (I know i play a lot) Of where everything is, So it will help with memory
Sure the Wrecks should kill you, Luckily there is no actual humans walking or driving

Ok for older kids
A fairly mild racer. Cars explode, you get points for destroying other cars. No drivers in the cars and the bike drivers dissapear before the crash. Ads for real life countries and a "skate 2" billboard tie in.

greatest racing game ever
The best racing game ever!Killer graphics,cool cars, it's awesome!

Exciting fun
Aside from the driving at the speed of sound(which your kids should already know is dangerous),i think its just an awesome and exciting racing game.It also has no swearing,drugs/alcohol and sex.Although it is kind of violent because you can smash other cars into oblivion.

Entertaining "drive almost anywhere" race and "smash'em up" game
Probably the best "open world" racing game. Very smooth graphics on PS3. While some people may complain about billboard advertizements in the game, I feel this is an acceptable way for publishers to generate revenue and helps keep the price of games down. It's done in most movies now as well. In the real world, we don't put blindfolds on kids every time we take them for a drive so that they won't see billboards.

A good game for kids
I feel that this game is great for kids over 11 years old. The only things to worry about Burnout: Paradise are that there is a lot of violence and there are billboards with commercials including Gillette and diesel signs. This game is great unless you have a who you wouldn't trust to tell the difference between the game and real life. The only major problem in this game is cars crashing and slamming into one another

It's like perfection: you get to race, blow stuff up, and look at awesome cars you will never own. This game rocks!
Well, I have not actually played THIS game, but I have played lots of other Burnout titles. I must say that the Burnout games are fine for older tweens that understand this is how you are NOT supposed to drive, there are no humans in any of the cars, and if you do drive like this in the real world, your car will crash like it does on the game and you will die. (LOL)


But seriously, the Burnout series in general rocks. I watched trailers and in game videos and this game looks AWESOME. I also recommend Burnout Revenge, which is for the PS2 and 360. Just make sure your kids can tell the difference between real and fake. Some of the songs are edgy and stuff, so make sure you disable the ones you don't want your kids listening to.


But yeah. totally awesome. Great mindless game for tweens and teenagers looking for an explosive boredom buster.

Fun and entertains younger ones.
This is a great fantasy racing game with a few bad messages. This is very child friendly. It shows you how not to drive! Burnout has always been cool and fun but this is the best for kids, Not hard. You can either compete in races or drive round at 200mph. The best way to see Paradise city is at 250mph. Its got bad messages because of you drive horribly. Trying to blow yourself up. Well I do and everyone else. Its very kid friendly overall. Its fun!

Good for teens and tweens as well.
This game is great, plain and simple. No language, no alcohol or drugs and nothing big to worry about. Although, parents should let their kids know that this is not the way to drive. Even though some of the driving action in the can be imitated, it's not really an issue. I would recommend this game for teen players.

Burnout returns again.
And it sure doesn't dissappoint. More vehicle crashing mahem, more racing, and more DESTRUCTION. Appropriate for all ages, but especially anyone 10 or over. VERY FUN!!!
