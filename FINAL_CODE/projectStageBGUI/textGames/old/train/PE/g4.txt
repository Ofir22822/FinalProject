No more respect
Spoiled spoiled spoiled.
I use to put up with letting my son watch Ruans toy review until I went into Walmart a couple days ago and they were selling a Ryan's toy egg for $40.00!! Inside the egg include Putty, a sticker, a tattoo and a small action figure! Things you can get put of the quarter machine I was infuriated by this. The kid already makes millions off of YouTube now his parents are getting GREEDY. Sick.

Love Ryan, not his toys.
We really love Ryan and his whole family. They are sweet and generous and deserve their good fortune. However, the toys are junk. We have been collecting the figures. Two have broken only one day after buying them. We don't purchase slime or putty in this house. It's hard to tell my son that I won't be spending any more money on something he loves so much, but it's literally going almost directly to a landfill. I know all the plastic is, but thought if he could get some joy from them for a while....oh well. We play the game Tag with Ryan about 20 minutes a day. We take turns and we laugh a lot. I took pictures of the broken toys, but I don't see a place to download them.

I am a struggling single patent. The ONLY time my 5 yr old daughter can watch Ryan is when we visit my mother. I have saved and saved to be able to buy her "this AMAZING MYSTERY EGG" AT a whopping 40$!! !!!! 40$! ! It was a joke. And I mean a blatant lack of toys, anything educational. And I'm just blown away. I could have taken her for a happy meal and received better, more entertaining toys. You as parents are capitalizing on your child's accidental fame! You may have 40$ ,.. Or 70$ for that matter to spend on your child for a bunch of junk. But I do not. And I'm sure I'm not the only parent out here with the same issues. I'd be ashamed. And she's no longer allowed to even watch the show. We are very disappointed. I'd like my 40$ back. I get 200$ a month child support. And am disabled. We no longer support your show OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR CHILD. ENJOY THE WEALTH HE HAS GIFTED YOU! GOD BLESS!
And I totally agree about the mother's voice!! !! Hate to be ugly. But 40$ and add the voice in... I'm DONE. So is my child. I'd literally die before I let her become so consumed with material objects. So, when I decided to bend and get her the egg.... Like I said! What a joke and what JUNK!

Horrible exploitation by his parents
I can’t even begin to describe how awful his parents are. I don’t let my son watch Ryan’s Toy Reviews because it turns him into a whiney spoiled brat, who just asks for toys all day long. Ryan is going to grow up to be a horrible human being with parents like that. His mom and dad treat their children like money making assets. Their kids don’t have a normal child hood, and have spent most of their young lives putting on emotions and dramas for other people’s entertainment. Do their kids even know what normal reactions and emotions are????.....I refuse to support their child exploitation. As for the toys, they are horribly overpriced, cheaply made, and again, they support child exploitation...when will CPS get involved??....hopefully before Ryan goes postal.

Complete and Utter Trash
While my 3 year old loves this channel, my husband and I can't stand it. There's really no purpose to it, and the mother's voice is so extremely loud and obnoxious even when we have it set to the lowest volume on his tablet it is still extremely loud. Its just a video to make lot of money with those kids by their parents. My kid is watching it non stop just to waste his time, knowledge and skill. I'm just finding out ways to block those videos. ill be helpful if someone can suggest the way to block those completely from my gadgets. The mother's voice is very annoying, they have so many channels on youtube, and now ryans toys review, ryans family review, the auntie have a toy, a channel where ryan and his father play roblox ( roblox is full of paedos) I wonder if they really think we are fools to think that child isn't being exploited! not to mention that the parents always happy playing with the child make other parents look miserable. it is about time they close that channel enjoy their life and get out of my telly! I don't what's up with this channel but my kids always want to watch it. It has no educational value. The family behind this channel shares with you every trip, holiday, birthday, etc - with their 2 kids now (Ryan an his baby sister) opening presents. If you Google Ryan's Toys Reviews you'll see that it is a very profitable channel. Commercialism pure and simple. Don't partake. Nothing more than a tool for marketing to very young children. Zero value to kids. Everything about it. Ok, no, mostly the mom. Seriously awful. Its a giant commercial (which they don't hide) and are ALWAYS talking about freakin McDonalds. It is all so iritating. 1000’s worth of new toys every week, parents who play with them 24/7, hours at arcades, Disney, etc. This family is manipulating a very cute, smart kid for financial gain. The mother’s voice is probably the most annoying sound I’ve heard come out of an iPad. She dominates every video and screams and giggles a shrill sound nonstop. Torture. The dad is tolerable. This channel is not only non educational, and inappropriate for its target audience it’s strait up dangerous and should be blocked by most parents. Let me say , I used to really enjoy when this channel was new and they were a family having fun playing and reviewing common toys. Somewhere along the way the mother has let greed take control of her . As a father , I can tell you there is no way a 4-5 year old kid wants to push out a YouTube video every 4 hrs. Every 4 hours! These videos are keyworded and tagged creatively to specifically target your children and appear in the related searches of other videos they watch . They are literally TARGETING YOUR CHILDREN. ( Reminds me of old cigarette company tactics) Some of these videos are completely inappropriate. I found my son looking for household chemicals to mix because he saw it on Ryan’s Toy reviews and wanted to know what other things did when they mix. (His mom used to be a science teacher so she encourages toddlers to do experiments) Another is pitching “Cozmo” .... a $300 robot toy built for adults for in the office.... Or how about when they pretend it’s the first day of school and treat it like Bart Simpson and show kids how NOT to behave, the wrong way to act.... the whole show is misinforming kids. Young kids ... the ages that don’t know any better. They also coincidentally disable all comments on videos. They have now added a new channel called Ryan’s Family Reviews where they again use keywords and tags with related video feeds to target your children. This is why they have millions of views but not a lot of “likes”. They have also been accused of buying views and likes. They’re frauds and again they are targeting kids. They should be shut down imo, but there is no one to complain to. It’s a mess. while I let my daughter watch this when she was 2 and 3 I just cant let her watch it anymore. I understand that it is supposed to be toy reviews, and when it was that it was fine. but now he is hawking his own toy line at us and I wont give him more money. The parents are obnoxious and film everything, I never see him diciplined when he is acting bratty. I think it is one of the reasons my daughter thinks it's ok to whine. I stopped letting her watch this a week ago and the behavior is 100 percent better. I don't know what it is about this show but it just feels dirty. The fact that the parents quit their jobs and are living off of Ryan is disgusting. Worse yet more of the family members are going on his show. (Princess T is the mothers sister) The mother is annoying and the father can get nasty sometimes. I don't think Ryan has any real friends, They don't teach children anything, which is odd since the mother WAS a teacher. Its a waste of time. In one episode I watched this kid literally pull out A few hundred dollars of toys from this stupid superman egg!!! Are you kidding me? Not to mention so far I have counted this kid has AT LEAST 5 power wheel . Buying your kid(s) that many toys is outrageous! How do you ever come up with Christmas/birthday presents? When this kid gets hundreds of toys a week!!!???? There is nothing educational about these videos and I think it makes less fortunate families look bad cause it leaves kids wanting everything this Ryan kid has!!!!! My child won't be watching Ryan's videos that is for sure!!!! I cannot stand this show. There is absolutely no point to it and the mother’s voice is super annoying. I feel bad for Ryan that his family are using him to make some cash. My 3 yrs old loves watching his videos and I can’t stand it anymore. He throws tantrums when I won’t let him watch his videos. I wish YouTube have an option to block certain channels. It’s getting out of control. He’s just wasting his time with on this nonsense. He’s not learning anything good from this it’s just teaching kids to become more materialistic. My daughter loves watching Ryan's toy review, I myself cannot stand his channel. I do not like his parents voices and I think they are extremely greedy individuals .I cannot find where, or if even donates his toys to needy children. What kid needs that many toys and donations when they already met their expectations on becomming rich? There are many kids without, so why does this child need anything more, I am with success and am not a hater, but when I see people forking their money out to a boy who isn't struggling and has it all, doesn't make any sense to me. Children out there are starving and also would love to just own 1 toy. As parents we would do anything for our children,but asking for more money so your son can sit there and play with a 1000 toys... What kind of ppl are you? I don't care if the kids like his channel, I dont. Why do u think he has so many viewers? Because those kids don't have everything he does. Or they'd be playing with their own DAMN toys. The youtube channel Ryan's toy reviews does not offer any valuable information on any products they promote. Nor is there any constructive description about the toys they discard afterwards. Their channel is not only a waste of time for the viewer but encourages a child to disregard the value of a meaningful gift. when it comes to their games they let Ryan win without challenging him to follow rules or learn to loose. Every toy gets tossed aside and forgotten after a few seconds only to open another . The entire channel devotes all their time and efforts to flaunt Materialistic ideals. Anyone who truly appreciates what they have wouldn't expect a new toy to fill the void in their lives. The whole promotion of material wealth is sickening and teaches nothing more than Greed and Vanity" Therefore loosing any purpose to review weather or not the item actually lasts more than one second. Overall the construction of each Item is as unstable and cheaply made as the family's perspective on what is important. I wish it had never come up on auto play! It started with a good ol fashioned episode of paw patrol on YouTube. Apparently YouTube's algorithm lumps him in with legit cartoons. All it is, is a money grab for the obnoxious mother. She dumped all of her money into advertising and paying for paid time on YouTube then quit her job to receive free toys from companies that couldn't be bothered to donate to toys for tots much less donate to a charity. The poor boy seems on the verge of a meltdown when mommy won't buy toys ie: their paid trips to disneyland. (there's no need because SHE is sponsored from every toy company imaginable) Her husband seemed to genuinely enjoy it until she turned it into a greed fest. Now he just seems so forced. And tired, not physically but mentally beaten by her fake smile and negligence to her 2 daughters who didn't become important until she could sell them for views too. They went to Wal-Mart where they sell "Ryans" clothes and toys and they bought not 1 but 10 items. (Which means they get that money back to instead of taking any of the free products you KNOW they have. ) Odd that with ALLLLL the power wheels and money they have, she hasn't even given it a second thought to donate the toys he's out grown. Hoard, hoard, hoard. Or spent money on a gym membership or anything to care for herself better. It's been sad to see her inflate along with her money. I guess when you never want for basic things like food that's not something you worry about. I look forward to the day she can no longer cash in on her children and actually has to work again. It will be hilarious trying to explain "I quit my job to play with my sons toys for him because he want doing it right to get me enough views. " When youtube allows to block a channel from showing up on your feed (because right now it's like herpes, one time and its on there forever) it will be a glorious day.

Mixed feelings
Ok, in response to some of the other reviews... No, it's not educational, it's entertaining. Point blank. I don't think it's meant to be educational and that's ok, just watch it in moderation (tell me you never watch YouTube strictly for entertainment ). So his mom's voice is annoying, so what. Don't be rude. Now, as far as our experience with the show.. At first, my son was asking for a new toy every 5 seconds and I knew Ryan taught him that. I simply explained that we need to be thankful for what we have and that there's a lot of kids who don't have much and would love to have his toys. We have him donate his unused toys every few months or whatever and its actually something he looks forward to. Problem solved. Now he's like 'I still like Ryan but I don't know why he's so spoiled. " My point is, just stay on top if it, watch some episodes with your child and correct any undesirable behavior. Or just don't watch it, God knows we could all use a little less empty entertainment. Oh, and quit tripping about how his parents quitting their jobs to become YouTube stars.. Seriously? If you could get paid a ton of money just to play with toys all day with your kids, you wouldn't do it?

Waste of money
The toys should be sold at the dollar tree. I feel like Ryan’s Toys is taking advantage of his growing popularity to over charge for worthless crap that kids want because of his YouTube show. SO disappointing.

I approve
I think that if you teach your children not to want everything they see on TV that Ryan is great. My daughter's love the videos even though they know they can't have everything they see. Commercials are everywhere. Teach your kids about that kind of stuff and you have no problem. As for the mother's voice, someone might not like yours either and that's just rude. I don't care what you do when it comes down to it, my kids are allowed to be kids and watch Ryan. There are bad things to watch out for, but Ryan's toy review is not one of them

Kids love this show
My daughter loves this youtube channel and requests to watch it often. It has young children appropriate content, there is absolutely nothing innapropriate on here.

To all the reviews for this show that talk about how annoying his mom's voice is or that YOU hate it or that you're going to block it even though your kids love it, shame on you. It's not about what you like, it's about what your child likes. How happy they must be that you want to block a show they love because you don't like it. Let your kids do watch what they enjoy, especially when there is nothing innapropriate in this show.

In fact I believe his parents are good role models, they clearly love their children and spent a lot of time setting things up to make sure they are happy and have a lot of fun.

A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G
This family is annoying period. The child seems like a spoiled brat. Behaves Ike one too. He is used to getting everything his way an it shows when they are playing or unboxing toys. The mom, don’t get me started on her! The comments on here describe her well and to a T.
The voice, the laugh are unbearable to listen to. I blocked all channels and will keep blocking because I know some of his videos will filter through. At first I let my son watch it, but now it’s all he wants to watch. I sat and watched through a couple of videos one day with my son, for one day and that was enough for me. I said no more. Every time I hear the welcome to Ryan’s toy review, my eyes just roll. Aside from all the consumerism this family seems to flaunt every single aspect/angle of their home. They have left no privacy to their lives or their child’s. It’s sad to be honest. They are in it for the money at this point. My child sees that as well. That this child is filled with toys, and he wants the same, it’s hard to explain to a 3 year old that you can only afford so much and will not fill his home with toys either. Let alone buy him new toys every week. I let my son watch blippi. He teaches the function of things. It is such an educational show. NO MORE RYAN! This show should be removed for the child’s sake. To protect him ultimately.

Super Annoying
Both of Ryan's parents come of as super annoying. I guess it's a good skit for little children. If you try to sit down with your child to watch them Ryan and family will annoy you to the point of you trying to pull your hair out. Good luck.

No educational value annoying moms voice!
This is so annoying my kids like it but it has no educational value and the kids mom has the most annoying fake voice imaginable and in every video she says “Ryan” 100 x I used to like the name Ryan. Now it makes me cringe to hear “okay Ryan, come here Ryan, how do you like that Ryan, do you need to go to the bathroom Ryan?, okay let’s try this Ryan. She uses Ryan in Every sentence! I bought my kids headphones because they insist on watching the videos with the volume turned way up. Lady please tone it down and I forget what is his name?!?

Don't let your kids watch him.
He's a spoiled bratt, I've heard him when my kids watch the videos on YouTube kids and I don't like the way he acts. I've blocked his videos from my kids tablets. If he continues to show up on the YouTube kids app I will remove the app.

TEMPTATION AND ADDICTIVE
My son loves Ryan, cannot get enough of him so much that he keeps asking me to try and sort out a play date with him including flights to America ahhhhhhhhhhhh. The toys are marketed primarily for the American market and trying to buy them from the UK often means you pay over inflated ebay prices. A medium plush cost me over £25 and it is NOT medium. I was heart broken but my son loved it. We now have the option of getting some Ryan's toys at Smyth's toys but only limited to the yellow giant egg which cost over £50 at Christmas. my son wants the blue red and gold eggs for his birthday and I have no way of competing with his expectations. I fibbed and said that I went to America especially for the egg and it;s now back fired as he thinks I can just hop a plane and get them. Very hard situation for parents on a budget and you do feel like you're being exploited financially.

Greedy exploitative capitalistic garbage
I'm saddened my kids watch this.. Im sad for Ryan as the kid will have no privacy for the rest of his life because of his parents greedy decision to put his face on endless plastic garbage.
I'm also saddened that my kids listen to ryan's mum melt the TV speakers

When Ryan turns 18 I'm sure he's going to like these pyjama sets? Ryan's sister sadly will be used as a commodity to push more garbage products
I aim to block this channel from all devices in the household.

Who wants to see a grown man and woman play with slime? Someone please ban the parents from ever going on camera ever again,
The FBI should grant Ryan Anonymity and give him a new identity so he can walk away from this bizzare world he's been forced into, and for those of you that feel he can give consent a 3/4 Yr old has zero idea about the ramifications this could have on his future life

Have just seen her encouraging Ryan to smash toys up with an inflatable baseball bat. Enough is enough!!!!!!!! !

Worst show ever
Why is this family on YouTube????? There is absolutely no educational substance to it. The mother's voice is so loud and annoying. My son is so addicted to it I have no idea how I can block it on YouTube and even if I do they have other streams going. What the hell is wrong with this family????? All they do is play with toys that sponsors gave them. The huge house is paid for by YouTube. The parents came up with an idea to exploite their kids and make money and not get real jobs. Brilliant!!! Meanwhile other parents feel like taking a weedwacker to their faces

Ryan’s toy review channel
I’m not a fan at all, neither is my husband and my older two children. Our 4 year old loves the snow , I see no point and yes the mother’s voice is super annoying and there looks like there’s something wrong with the dad lol . My son asked me today why Ryan can have so many toys and he can’t? Broke my heart honestly cause he doesn’t understand, it also drives me crazy that no matter what game they play his mom always says he wins lol so my son sees that! I feel this channel is a very bad influence on my son and I wish he wouldn’t or could t be able to watch it

Materialistic Crap
This channel is absolutely awful. When we first saw it, Ryan was reviewing normal toys that you would see at Wal-Mart or Toys R Us. It was actually helpful to me as a parent and my son because he could see some toys weren't really fun to play with. But then the videos just got crazy. Ryan gets thousands of dollars of toys for no reason and his parents just go bonkers trying to come up with new "more fun" content. Spoiler alert: the new content isn't fun so much as inappropriate. There are even videos that just follow his parents around and Ryan isn't even in them. The whole channel is a marketing scheme to get kids to buy their crap. While watching Ryan open a ridiculous amount of toys, my son kept asking where his toys were and why we didn't give him toys all the time like Ryan got. He became whiny and upset when we told him no and that we couldn't afford all those toys. We finally took YouTube away from him entirely because it's not ok and it's not healthy for kids to be targeted by a family like this. I honestly hope YouTube pulls them soon because this channel has crossed the line from family fun to entitled crap.
