Not educational
Although my kid is hooked to it but I just don’t think the show give him any opportunity to learn and being creative. He is basically getting the excitement from watching a reality tv show and it’s all there is. I would say that the show is full of showing off their lives and random toys which no family is able to afford buying all those . The more kids watch the show, I think it pushes kids to compare and will develop a habit of keep wanting more things that only have instant gratification.

Boycott Ryan’s World!!
The biggest offender of child exploitation in YouTube! These “parents” are using their child for personal gain. The kid is simply pushing terrible product onto your children. His “toys” are vending machine garbage. The parents are constantly in the background making sure you know where to buy it. They’ve also disabled all comments on their videos. They have a net worth of $100 million. They don’t need anymore. Boycott Ryan, mostly his awful mother.

The worst in sugary consumerism
Teaching kids that it's OK to endlessly consume absolute rubbish. Along with the sickening line of toys they now market they're brain washing kids into extravagant consumerism before they're even able to write. It's banned in our house.

Parent directed play
My Child wants me to CONSTANTLY play with her due to loving to watch Ryan. Ryan's parents control the entire show to the point the father constantly interrupts his son- teaching that is just fine to do. No it's not. This show teaches your child many bad behaviours. It's been blocked in this house

Ryan's mother has my toddler enjoying science and we as a family enjoy creating science projects together. She is a amazing mom and science teacher and that's my opinion.

Parents spoil it
My little boy likes Ryan, but the parents have taken over and the content is neither educational or useful.

The mother has clearly taken over and her annoying drawl is a turn off.

The father seems a bit clueless, and that's being kind

They feed Ryan junk food and the consumerism is getting ridiculous.

They need to stop this nonsense? They've made their money pimping out their kids, just stop embarrassing yourselves and putting out total crap.

Great show for kids
At first I didn't really like the show. I thought the mom's voice was annoying basically what all the other reviews say about the show I thought. But after watching it with my son. They do have some educational videos. Where Ryan does little experiments like you would do in science class. Ryan's mother explains it, after they're done with the science experiment.Yeah they would push McDonald's a lot in their older videos but I think they got better with that. I seen videos where they encourage eating healthy and having good
dental hygiene.

Not what it used to be
There are some older videos on the channel where Ryan does science experiments that teach about density, mixing 2 colors to get a new color, the weather, etc. and there is at least one video where they sing an alphabet song. Those videos are educational and cute because it’s Ryan teaching &amp; learning things. But now all the videos they push out have Ryan starring in it for about .2 seconds and then the entire video is just the Mom doing what Ryan should be doing. The mom is in almost every single video &amp; Ryan is barely doing anything before she takes over &amp; it becomes an “adventure” with just the mom doing it. It’s like she wants to be the star of the show. Very sickening. They also push their line of toys, clothing etc. in almost every video. It had the potential to be a cute educational channel but that ship has sadly sailed.

Ryan’s Speech Disorder Ruined my Brother
Ryan has an irksome speech disorder and he pronounces all “s” sounds as “sh.” My 5 year old brother used to pronounce all his “s” sounds perfectly, but now that he has watched a lot of Ryan’s videos, my brother says things like “crackersh”, “fruitsh” , “yeshterday” , “friesh” .... and man it’s really hard for me to correct his speech since he watches these videos everyday. Someone please help because it makes my brother sound like he has a speech disorder.

This isn’t my favorite
This show is one I can’t handle. His mother’s voice itself makes me cringe. His dad is just odd, and I don’t feel like Ryan sets a good example. He makes kids believe they should wake up every day to new toys. They even made episodes about building that new insane (in my opinion very ugly) house. Showing off their money does become tacky. Aside from that it’s just not my favorite channel. My now 6yr old liked it for a minute when he was 4 but that came and went very quickly. Just no thank you to this family

Awful
These toys are expensive and they are they cheapest toys in the world.They have the cheapies toys inside ex. a sticky hand that you buy from a .50cents machine , a little ball that bounces that is like a quarter size that was probably a quarter and the toys break fast too. You pay almost $20 something that cost about 3 bucks .I don’t recommend this kids toys to anyone .Also the videos are uneducational they show him eating so much candy and whatever he does the kids want to do and he lies on the shows .I would give it 0 stars but there is no option for that.

Debatable
My Grandson loves this stuff.
Personally I prefer the Australian/Asian boy's reviews
But since Ryan has become more prolific my grandson
Just wants it on.
I would agree to a point that it is shameless marketing
To kids.. however they do use a lot of imagination and fun when creating these videos.
I agree that it is good that they are promoting good family relationships and values.
I cant see why everyone is complaining about the moms voice...arnt all American voices annoying?

Block this channel if you can
If i could give this 0 stars, i would. These parents do nothing but spoil their child on camera and then my kid expects to get the same treatment. All they do is give Ryan and abundance of new toys everyday and take him on a gazillion vacations to theme parks and other countries. Also, the mom's voice and laugh make my ears bleed. This family should be ashamed of themselves.

Virtual narcotic for kids
My daughter started talking about this so as I sit here and watch this garbage I have to agree with the other reviews. It just targets kids and gets them begging their parents for everything the show features. Plus I just watched an episode where it was nothing but gorging on candy. The parents took turns changing in and out of costumes as Ryan trick or treated in the house. They gave him candy and actual toys not the rinky dink toys like spider rings. Thanks a lot Ryan’s toys for hooking our kids like a drug lord and making them beg and beg us for toys that people can’t afford. My daughter thinks toys grow on trees now and cries every night for the latest Ryan’s toy.

Such an annoying show.
I hate this show and have tried to figure out a way to block it. Its all about the parents and very annoying how they have tried to make money off of their kid for so long. The mom is too much. Her voice is terrible and the way that they act is terrible. You can tell that the kid doesnt want to even be doing it. I hope someone steps in to monitor how much time they are trying to make him work.

Bouncy ball
My 6 year old son got a bouncy ball with one of his suprise eggs.
Anyways cut along story short. There should be a warning about the bouncy balls as they're particularly hard.
My fiance knows this in particular as he revived the bouncy ball at full force to his male genitalia. Which has now left him with larger testicles than the suprise egg. Now as amusing as I found it. I'd hate for it to happen to a child as I truly believe that it'd be a hospital trip.

Spoiled kid not educational
For a mom being an ex-teacher you'd think she would include some educational stuff to the channel. Ryan is spoiled and the twins are ignored and watched by grandma. I just watched an episode and Cosmo panda or whatever his name is starts saying and this is not an exact quote " ugh my mom makes me so mad! She keeps getting in my business asking about my day and stuff! I can't wait to get away and be alone. What calms me down is watching ryan." What kind of negative crap is that?! This show is geared to toddlers. Yea BYE Ryan.

Day before Christmas
In a episode it's the day b4 Christmas. Tye father and Ryan pull tissue out of the box. I know you told Ryan only one at a time. But yall still allowed him to win even though he cheated. My son watches this a lot and often I see this boy cheat and the parents allow it to happen. This show dose not teach anything but shows a spoiled child get what ever they want. In this Christmas episode the boy has a bunch bed and the little girls beds are on the floor, that was sad to see

So awful
Parents are pimping out their kid to make money. While the show used to be unboxing and Ryan playing with toys, it has not transitioned into pushing his own toys and merchandise that have now infiltrated stores.
Each episode is basically one long annoying sales pitch to kids to buy their merchandise. I would rather gouge my eyes out with spoons than listen to their money grubbing mom screech "RYAN!!!!" 9,999.99 times every episode.

My kid is not allowed to watch this crap anymore.

Horrifying
I am so happy to see I’m not the only one who sees how transparent this show is. I feel so sorry for Ryan. I make it clear that I do not like this show to my son, but also make it clear that it’s not Ryan I don’t like. It’s his mother’s exploitation of him that I despise. She is clearly in it for the money, and is so fake and absolutely obnoxious. From the first time I heard that screech of a voice, I’ve been cringing. Ryan seems like a sweet kid, but his manners are far from good and my son(age 3) has been repeating his actions, and it’s embarrassing. If Ryan lived in the real world, the poor boy would be labeled as socially awkward due to his parents putting him in a YouTube/fame/money bubble. I’m scared to see what the gold digger mom has up next for those little girls... get your family off tv and make some REAL memories.

Good for kids, bad for hateful parents
This is just a channel that showcases a kid who plays with toys. Kids feel connected to him. The parent reviews here are atrocious. Making comments on the parents voices or about the kid himself. If he threatens you that much, stay off the internet. Create your own content to keep you kids busy. Its entertainment calm down its not that serious

Please stop this show. Very annoying and an useless show, which doesn't add any value but has made my 3yr old son very addicted to this show..He throws things, smashes everything and says Ryan does it...We are very frustrated with this show and we cant see our son getting spoilt like this. You tube has to do something about this. I'm not able to block it too.

Inspiring, Interesting, and Fun
What a dream to be able to be successful, just doing fun things with your kids that they like to do, I'd pick spending time with my kid over my job any day, there are lots of good educational videos, and lots of inspiring places they go, some they don't say the name of the place though, like the slide farm, and I like to watch videos of toys before I buy them, I think ryan sounds like the home alone kid, his parents seem to have a good positive attitude, they do a lot of things most parents just don't do, like pretend play, dress up, challenges, puppets, crafts, experiments, many kids that are watching this are most likely being handed a device to watch, instead of interacting because their parents are probably busy, or just don't know how to play anymore being an adult, and taking care of necessities, and I think that's why it's so popular, but i also think mom, and dad would have to be money hungry, with as much as they got, and still going for more, or maybe they just like the job of being that person in a kids life to share good times with and try to give them a happy experience, but I hope ryan is truly happy too, but I just don't see how ryan could possibly have any more endorphins left for the next video filled with more plastic toys, but if he really is happy then that is Great.

Seriously?
Honestly, my kids watch this and it makes my stomach turn. The content is complete garbage. The mother is literally a walking talking commercial. They have made their child into a brand. They let Ryan act however he wants, disrespect is ignored. The Mom just makes me sick. The toys are junk. And if you're worth 80 million dollars, earned from our kids watching your videos, don't you think you could invest in some good screenwriters? And please, the title is not even proper English!

And Ryan's Mom, you're not cute. Just stop.
Thanks

3 words... The mother's voice
It could be cute and tolerable to watch if it weren't for the mothers voice. It is the screeshiest most nasally voice I have ever heard. But her laugh is 100× worse than her speaking voice. And it's made worse by her forced laughter. She laughs over everything, probably to add enthusiasm to the episodes. But not only is it forced, it's LOUD!!! I make my kids forn the volume down or put on headphones. Watch at your own risk. But beware, her laugh may shatter your windows and shake your dental fillings out.

Worst vlog
I normally don’t bother with writing reviews but this YouTube channel is so bad that I had to warn other parents to take caution in letting their kids watch. My kids stumbled upon this channel and I have had to restrict my kids from watching. A you tube channel dedicated to reviewing toys? Please. All I see is a spoiled child with parents that are teaching their kid to value materialistic things above all else. Not to mention the voices of the parents are grating. I’m sure this channel was just meant to be fun but out of all of the channels that review toys, this is the worst

DISGRACE!
This mother (father I feel, is an unwilling participant) is a perfect example of a women willing to exploit her own children, at any length to "make a buck"! She isnt fooling anyone. I have forbid my daughters from watching this marketing scheme. As soon as this Ryan kid hits the awkward ages, she dumps him and moves to the twin girls. I cannot believe we live in a society where ANY parent would let their kids watch this garbage or buy the toys to contribute to this CHILD ABUSE!
