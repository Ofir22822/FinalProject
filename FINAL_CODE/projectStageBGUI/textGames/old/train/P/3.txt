SEE IT
Device 6 explores the concept of narrative and choice by using text to take you on a surreal journey. Though Device 6 is mainly a text-based title, the game is not really a "text adventure."

Blizzard may not make a ton of games, but the games it does make always have an impact. Starcraft turned real-time strategy into a televised sport. World of Warcraft created a massively multiplayer online world that's arguably better than the real world. Then, the Warcraft spin-off Hearthstone demonstrated that a virtual trading-card game can be arguably better than real-world card games. Even if you've never built a deck or played a single session of WoW, Hearthstone will draw you in with its complex but approachable card battling system and not-horrible use of in-app purchases.
