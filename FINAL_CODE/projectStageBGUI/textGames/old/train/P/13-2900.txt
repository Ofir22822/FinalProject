Quick to playStraight-up bonkersEasy to understandA bit simplistic
If you’re looking for a quick and quirky game to enjoy with friends, Exploding Kittens is perfect. The premise is incredibly simple: each player needs to draw a single card from the deck and hope they don’t get an exploding kitten. Because if that happens, you’re out of the game - you've blown up (sorry). The winner is the person who doesn't end up being blasted to smithereens.

How do you avoid meeting an explosive end? You've got a hand of cards that help you turn the tables. Some contain ways to skip your turn or defuse kittens. Others let you know what card is going to be drawn next. Essentially, you can get rather clever with it if you have enough practice. You might see that an exploding kitten is on the way thanks to a special card before rearranging the deck to ensure your opponent draws it, for example. It's devious and wonderful (plus, each card is covered in bonkers artwork that is suitably weird).

Because you can get through a game in about 10-15 minutes, it’s an ideal palette cleanser in between bigger board game or card game sessions. There are various expansions to help you make more of Exploding Kittens if you get properly hooked as well. That makes it one of the best card games out there right now.

Fast-pacedVery moreishEasy to graspDifficult to master
Sushi Go! is a bizarre and wonderful little game for all ages; it's easy to understand, quick, and supremely moreish too. You'll find yourself coming back time and time again, especially because each game can be wrapped up in under 15 minutes. It's a simple concept but very, very effective.

The game challenges you to create the most appetising 'meal' from a deck of cards being passed from player to player. You do this by collecting sets of items - like wasabi or dumplings - to build up points. Because some are worth more than others (and certain cards only pay up if you've got the most), this results in an amusing battle over the best cards. You'll also need to think on your feet - things change fast in the surprisingly cutthroat world of sushi. Seriously, Gordon Ramsay would feel right at home here.

HilariousEasy to understandMemorableHumor can go too far
There's no way you can make a 'best card games' list and not mention Cards Against Humanity. This deliciously evil pastime has become infamous since it launched in 2011; it has a wicked, often-offensive sense of humor that's definitely NSFW. Crammed with swears and hysterical possibilities, this is one of the more memorable card games out there - indeed, it's a must-have for parties.

The way it works is simple. One of you draws a card with an innocent sentence written on it, but there are blanks that need filling ("Hey Reddit! I'm [Blank]. Ask me anything"). Players then select a response from their hand of cards, and whoever's choice is funniest gets the point. Because most of these responses are inappropriate, lewd, weird, or all of the above, the results are truly something to behold. An avalanche of expansions also make sure it doesn't lose its novelty too fast.

Easy to understandHilariousVaried card effectsRequires some improv skill
Gloom is a game about making people miserable. Don't get the wrong idea, though -  playing it is a hoot. You'll be meddling in the affairs of a Victorian family who look like extras from a Tim Burton movie, and everyone uses cards to depress them as much as possible before killing the poor blighters off for points (Mister Giggles might be mauled by manatees, for example). The more glum they are when they kick the bucket, the more points you get. 

So, what's the challenge? Your opponents will be trying to undo your work by cheering up members of your family. It's a delightful twist on the norm, and we're all for it. In fact, what sets Gloom apart is the glee with which it encourages you to foist misery on your victims. You'll tell the story of the unfortunate, implausible events that have befallen them, and most of the fun is making each other laugh by being as sadistic as possible. The word 'macabre' was practically invented for this game.

Awesome pixel artCool themeBe the villain... ugh, math
There's something deliciously evil about Boss Monster. It flips the idea of traditional dungeon crawls by making you the villain at the end. Your objective? Tempt in adventurers and kill them off for points. Even though it features math-based rules, boosts, and multipliers, it's also pretty straightforward to play once you've gotten your head around it. That leaves you room to get creative, screw over other players, and steal their heroes. It's a blast.

Gorgeous pixel art and packaging that seems drawn from the NES heyday only adds to its appeal. In fact, Boss Monster is an unashamed love letter to the 16-bit days of fantasy video games. And while it suffers a little with just two players, a full roster of four is a lot of fun. With sessions running for just 20-30 minutes and loads of replay value, it's a great choice for games night.

HystericalOpportunity for bizarre storiesGreat cartoonsDefinitely an 18+ game
If you're a fan of Cards Against Humanity, this devilish and NSFW alternative will be right up your street. It follows the same format as that game (fill in the blanks with the funniest response) but uses pictures instead of words to hilarious effect. Based on the tongue-in-cheek cartoons of Cyanide and Happiness, two cards - one random, the other chosen by a player from their hand - begin a story. Everyone else has to finish it with a card of their own. The most amusing response gets a point. It's easy to get into and you'll be playing in no time.

And don't worry, finding something funny isn't hard either. The drawings are snort-out-loud daft and all kinds of inappropriate. What's more, the sheer volume on offer (to say nothing of expansions) gives it plenty of replay-value. Just remember, this isn't a family friendly game.

Oodles of tensionExcitingBetrayals are a lot of funCan destroy friendships
Are you a good liar? Can you tell when your friends are lying to you? This game puts that to the test. The Resistance casts you as a band of freedom fighters who are battling to take down a corrupt government, but there are traitors amongst your crew. The rebels must win three out of five of their missions in order to claim victory, but the anonymous spies will do everything they can to make sure that doesn't happen - all in secret and from within.

This results in tense but thrilling games of cat and mouse. Who do you trust? And how will you know if they're pulling the wool over your eyes? If you're a traitor, would you rather throw a fellow spy under the bus if it means you remain undetected? As the blurb itself reads, The Resistance isn't messing around - "choose your teams carefully or forever lose your freedom".

Charming artworkTactical and deviousA good poker face isn't essentialIsn't all that easy to understand
Ever fancied yourself as an armchair detective? Now it's time to put those skills to the test. There's a murderer amongst you in Agatha Christie's Death on the Cards, and the other players have to catch them before they make good their escape. The catch? You've got no idea who they are. They'll also be working behind the scenes to derail your investigation. That means you'll need help from the likes of Poirot and Miss Marple if you want to bust this case wide open. 

To complicate matters further, everyone's got something to hide. In a very literal sense, that is - each player receives three 'secret' cards at the beginning of the game, and you're out if they all get revealed. The trouble is, uncovering secrets is the only way you can reveal the murderer. Cue mistrust, misdirection, and a whole load of bluffing. Not that you need a good poker face to win; in a pleasant twist, the mechanics are strong enough that tactics alone can earn you victory.

Unique gameplayFun event cardsPlayable period dramaA bit niche
Stop! I see you scrolling past this game because you think it’s for ‘dreamy girls’ or fans of stuffy old Georgian literature. But if you miss out on Marrying Mr Darcy you are, frankly, skipping one of the most entertaining games on this list. The basic idea is to pick a debutant from Jane Austin’s Pride and Prejudice before attempting to bag yourself a man. If you roleplay it and really get into the historical bitchiness of the whole game, it’s heaps of fun, especially when you start screwing over your opponents. 

You begin by playing the Courtship stage, where you take it in turns to draw event cards that allow you to build up your own eligibility, or ruin the chances of your opponents (spoiling the chances of someone else getting a good marriage is almost as entertaining as getting one yourself). Then you move on to the Proposal stage, which sees you competing for the hand of whichever suitors you qualify to marry. It’s a simple game, but very replayable, and the levels of cunning and scheming you can achieve make it seriously entertaining, even if you have no interest in Georgian literature, social scandals, or getting yourself Mr Darcy. And, if you want more spice, there’s a great Undead Expansion that riffs off the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel.

Cleverly translates superpowers to tabletopMakes good use of alter-egosDeep but not overwhelming strategyTakes a few rounds to get into
Superheroes have conquered almost every medium from movies to audio-books in the last few years, so it's not surprising to see them make the transition to card games with Marvel Champions. Fortunately, this isn't a cynical cash-in. It's a fun but strategic deck-building game that smartly translates its characters' abilities to the tabletop. Because it's developed by Fantasy Flight, you also know you're in for a high-quality product that'll be supported for years to come.

Your aim is to reduce the villain's health to zero before they achieve their nefarious goal, but players will need to make smart use of allies, abilities, and upgrades to do so. Intriguingly, that includes calling upon a superhero's alter-ego. For instance, Spider-Man can interrupt villain attacks while Peter Parker gains resources that are essential for deploying more cards. It's a cool tip of the hat to the one of the genre's most beloved tropes.

Marvel Champions is excellent fan-service, too - it calls upon a broad range of heroes from the classic to the obscure. Although Iron Man, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk are here, so are the likes of Hellcat. Much like everything else in this game, it's a cool tribute to over fifty years of comic book history fans will love.
