Beastie Bay
Price: Free to play

Beastie Bay is by Kairosoft and it’s one of the more underrated games like Pokemon. This game is a mixture of a monster catching and a sim so you’ll have quite a bit to do. The simulation side of it has you building a city, planting crops, and managing all of its resources. You then go out into the wilderness, catch beasts, trade them, and battle them. There is a ton of game here and it should keep you busy for a long time. It’s a free to play game so there are some undesirable elements. By and large, Kairosoft does good with this one.

Digimon is one of Pokemon’s biggest competitors and Digimon ReArise is the latest mobile game in the Digimon universe.

Emulators
Price: Free

There are a bunch of older Pokemon games on handheld consoles you can’t buy anymore. Thus, it makes sense to try them on an emulator. There are some decent ones, such as John GBAC for Game Boy Color and DraStic DS Emulator for the Nintendo DS. Recently, Citra (still in beta) launched for the Nintendo 3DS as well. Simply get these emulators, find the games, and play. Most emulators have the basics like fast forward modes, save and load states, cheat code support, and more. This was the only way to actually play Pokemon on mobile for a long time and it’s still a great way to play the classics.

MonsterCrafter
Price: Free to play

MonsterCrafter is one the more unique games like Pokemon. This game lets you create your own monsters instead of giving you a set number to collect.

You simply build a creature and then battle it against other players. It’s a free to play game, but it’s definitely a neat premise with a lot of potential customization options.

The free demo is actually a prequel to the main game and you can port your save to the main version if you decide to buy it. It’s quite expensive at $19.99 but there are no extra in-app purchases to gum up the works. Most of the complaints are minor, especially with recent updates to fix a lot of the issues.
