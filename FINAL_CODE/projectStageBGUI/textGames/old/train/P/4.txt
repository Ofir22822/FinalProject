The concept of virtual reality (VR) has been around for several decades, but, until recently, even the best VR headsets were not very accessible to consumers from either a cost or usability standpoint. Apart from a few cool demos, VR seemed like vaporware. Now, however, headsets are becoming less reliant on external hardware, and developers are creating first-party games that take full advantage of the medium. Fans of nearly every genre have excellent choices and should find at least a few games of interest in our roundup.

VR Hardware for Gaming
Our list of VR games covers the top titles for the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S (the successor to the Oculus Rift), PlayStation VR, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Many of these devices (and the games themselves) have gotten cheaper in the past couple of years, which makes them a more easily justifiable purchase.

If you choose the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift S, Valve Index, or a Windows Mixed Reality headset, keep in mind that you also need a powerful gaming desktop or VR-ready laptop to push pixels to the headset displays. For the best possible experience, make sure to find systems equipped with speedy CPUs, top-of-the-line GPUs, and a sufficient number of USB ports for connecting all these peripherals. PS4 players are lucky that they don’t have to worry about specs; any PS4 or PS4 Pro will work with the PlayStation VR headset. Some VR products, such as the Oculus Quest, are mostly self-contained units, though you can connect the Quest to a PC to power more graphically intense experiences.

What's Not Here?
The standalone Oculus Go headset is a less pricey entry into the VR fray, but we don’t specifically cover compatible experiences for that system here. Other VR and augmented reality (AR) platforms, such as Microsoft’s HoloLens and Samsung Gear VR are not included in this list either, as those headsets are intended for a different audience altogether. HoloLens, for example, has more professional and commercial applications. Nintendo Switch has also made a push for virtual reality with its recent Labo VR Kit, but that platform is also beyond the scope of this roundup. Google Daydream is sadly discontinued now.

Do you have any favorite VR titles that didn’t make the list or disagree with any of our choices? Send in your top picks. We’ll update this story from time to time, so your choice could appear in the next update.

Platform: PlayStation VR

In this action platformer, you must rescue the various members of your crew, which is scattered across space. The game offers 20 different main levels and 26 challenge levels, which should keep you entertained for a long time. This isn’t a simple platforming title.

Beat Saber


Beat Saber
$29.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

Beat Saber is a music and rhythm game with an active twist. The setup is similar to other music games, such as Audiosurf, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band, but instead of controlling a virtual ship or using fake instruments, you slash your way through a song with virtual laser swords. As the music plays, Beat Saber generates different patterns of color-coded blocks on the screen that you must hit with the correct controller (right or left) as they slide towards you. Obstacles also appear at times that require you to duck or slide away. Make no mistake, Beat Saber is not a game you can play sitting down; it’s a very active experience. If you love music and motion, Beat Saber is definitely worth exploring.

Budget Cuts


Budget Cuts
$29.99 at Steam

Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; Valve index

Will you let robots take your all-important paper-stamping and document-filing job? In this game, cost-cutting robots try to terminate your employment by any means necessary. You must fight your way through an office environment to save your job (and your life) using stealth tactics or by resorting to aggressive violence. AI and automation technologies are certainly poised to take over some real-world jobs previously filled by humans, so this game's hook is all too real.

Everybody's Golf

The game supports the PlayStation Move controller for more dynamic golfing action.

Farpoint


Farpoint
$16.77 at Amazon
SEE IT
Platform: PlayStation VR

Farpoint is a showcase title for the PS4’s VR capabilities and the first game to use the PS VR Aim, a gun-shaped controller specifically designed for first-person shooters. Sony says the VR Aim is capable of tracking player movements on a 1:1 scale, which creates a realistic feel to the game’s shooting mechanics. In Farpoint, you must survive deadly enemy encounters while traversing a dangerous alien environment in an effort to discover what happened to the rest of your research team. Farpoint is a relatively short experience, but it’s still worthwhile for PlayStation owners.

Half-Life: Alyx


Half-Life: Alyx
$59.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

It's not Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2: Episode Three, but Half-Life: Alyx is the first full-fledged Half Life game that Valve has released in a long time. The game's events take place after the original Half Life, but before Half-Life 2. As the title suggests, you play fan-favorite character Alyx Vance. Throughout the roughly 11-hour campaign, you take on enemy Combine forces and seek to advance research on their weaknesses. Valve built this experience specifically for VR, so expect impressive physics mechanics and top-tier graphics.

I Expect You To Die

Job Simulator


Job Simulator
$19.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

Why limit yourself to one job, when you could work several more in virtual reality? PCMag has certainly seen its share of weird simulation games, but VR elements add a whole new level of immersion. In Job Simulator, you experience such exciting careers as a mechanic, a gourmet chef, or the most coveted position of them all, an office worker. Make sure to take full advantage of the new and never-ending Infinite Overtime mode.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes


Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
$14.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR: Valve Index

Do you ever wonder how much you can really trust your friends? Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is the perfect multiplayer game to put your friendships to the test, forcing you to communicate and collaborate with each other to defuse a complex bomb. In this game, players are split into two groups: one Defuser and several Experts. Defusers can see and examine the bomb, but cannot access the manual. Experts can read the manual, but cannot see the bomb. Players must exchange information, guide each other through defusal steps, and keep track of progress if anyone wants to make it out alive. Keep in mind that bombs have a countdown timer and will explode if you make too many mistakes along the way.

Lone Echo


Lone Echo
$39.99 at Oculus

Platforms: Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S

Lone Echo is an immersive, single-player experience, in which you, as an AI entity named Jack, must help your captain unravel a dangerous mystery.

Minecraft VR


Minecraft VR
Free at Oculus

Platforms: Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; Windows Mixed Reality

Minecraft exists on nearly every platform you can name, including the VR space. For the uninitiated, Minecraft is an exploration, creation, and survival game all rolled into one with a distinct, low-poly aesthetic. The game adds a series of control enhancements for the VR platform, including 3D audio, a virtual living room mode (for a break from the first-person perspective), VR Turning (snaps head swiveling motions to increments to prevent disorientation), and VR Controls (makes in-games tasks easier to manage). Minecraft VR also supports multiplayer game modes, so you can enjoy the experience with your friends.

No Man's Sky


No Man's Sky (for PC)
4.0
$53.99 at Green Man Gaming
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index

After a disappointing launch in 2016, many people wrote off No Man’s Sky. Now, after years of consistent, major updates, the latest of which is a new VR Mode, No Man’s Sky is worth reconsidering. The basic goal of the game is to reach the center of the universe, but that sells the experience short by a long shot. Along the way, you can explore as many of the game’s innumerable procedurally generated planets as you want, build a home base, and battle enemy ships in space.

Pistol Whip


Pistol Whip
$24.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR (Summer 2020); Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

If you combined Beat Saber and Superhot, you'd get something close to Pistol Whip. This musical combat experience doesn't require you to match a certain rhythm with your gunplay, but rather gives you the freedom to take out enemies however you see fit. Get ready for frenetic action set to a high-energy soundtrack and flashy, colorful graphics.

Project Cars 2


Project Cars 2
$59.99 at Humble Bundle
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; Valve Index

Project Cars 2 straps you into the driver’s seat in a realistic, circuit racing experience. The game recreates the sensation of real-world driving down to the last detail, from breaking assistance systems to the positioning of your hands on the steering wheel. You can even disable the HUD if you want to go for absolute realism. The visual and environmental effects of Projects Cars 2 are what make it stand out. The textures of its 180+ car lineup, for example, look superb, while the weather and terrain systems add a level of sophistication. Consider hooking up pedals and a steering wheel to inch closer to your dream of owning a high-tech automobile.

Rez: Infinite


Rez: Infinite
$24.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index

The cult classic rail shooter, Rez, is now available for VR platforms. Rez is the story of a computer virus (Swayzak) on a mission through the network of a system called Project-K to save Eden (the system’s controlling AI) from self-destruction. On your way to Eden, you must overcome whatever obstacles get in your way, whether they be pesky firewalls or other viruses. Rez Infinite faithfully recreates all five original levels of gameplay and adds Area X, a new level that gives players full freedom of movement. This latest version also features full 1080p textures and 3D audio (which should only enhance Rez’s much-extolled and rhythmic soundtrack).

Robo Recall

Platforms: Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S

Robo Recall is an action-packed gallery shooter designed for use with the Oculus Touch controllers.

Space Junkies


Space Junkies
$19.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index

Ubisoft’s Space Junkies is an arcade shooter set against the backdrop of space. In the game, you battle enemies with futuristic weapons inside orbital arenas, which affords you full (and ever-disorienting) freedom of movement. You can fight enemies 1-on-1 or team up with a friend to take on pairs of combatants. After all, more players means more multiplayer mayhem.

Space Pirate Trainer


Space Pirate Trainer
$14.99 at Steam

Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

Space Pirate Trainer is an arcade shooter perfectly suited to the VR platform. In the game, your task is to shoot down incoming space enemies using your dual blasters (and other weapons or upgrades you pick) along your way to the top of the Space Pirate leaderboard. Keep in mind that you won’t get very far without actively engaging with the game. That’s right; you have to physically dodge and avoid incoming attacks, in addition to returning fire at droids. Space Pirate Trainer obviously takes place in space, and employs a vibrant and realistic art style that fits well with its fast-paced action.

Subnautica


Subnautica
$24.99 at Steam
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; Valve Index

Subnautica is an adventure and exploration game set in the near future. After a passenger spaceship crash lands on an ocean planet called 4546B, your player is left stranded and unreachable due to an ancient alien defense system stationed on the island, called the Quarantine Enforcement Platform. Eventually, you receive instructions on how to escape the planet, but before doing so you must disable the defense system. In the meantime, you must also maintain your character’s health and build tools and infrastructure with the resources from the 4546B’s aquatic environment. As you progress, you’ll start to uncover more of the planet’s ancient narrative. Subnautica’s vast ocean system is a visual treat, so make sure to spend some time with the nautical wildlife.

Superhot


Superhot VR
4.0
$19.99 at Amazon
SEE IT
Platforms: HTC Vive; Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S; PlayStation VR; Valve Index; Windows Mixed Reality

Superhot is a time-bending and stylish shooter; when you stop moving, so too does the world around you. The gameplay and feedback loop is quite addictive. In particular, levels load and restart quickly, which makes it easy to stay focused on the challenge at hand until you prevail and move on to the next stage. To complete a level, you need to defeat all of the bright red enemies barreling towards you, who in turn, are trying to eliminate you. Players must use their wits, fists, guns, swords, and any other objects (items like coffee mugs and water bottles are fair game) to stun, and ultimately obliterate, attackers. Keep in mind that a single bullet can eliminate both you and your enemies, so keep tabs on every weapon discharge.

Tetris has existed in many forms over the better part of the last three decades. Tetris Effect is the latest iteration, and perhaps one of the best ever.

As you progress, you unlock new effects and stages.

The Climb


The Climb
$29.99 at Oculus
SEE IT
Platform: Oculus Quest; Oculus Rift and Rift S

Crytek’s The Climb is an excellent example of using VR to effectively translate a real-world experience. In The Climb, you scale a series of precarious rock faces. You command your pair of virtual hands with a regular controller, or better yet, with the Oculus Touch controllers. Gameplay reflects actual climbing experiences (especially vertigo), so chart your path to the top carefully and use chalk to help retain your grip as you go along. The Climb currently features two climbing environments, the Bay and the North. Per The Climb’s site, the Bay is roughly based on Vietnam's Halong Bay, while the North takes inspiration from the Arctic Circle. Whichever locale you choose, Crytek’s engine is capable of creating breathtaking vistas.

The Lab

Ever wanted to revisit Aperture Labs after completing Portal 2? Valve’s The Lab returns you to the infamous former shower curtain manufacturers’ facility for a series of room-scale VR experiences. No, you don’t get to revisit the role of Chell. Instead, you get to explore a so-called pocket universe of Aperture Science. Some of the experiences include training tutorials (you can become a Calibration Trainee or repair robots) otherworldly endeavors (get up close with the solar system or dive into postcards of exotic locales), and interactive games (defend a castle with a bow and arrow or take on the role of an ace space pilot in an arcade dogfighting experience). All are excellent introductions to Valve's VR world.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR Edition

Skyrim remains one the most ambitious open-world games, even without VR capabilities; this version of the game adds an extra sense of immersion. Traverse the lands of Skyrim, interact with NPCs, and equip your character with weapons, armor, and spells. Ultimately, you are tasked with defeating Alduin, a so-called world-eating dragon, though you can equally spend your time exploring and completing side missions for townspeople. Even if you have already completed the game on another platform, Skyrim’s VR edition should keep you tied over until Elder Scrolls VI (announced at E3 2018), eventually releases.

If intellectual puzzle games appeal to you, prepare to sink many enjoyable hours into The Talos Principle VR. In the game, you play as an intelligent, anthropomorphic robot tasked with navigating mazes and obstacles across a series of mysterious environments laden with modern technology. Players can also go exploring off the beaten path to unravel some further backstory. As you progress through the narrative, you discover secrets about your world and yourself, all of which factor into a momentous decision. The game also looks beautiful, with highly realistic textures and lighting throughout.

This wacky game from Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty, pairs with you with the reluctant Trover as you try to rescue your dogs and save the universe in the process.
