Inside
Inside 
$19.99

Few video games receive perfect scores here at PCMag.com, but Inside is a title that qualifies as damn-near flawless. The action-adventure title features, at its core, a boy navigating a dark and deadly world. To go too deep into Inside's structure would both spoil the game and do it a disservice. Trust us: It's worth a pick up.

Papo & Yo
Papo & Yo 
$14.99

Papo & Yo, a puzzle-platformer from Minority, crossed over to PC from PlayStation Network with grace and style. This tale of a boy and a monster takes places in an imaginative world filled with South American-style houses, reason-defying physics, and a heartfelt story that explores the relationship between a child and an alcoholic, abusive parent.

Portal 2
Portal 2 
$19.99

Valve's original Portal was noteworthy for its witty and acerbic dialogue, creativity in blending the previously incompatible brain-teasing-puzzle-game and first-person-shooter genres, and relative shortness. With Portal 2, Valve has left intact the first quality, expanded and elaborated on the second, and done a bit to address the third. What this adds up to is a sequel that stands up proudly to the original, updating the characteristics that made it a distinctive success without dulling their memory. Limited multiplayer and post-campaign options slightly diminish the replay factor, but in almost every way Portal 2 is just as amusing and exhilarating as its predecessor.

Quantum Conundrum
Quantum Conundrum 
$8.99

The video game industry is dominated by space marines, regular marines, super-soldiers, and zombie-killers—the headshots and gun-blasts permeate the business. That's why it's particularly nice to see a clever title like Airtight Games and Square Enix's Quantum Conundrum, a project from Portal designer Kim Swift. The first-person puzzle game focuses on solving increasingly challenging puzzles using a dimension-shifting tool within a mansion filled with wacky inventions.

Scribblenauts Unlimited
Scribblenauts Unlimited 
$19.99

Scribblenauts Unlimited, 5th Cell's latest word-adventure title, lets creative gamers use a magic notebook to summon a wild array of items—from the mundane to the extravagant—as they attempt to reverse a spell that's turning their in-game sister, Lily, into stone. It's a very basic plot that kickstarts the action, but Scribblenauts Unlimited excels at sparking imagination as you attempt to solve puzzles. It's one the wordsmiths and imaginauts will love.

The Swapper
The Swapper 
$14.99

Imagine a game soup flavored with chunky bits of old school 2D Castlevania, Portal, and BioShock, and you still wouldn't get close to describing The Swapper. The game's not quite a platformer; it's a puzzle game, packaged with a brooding sci-fi story set in space. Finnish company Facepalm Games delivers a fascinating, memorable exploration title that can sustain at least two plays through because of multiple endings and achievements.

Best Racing PC Games
Forza Horizon 4
Forza Horizon 4 
$59.99

Some questioned Forza Horizon 4's necessity, given that the open-world racer debuted just two years after its excellent predecessor. But developer Playground Games has taken its incredible racing-and-music festival formula and added even more goodness, including new vehicles, fresh and addicting solo and multiplayer modes, and seasonal effects that impact the environment and change how you approach driving. Simply put, Forza Horizon 4 is the best racing game on PC.

Horizon Chase Turbo
Horizon Chase Turbo 
$19.99

It's easy to dismiss the retro vibe behind many pop culture phenomena as little more than shallow appeals to nostalgia. A handful of media properties have managed to dig deeper, however, creating more rewarding experiences. Horizon Chase Turbo zooms into that category thanks to simple, but thrilling, racing action inspired by 1980s and 1990s tiles like Rad Racer and Top Gear. Gamers weaned on Forza, Gran Turismo, and other contemporary racing titles may find Horizon Chase Turbo a tad shallow, but those who dig arcade-style racers with fast action, tight controls, and hummable music will find little fault in its simplicity.

Hotshot Racing
Hotshot Racing
$19.99

Hotshot Racing replicates 1990s-era, arcade-style driving competitions, with its pick-up-and-play control scheme and angular, low-polygon visual aesthetic. In many ways, the title, developed by Lucky Mountain Games (with an assist from the racing masters at Sumo Digital), captures the retro-racing vibe, but it lacks those games' classic, awe-inspiring level designs. Still, it's worth a spin for anyone looking for a satisfying throwback racing experience.

Need for Speed Heat
Need for Speed Heat 
$59.99

Tense police pursuits are common in Need for Speed Heat, and not all of them end with a getaway. This latest entry in the long-running Need for Speed racing game series recreates some of the best aspects of previous titles, including engrossing chases, ample car customization options, and inviting arcade-like racing mechanics. Heat also features a more fitting setting and story than the last game, tapping into the adrenaline-fueled racing spirit that defined its most successful predecessors.

Ridge Racer Unbounded
Ridge Racer Unbounded 
$9.99

The Ridge Racer series may not carry Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport's swagger, but the long-running franchise has a dedicated fan base that loves the drift-centric racing action. This entry, crafted by Bugbear Entertainment, brings a chaotic element to the familiar gameplay by adding environmental and vehicular destruction as you race for street cred in the fictional Shatter Bay. The story is something you can flat out ignore—it's a racing game, after all—but the driving action is interesting and varied. Just play against human opponents if you wish to maintain your sanity.

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection
Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection 
$19.99

After Sega exited the hardware business in the early 2000s, the game publisher focused its attention on its money maker—Sonic the Hedgehog—to the detriment of its other characters. That changed with the 2010's Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, an enjoyable racing game that put Sega's many iconic game characters in a kart competition. Its sequel, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, expanded the game with new characters and unlockables, and introduced transformable vehicles that take to the land, sea, and air. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection, the series' final form, adds free, PC-centric characters from Sega and Valve's libraries and bundles all the previous DLC goodies.

Split/Second
Split/Second 
$19.99

Do you crave a game in which you drive fast cars and cause mass destruction? Framed around a fictional reality television program, Split/Second merges arcade-style racing and huge, environment-wrecking explosions to form an addictive, thrilling racer that will keep you hugging corners, jockeying for position, and downing jumbo jets well into the night. That said, Split/Second is not without flaws: The online servers are dead, there's some screen tearing, and the game could benefit from additional environments. Still, if you're looking for a PC racing game that isn't aimed at the Top Gear crowd, Split/Second is a PC game you'll want in your Steam library.

Best RPG & Roguelike PC Games
Dark Souls II
Dark Souls II 
$39.99

Dark Souls returns to the PC, and it's every bit as terrifying as you may have heard. Don't worry, Dark Souls II avoids the missteps of its predecessor's infamous port, allowing you to focus on the rich, gloomy action-RPG world and fantastic, unforgiving gameplay. Dark Souls II is a relentless barrage of demonic enemies and enraging boss encounters that will test your reflexes—and your patience. This is not a game for the faint of heart or quick of temper, so clear your desk of ceramics, take the framed pictures off the walls, and prepare to enter the dark world of Drangleic.

Dark Souls III
Dark Souls III 
$59.99

Dark Souls III is developer From Software's return to the Souls series after the eldritch madness that was Bloodborne. In fact, the newest Souls game incorporates gameplay and design elements from virtually all of the team's recent titles. As a result, the gorgeous and action-packed Dark Souls III feels highly familiar, yet fresh and content-rich at the same time. Like all of From Software's launches, however, the game is in need of a few patches to adjust weapon balance. Nonetheless, Dark Souls III is easily one of the best games in the series.

Diablo III: Reaper of Souls
Diablo III: Reaper of Souls 
$39.99

Blizzard seems to be one of the few companies committed to sticking with old-school expansions for its games and not just DLC packs. World of Warcraft received several large, and full-priced expansions, as did Diablo III, with Reaper of Souls. The add-on contains a good chunk of content that, with some much-needed tweaks to the base Diablo III, make the whole game feel fresh and fun.

Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen 
$29.99

Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a single-player RPG, with action-driven gameplay akin to Capcom's Devil May Cry and Monster Hunter franchises. It draws inspiration from classic fables and myths, setting the game in a world burdened with the return of a destructive red dragon. Its combat is flashy and engaging, and the open-world environments are rich with detail, but the quest-driven plot and sparse character development weaken what would be an otherwise interesting story. The RPG leveling stalls combat, as well, so you won't fight at your full potential until you've leveled your class sufficiently. These issues may turn off less patient players, but those hoping for a grand, long-lived adventure across an action-packed open world will find plenty to discover and enjoy.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 
$19.99

Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series has consistently been on the front lines of RPG immersion, giving you ever bigger and more elaborate realms to explore. The quantum strides made in Morrowind (2002) and Oblivion (2006) continue in Skyrim, which provides the most delicious perspective to date on this fascinating world over which you have almost complete control. It's no challenge to set yourself up as a warrior, a wizard, or a pickpocketing miscreant, of either gender, of any of ten species, and with just the physical and facial characteristics you desire.

Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster
Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster 
$29.99

Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster bundles the celebrated tenth installment of the main Final Fantasy series, and its sequel, into one stellar role-playing game package that Square Enix fans will adore. Both role-playing games boast graphical overhauls that enhance the beauty of their worlds and newly added features not found in the console versions. Ain't PC gaming grand?

Horizon Zero Dawn
Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition
$49.99

Horizon Zero Dawn was one of 2017's hottest games. It stood as one of the best PlayStation 4 exclusives, right up there with Bloodborne, Spider-Man, and the God of War reimagining. Now, you can enjoy its open-world action on PC, thanks to the Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition. This action-RPG contains the base game, plus The Frozen Wilds DLC (an additional area featuring more story content and collectibles), and it easily holds up today as a huge, dense, worthwhile adventure.

Mass Effect: Andromeda
Mass Effect: Andromeda 
$59.99

With Mass Effect: Andromeda, developer BioWare promised a game that would feature a compelling story, fantastic visuals, tight gameplay, and hot alien romance—unfortunately, the action-RPG delivers on only a few of those fronts. On the upside, the space opera has several sizable open-world environments to explore and a thrilling combat system. On the downside, it has infamously awkward animations, tedious menus, and performance issues. Nonetheless, if you're looking to blast aliens with zany space magic or woo an exotic space lady or gentleman, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game that has some entertaining elements that are worth your time.

Mass Effect 2
Mass Effect 2 
$19.99

The BioWare-developed Mass Effect 2 picks up exactly where the original space opera left off. In fact, one of the great things about this RPG, beside the incredible character development, is that you can upload your character from last game directly into this one. In terms of fresh features, there's a new cover system, and a revamped health recovery system lets you heal most wounds by camping out of harm's way. Although Mass Effect 2 is much more shooter-like than the original, role-playing is still at the game's core.

Mass Effect 3
Mass Effect 3 
$19.99

When the fate of the galaxy is in your hands, how often does it feel like it's really in your hands? It does in Mass Effect 3. Picking up where Mass Effect 2 left off, Mass Effect 3 thrusts you back into the persona of Commander Shepard, who's standing at the brink of one of the most daunting challenges ever. He's tasked with nothing less than rescuing the Earth, and the entire Milky Way, from the clutches of the all-consuming Reapers that are threatening them as never before. Packed with action, character development, and customizability that transcend what you find in most games, Mass Effect 3 is an entertaining and frequently engrossing trip into the psychology of helplessness, if one that doesn't realize all of its towering ambitions.

Monster Hunter World
Monster Hunter World 
$59.99

Even Monster Hunter's most rabid fans admit that there's a certain level of gameplay jank that you need to live with in order to enjoy the creature-slaying series, a jankiness that has turned many people away. But with Monster Hunter World, Capcom enhanced animations, streamlined gameplay, and made tons of quality-of-life adjustments designed to appeal to core and casual audiences alike. And the moves worked. Tracking and battling huge, snarling beasts with a variety of crafted armor and weaponry is an absolute joy, especially while doing so with friends in multiplayer mode

Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom 
$59.99

Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a heartwarming adventure that resurrects the wonder and chibi-world aesthetic of classic role-playing games like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. Developed by Level-5 in collaboration with former Studio Ghibli character designer Yoshiyuki Momose and composer Joe Hisashi, Ni No Kuni II is an audio-visual treat that leads you through a world seemingly crafted from a child's imagination. Revenant Kingdom has some frame rate issues and doesn't offer many challenges, but it's a magical ride nonetheless.

Nier: Automata
Nier: Automata 
$59.99

Nier: Automata is an action-RPG developed by Platinum Games, the studio behind the Bayonetta games, and directed by Yoko Taro, the creator of the Drakengard series and the original Nier. Platinum Games' previous works excel on the gameplay front, but their stories are generally campy schlock. Taro's games, on the other hand, are brilliantly depressing stories tied together with weak gameplay. Nier: Automata is a marriage of Platinum Games' intense action combat and Taro's wacky, yet somber storytelling, and is easily one of the better games released in 2017, thanks to the hot android-on-robot combat. Unfortunately, Nier: Automata suffers from some technical issues. A lack of developer support compounds this, so you'll need to rely on fan-made patches if you want to get the very best performance out of the game.

Nioh
Nioh 
$49.99

Nioh is Team Ninja's first attempt at an action-RPG, and it shares a few superficial similarities with From Software's influential Dark Souls games. The player-summoning cooperative gameplay, corpse-run death system, shortcut-rich levels, and enemy-respawning checkpoints will all feel familiar to Dark Soul aficionados. However, Nioh is very much its own beast, and is filled with highly technical action and stronger narrative elements than the Souls titles. This Complete Edition includes the original console game, as well as all of the DLC content, so newcomers have dozens of hours of action to master. Perhaps to the game's detriment, Nioh has a mountain of systems that new players must learn before they can tackle the higher difficulties. Still, Nioh won't disappoint gamers hungry for a rich and immersive action game.

RymdResa
RymdResa 
$11.99

RymdResa is a fascinating PC game that features a narrative structure, music, and environments that play out like an art-house drama. While drifting through the emptiness of space, collecting resources and materials to survive, your character occasionally drops poetry gems via diary entries, while reflecting on the loneliness that vastness represents—as well as the depression, hope, and desire that comes with it. RymdResa features nearly zero in-game interactions, but the roguelike adventure game uses a single character and simple graphics to dissect the human psyche in a story that flirts with the possibility that we are one with the universe in more ways than we imagine.

South Park: The Fractured But Whole
South Park: The Fractured But Whole 
$59.99

It isn't very often a game comes along that presents a setting and story as unapologetically risqué as South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Naturally, The Stick of Truth fans know exactly what they're getting themselves into: topical, highly satirical, and utterly absurd South Park comedy that's paired with a deep, grid-based RPG combat system. It's a refreshing RPG, if only because the gameplay, hard language, ridiculous scenarios, and show references keep you smiling until the end. Fractured slips up once in a while; the superhero-themed exploration elements utilize some highly tedious menu switching and quick time event (QTE) mechanics, and the game is surprisingly buggy. However, if you can look past these issues, you're in for an enjoyable time.

Story of Season: Friends of Mineral Town
Story of Season: Friends of Mineral Town
$49.99

Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town is a farming simulator/RPG hybrid that looks and plays much like the classic Harvest Moon games. That's because it is Harvest Moon. A licensing spat between publishers forced a title change in 2014, but the game's heart and soul—ranching in a quaint town filled with quirky characters—remains the same. The polygonal visuals are a bit bland, and the controls are a touch clunky, but the game is wholesome, farm-sim fun.

Trials of Mana
Trials of Mana
$49.99

Trials of Mana, an action-RPG from the Super Famicom’s heyday, receives the remake treatment. Despite its fresh coat of paint, Trials of Mana is unabashedly retro and doesn’t shy away from 1990’s-esque dialogue and the vibrantly cartoonish world that made the Mana series a stand-out franchise among Square’s 1990s RPG lineup. Trials of Mana has a few faults, mainly spotty voice work and no co-op multiplayer action. Nonetheless, Trials of Mana is an excellent action-RPG that oozes charm and has enough content to keep you playing for some time.

Wasteland 2
Wasteland 2 
$39.99

Wasteland 2 is a return to the classic computer RPG conventions that have been largely absent in the contemporary gaming scene. CRPGs have seen a recent resurgence with the release of Divinity: Original Sin and Shadowrun, and developer InXile Entertainment has followed suit with a proper sequel to its 1988 classic. The core of any good CRPG is choice, and Wasteland 2 embraces this wholeheartedly. You can either choose from a list of premade characters or create a more specialized and customized party by allocating skill points and attributes. There is no single protagonist; instead, you control a party of Desert Rangers. Wasteland 2 isn't without flaws, however. The combat in particular is a tad underwhelming, but it's still an enjoyable return to post-apocalyptic Arizona and California.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 
$59.99

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the final installment in CD Projekt Red's action-RPG series. Geralt of Rivia sets out one last time to slay beasts, collect bounties, and protect the child of destiny. CD Projekt Red changes the game formula by introducing a massive, open world filled with monsters to hunt and quests to undertake. But it also greatly improves the series' combat by making alchemy more accessible and tightening the action controls. The rich story narrative that drives the game is rife with tragedy, folkloric horror, humor, and intrigue, keeping you on your toes every step of the way.

Xanadu Next
Xanadu Next 
$19.99

"Simplicity" is the word that best suits Xanadu Next. The action-RPG is an unabashedly uncomplicated game that features basic mouse controls and PlayStation One-era visuals. The simplicity, however, isn't detrimental to the game: Xanadu Next makes excellent use of its uncomplicated systems to deliver a fantastic dungeon-crawling experience that's well worth checking out. The game has a few minor issues that hold it back from action-RPG greatness, such as its clunky controller support and occasionally tedious progression. Still, Xanadu Next runs well, plays well, and oozes old-school RPG charm.

Ys: Memories of Celceta 
$24.99

Memories of Celceta is a Ys IV reimagining that sees longtime series hero Adol emerge without his memories from a forest that was previously said to have claimed the lives of all who entered it. Thankfully, Adol is still a skilled warrior who, along with a handful of uniquely skilled party members, is willing to hack and slash his way through hordes of monsters. This action-RPG may not have reliable party AI, but its combat, sense of exploration, and rocking tunes are excellent.

Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim 
$19.99

Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim is an excellent top-down hack-and-slash RPG by Japanese developer Nihon Falcom. Originally released exclusively for PCs in Japan, Ys VI was ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable by Konami in 2005 and made available around the world. This newer version of Ys VI features an XSEED localization that includes an improved translation, a more challenging game mode called Catastrophe Mode, enhanced graphical settings, and Steam support—features that more than make up for the missing content that was in the Konami-published port.

Best Shmup PC Games
Deathsmiles
Deathsmiles 
$19.99

Game studio Cave holds true to its promise of porting its shoot-em-up (or "shmup") catalog to Steam with the release of Deathsmiles. You play as one of five gothic lolitas who defend their land from a demon invasion using familiars and intense, enemy-wrecking firepower. It's a simple premise that's bolstered by huge enemies, big explosions, beautifully detailed environments, and a thrilling goth-rock score. All in all, Deathsmiles is a thoroughly enjoyable PC shooter, despite cramped environments and sprites that were already considered a bit dated at the time of its original 2007 arcade release.

DoDonPachi Resurrection
DoDonPachi Resurrection 
$29.99

The shoot-'em-up renaissance that's occurring on the PC has given us many pulse-pounding shmups, but none balance thrills and depth like DonDonPachi Resurrection. Developed by Cave, a company that's created many space-shooter classics, DoDonPachi Resurrection boasts high-powered offensive and defensive options for annihilating aliens. The game also has multiple ships, multiple endings, and local co-op play.

Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions
Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions 
$14.99

Top-down arcade shooters have been a video game staple for a long, long time. The 1980s saw Robotron: 2084 popularize the genre with easy to use twin-stick controls, while the 1990s added Arnold Schwarzenegger flair and Paul Verhoeven panache with Smash TV. Recently, the best shooter wasn't newfangled fare like Halo or Gears of War, but a simple gem called Geometry Wars. True to its title, sequel Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions takes the addictive shape-shooting action into the third dimension with near-immaculate results. The game is rendered with Tron-like grids, wire-framed objects that explode into kaleidoscopic fireworks as a Daft Punk-ish soundtrack pulses in the background. It's a feast for the senses.

Ikaruga
Ikaruga 
$9.99

Treasure, the development house that made its name crafting genre-defining and genre-breaking titles during the 16-bit and 32-bit console generations, applied its creative chops to the shoot-'em-up category in 2001 and released the renowned Ikaruga. It wasn't until 2016 that the game received a PC port, but the wait was worth it. Ikaruga is now available as a Steam game that retains the unique color-switching mechanic found in the previous arcade and console versions, but adds video uploads, numerous options, and a handful of Steam-specific features.

Mushihimesama
Mushihimesama 
$19.99

Death's frosty hand will grip us all in due time, but, fortunately, it's a one-and-done situation. We fight the inevitable but ultimately succumb without a repeated struggle. However, if you fire up Mushihimesama, a bullet hell shooter from developer Cave, you will die a lot, but may eventually cheat death should you master your guns and the ability to weave between waves of fat, neon-colored enemy bullets. This excellently crafted PC game doesn't do a very good job of introducing newcomers to its systems, but seasoned pilots will enjoy this game's huge insect enemies, awesome firepower, and many thrills.

Best Shooter PC Games
Battlefield 4
Battlefield 4 
$19.99

When it comes to evaluating any title in the Battlefield franchise, it's important to remember that the only reason anyone plays campaign mode is to unlock new weapons in multiplayer. Despite great voice acting by Michael K. Williams (Omar from The Wire), campaign mode is little more than a four to six hour tutorial teaching you how to play the game. Multiplayer combat, on the other hand, captures the awe of destruction. You can run across the battlefield, ducking in and out of cover, board a helicopter, hop on the mini-gun, cut enemies to shreds, then hop off the gun and repair the helicopter while in flight. It's all in a day's work on the battlefield.

Battlefield V
Battlefield V 
$59.99

Battlefield V looks gorgeous, plays fast, and encompasses all the hallmarks of a modern first-person shooter. It includes respectable single player content (War Stories), and new takes on multiplayer gameplay (Grand Operations), but both settle into genre norms. Battlefield V's most apparent drawback, however, is the complexity of its progression systems and somewhat repetitive gameplay. Overall, Battlefield V is a solid entry in the long-running Battlefield series and you should play it if you are a fan of previous titles. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking.

Bioshock Infinite
Bioshock Infinite 
$29.99

Shattered dreams form the foundation of BioShock Infinite, the third installment in Irrational Games' impressive saga exploring the devastating effects of isolation (and isolationism) on the human psyche. But even if you loved the original BioShock (2007) and its sequel, BioShock 2 (2010), this chapter won't leave you with the impression your dreams have been betrayed. Wedding familiar gameplay elements from the preceding titles with exciting new mechanics, an engrossing story, and stunning visual design, BioShock Infinite is the culmination of the series' aesthetic and its promise to turn a mirror on humanity by probing as deeply into the self as possible.

Borderlands 2
Borderlands 2 
$19.99

Gearbox Entertainment and 2K Games take you back to the warzone with Borderlands 2, the sequel to the hit apocalyptic RPG-shooter that isn't Fallout. If you played the original Borderlands, you understand this game. You play a Vault Hunter, a treasure hunter looking for an alien vault on the barely colonized planet of Pandora. While doing so, you cut a swath of death through thousands of Mad Max-style raiders, mutant animals, and robots. Throughout your adventure, you level up your character in an RPG-like fashion, and collect hundreds of different guns, each with its own unique stats and attributes.

Call of Duty: Black Ops
Call of Duty: Black Ops 
$39.99

Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops is less like a traditional first-person shooter than it is a plunge into someone else's fever dream. A jolting collection of intense action sequences, haunting writing, and ultra-dark humor, this installment in the popular franchise revitalized the historical-fiction FPS genre. Though its captivating campaign is on the short side, it's loaded with additional things to do, including cooperative and competitive multiplayer scenarios and plenty of unlockable extras.

Call of Duty: Black Ops II
Call of Duty: Black Ops II 
$59.99

Let's start with what will be the meat of the Black Ops II experience for many: multiplayer mode. Developer Treyarch has not toyed significantly with the formula, giving players numerous options for facing off against others across the country and around the globe. The missions include Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All, Search & Destroy, Capture the Flag, and eight others; you can also engage in two types of Combat Training runs to hone your skills, or play four Party Games that put interesting for-entertainment-only spins on the weapons you can use and the rules you play by.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 
$59.99

The Call of Duty franchise has experienced an identity crisis in recent years, with a focus shift from WWII battles to space adventures to battle royale. In other words, Call of Duty has strayed far from what made it an excellent first-person shooter franchise. Though Call of Duty games still dominate sales, publisher Activision and developer Infinity Ward felt the need to relive the series' Modern Warfare glory days with a reboot of the seminal 2007 title. The new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has the action-packed single-player and robust multi-player modes one expects from the series. It successfully strips away all superfluous elements and delivers an experience even non-shooter fans can enjoy.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 
Free

Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) debuted in 2012, backed by a strong heritage of multiplayer FPS titles, including the original Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source. Six years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and active community. Visually, however, CS: GO is starting to show its age, and it's not as thematically rich as popular titles like Overwatch. Still, many players will enjoy CS: GO's no-frills experience and highly competitive esports scene.

Doom
Doom 
$59.99

Don't let the non-numerical name fool you. Doom is the latest sequel in the hallowed series, and it's the best modern update one could hope for. It's also the best first-person-shooter in recent memory—so long as you stick to the gory, frantic, and lovingly satanic campaign. The multiplayer is lackluster and the DLC is a shame, but the real star, the single-player mode, blends old-school design with modern know-how to form a satisfying, unholy concoction.

Doom Eternal
Doom Eternal 
$59.99

With 2016's Doom, developer Id Software successfully resurrected one of the foundational first-person shooter franchises. Given the game's critical and commercial success, it's no surprise to see a follow-up. Doom Eternal takes everything that made its predecessor a wonderful, demon-slaying shooter and bumps it all up by several notches courtesy of ridiculous weapons, fresh navigation options, and new multiplayer mode. It is almost too over-the-top at points, but that's precisely what makes Doom Eternal one of the best shooters ever made.

Far Cry 4
Far Cry 4 
$49.99

Far Cry 4 is a fun sandbox of shooting with an interesting land to explore and tons of missions to find and collectibles to grab. It slavishly follows Far Cry 3's structure, but when the action is this entertaining, hard to complain. Far Cry 4 doesn't do much new, but it's an enjoyable and good-looking excuse to spend some hours stomping through jungles and sniping people from towers.

Gears 5
Gears 5 
$59.99

Although Gears 5 is the first main game in the long-running series to nix the "of War" suffix, make no mistake: The Gears world is still at war. The third-person shooter is the sixth entry in the franchise and a direct sequel to Gears of War 4, continuing the story of the Coalition of Ordered Government's (COG) fight against the Swarm. Gears 5's captivating storytelling, solid mechanics, and excellent graphics far outweigh this PC game's merely average multiplayer modes. It's an easy recommendation for longtime players of the Gears of War series and newcomers alike.

Gears of War 4
Gears of War 4 
$59.99

Gears of War 4, the newest entry in the series that defined cover-based shooting, brings satisfying alien-blasting action to PC. The Coalition-developed title offers a new team to fight with, new toys to play with, and all-new enemies to shred, either alone or with a friend. And, like Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4 is a part of Microsoft's Play Anywhere initiative, so you can play a digital copy on either a Windows 10 PC or Xbox One console with a single purchase—a nice perk. The gameplay grows a bit repetitive as the story progresses, but if you want to sneakily kill lots and lots of enemies, Gears of War 4 is a worthy pickup.

Gears of War: Ultimate Edition
Gears of War: Ultimate Edition 
$29.99

Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the first DirectX 12 PC title, just about sets the standard for what a remastered game should offer. The third-person shooter was already a great game when it debuted a decade ago on Xbox 360, but this updated title adds 4K resolution, unlocked frame rates, and content that was once paid DLC. That said, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition isn't perfect; it doesn't work well with AMD GPUs, bugs from the original game are still an issue, and it lacks some of the updated mechanics found in later Gears games. But if you own an Nvidia-powered gaming rig, you'll be good to go.

Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary
Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary
$9.99

Halo: Combat Evolved reimagined the first-person shooter genre for consoles and popularized many of the controls and functions that such games would use for decades afterward. Halo received an enhanced remake in 2011 for the Xbox 360 (Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary) that featured updated graphics and a toggle function that let you swap between Classic and Remastered visual styles. Now, that Anniversary edition gets updated with 4K graphics, ultrawide monitor support, and other features you'd expect from a contemporary PC game. It launched with a few bugs, but is generally a rock-solid good time. You can buy it as a standalone title or as part of the $39.99 Halo: Master Chief Collection.

Halo 2 Anniversary
Halo 2: Anniversary
$9.99

Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a nostalgic compilation featuring Microsoft's classic first-person shooter titles, but the reworked games launched with various bugs. Halo 2: Anniversary came out the gate in a better state than the games before it, but has multiplayer and graphical glitches. Still, this updated Halo 2 is a great shooter, as it features fast-paced shooting action, wonderfully overhauled 4K graphics, and the ability to dual-wield weapons.

Halo 3
Halo 3
$9.99

Halo 3 is a must-own shooter. It's easily the most polished Master Chief Collection game released to date, offering excellent shoot-from-the-hip action, cool new weapons and mechanics, and a dramatic conclusion to Halo 2's conflict. Plus, Halo 3 looks better than ever thanks to 4K assets. If you find yourself itching to replay it, or if you never had the chance to do so before, consider the game a fantastic buy.

Halo 5: Forge
Halo 5: Forge 
Free

It's easy to recommend Halo 5: Forge to anyone who's looking for a solid multiplayer shooter. Forge comes with a wealth of multiplayer modes, including the titular map-editing mode, giving you a ton of content to chew through. It does have a few shortcomings that are worth noting, however. Multiplayer matchmaking is restricted to private lobbies, so sessions are limited to playing with your Xbox Live friends. In addition, Halo 5: Forge suffers from a tight field of view that makes playing the game unexpectedly stressful. Still, if you are willing to overlook these and a few smaller issues, Halo 5: Forge is well worth downloading. After all, you can't beat free.

Halo: Reach
Halo: Reach 
$9.99

Halo: Reach—a part of the Halo: Master Chief Collection compilation that bundles every mainline Halo release, sans Halo 5—represents the first time the shooter has appeared on PC. Although the base game is as thrilling as the Xbox 360 original, this Master Chief Collection port suffers from changes and hiccups. Still, Halo: Reach fans should pick it up for the new 4K, 60 frames-per-second gunplay.

Halo: Spartan Strike
Halo: Spartan Strike 
$5.99

Is there anything that sounds more cynical than a top-down shooter Halo spin-off for phones and tablets? Ever since single-handedly saving the original Xbox, Halo has remained Microsoft's gaming cash cow, so sticking its name on something is a great way to drum up extra interest. However, instead of being a mere cash-in, Halo: Spartan Assault is a legitimately fun and well-produced game, triumphantly translating Master Chief's missions to PCs and mobile devices. Halo: Spartan Strike maintains much of that game's strengths, while cutting out most, but not all, of its weakness.

Overwatch
Overwatch 
$39.99

Shooters don't always need to be dark, gritty, or realistic. Cartoony fun has its place, too. Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch is a prime example of exactly that, with its colorful levels, multiple game modes that focus on teams attacking and defending, characters with vastly different play styles, and a few MOBA-like twists. Overwatch is a thoroughly enjoyable first-person shooter that's filled with mechanical variety, but it has one glaring problem—its awful micro-transaction structure.

Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2
Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 
$59.99

The original Garden Warfare married PopCap Games' zany Plants vs. Zombies universe with strategic, class-based third-person shooting, resulting in an addicting, polished multiplayer shooter. Garden Warfare 2 expands the roster of playable characters and variants, adds all-new customization options, introduces new game modes, and fleshes out the single-player experience, creating a much more rounded game than the original. That said, balance issues make some classes feel more potent than others, and the server connectivity is spotty at times, resulting in jittery matches. Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 is a solid title nonetheless, and one that fans of the original and newcomers alike can enjoy.

Prey
Prey 
$59.99

Let's get this out of the way: Prey could easily pass as an unofficial System Shock game. On the surface, Prey looks very much like the brainchild of industry veterans Ken Levine or Warren Spector. While the opinions of the latest System Shock spiritual installments (BioShock 2, BioShock Infinite) are all over the place, Bethesda's take does the Shock family and first-person shooter genre justice with its fast-paced, body-morphing gameplay set in Art Deco-flavored environments.

Star Wars: Battlefront
Star Wars: Battlefront 
$59.99

Star Wars: Battlefront is a multiplayer shooter that reboots the classic LucasArts video game series. Unlike previous games in the series, Star Wars: Battlefront lacks an overarching narrative and historic battles to reenact; it's basically a modern shooter given a liberal coat of Star Wars paint. The veneer is a fine one, and Battlefront has some good action to offer, including a playable Emperor Sheev Palpatine. However, once you look past the façade, the game doesn't have enough content or variety to keep you invested for a super-long time.

Star Wars Battlefront II
Star Wars Battlefront II 
$59.99

Star Wars Battlefront II does many things right. It has top-notch environments, thrilling multiplayer modes, and engaging mechanics that will have you piloting ships and swinging lightsabers deep into the night. That said, an uproar over this first-person shooter's included microtransactions tanked its reputation at launch, causing publisher Electronic Arts to quickly reverse course and temporarily remove all microtransactions from the game on the eve of its release. Microtransactions will strike back in some form, however, in the near future.

Superhot
Superhot 
$24.99

Superhot is the most innovative shooter to come along in some time. Despite its unimpressive visuals, this game is a genuinely creative and challenging experience that injects puzzle elements and a bizarre meta-narrative into quick, bite-sized servings of computerized violence. It might seem like a short and simple game at first, but between the addictive time-pausing mechanic and some very satisfying and repeatable extra modes, you'll quickly find yourself playing it for hours, and the built-in social media features for sharing your best runs will keep you coming back to get more consecutive, stylish kills.

Vanquish
Vanquish 
$19.99

"An act, process, or instance of changing place," is how Merriam-Webster defines motion. That meaning also perfectly summarizes the Platinum Games-developed Vanquish, a third-person shooter in which static play is a death sentence. Exquisitely designed with movement in mind, Vanquish's kinetic, jet-powered action adds visual flair and a wonderful sense of movement as you wreck mechs, vehicles, enemy troops, and super-powered bosses in a near-future setting. If Battlefield and Call of Duty have turned you off from shooters, Vanquish's unique take on the genre may be the title to make you strap on your in-game guns.

Best Sim & World-Building PC Games
Elite: Dangerous
Elite: Dangerous 
$44.99

If you want to appreciate the vastness of space, play Elite: Dangerous. This PC game by Frontier Developments is a crowdfunded follow-up to the classic Elite series of space sims. It's a game that gives you a ship, a handful of equipment, and a full tank of fuel, then sets you out on your own in the vast cosmos. It's huge, slow, deliberate, and open, and it will reward players with the patience stay with it. And if you need helping deciding where to fly, check out our favorite Microsoft Flight Simulator destinations.

Microsoft Flight Simulator
Microsoft Flight Simulator
$59.99

Microsoft Flight Simulator is one of PC gaming's most beloved series, a franchise cherished and supported by aviation enthusiasts. The 2020 edition, wonderfully crafted by developer Asobo Studio in tandem with Microsoft, is sure to bring a whole new generation and into the fanbase fold. Improved graphics aside, the near-magic addition of a fully recreated and explorable Earth, built and populated with Microsoft’s Bing satellite imagery and Azure cloud computing service, elevates the franchise to new heights.

Minecraft
Minecraft 
$26.95

Minecraft is a blocky, beautiful sandbox that lets you explore the depths of your imagination. The core of the game is exploring and surviving in a hostile world made from blocks that you can build with as you please. But as you play, you'll quickly see that this game has so much more to offer than just architecture. What Minecraft presents is plenty of space for players to enjoy their own kind of play. The detail-oriented will thrill at the possibilities of an enormous sandbox, but even a dabbler will find pleasure facing off against an unfriendly wilderness. If you've never experienced it, start exploring and see if you can resist the call of its endless potential.

No Man's Sky
No Man's Sky 
$59.99

The controversial and much-hyped No Man's Sky is a game that offers two opposing experiences. One is a beautiful and wholly fresh journey through space to chart undiscovered worlds. The other weighs down that joy with mundane and repetitive resource gathering and fighting. That said, No Man's Sky is so much more than a sterile description of its parts and features. It's an astounding artistic and technical achievement that's worth playing.

The Pinball Arcade
The Pinball Arcade 
Free to play one table; season packs start at $29.99

Pinball—the classic game of reflexes, luck, and spatial recognition—isn't nearly as popular as it was 25 years ago, but its legacy of tables, flippers, and gaudy lights lives on in FarSight Studios' The Pinball Arcade. Unlike Pinball FX 2, a pinball collection for PC gamers that features original tables from popular entertainment properties, The Pinball Arcade focuses on recreating classic real-world pinball machines from renowned manufacturers Bally, Gottlieb, Stern, and Williams. The result is a collection that looks, sounds, and feels like the pinball games of yore. Amassing all of your favorite tables could be a serious investment, however, because of the way game's season packs are organized.

Rocksmith 2014 Edition Remastered
Rocksmith 2014 Edition Remastered 
$39.99

In the mid- to late- aughts, Guitar Hero and its evolutionary spin off, Rock Band, gave people with zero musical talent the opportunity to realize their dreams by playing instrument-based karaoke with plastic axes. Now, they can learn to play the real deal with Ubisoft's Rocksmith 2014 Edition Remastered. The "game" teaches you the intricacies of learning bass, lead, and rhythm guitar via dynamic challenges, mini-games, and instructional videos. An enormous assortment of downloadable songs (which cost extra) ensures that your music library stays fresh.

Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth
Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth 
$39.99

Building on our inborn desire to see things no one has ever seen and take chances beyond the boundaries of reason—and, of course, exploit our hunger for addictive turn-based strategy games—Civilization: Beyond Earth catapults you off the planet that's housed your kings, wonders, and wars for millennia (or at least since 1991, when the original Civilization was released), and lets you fend for your life and begin a new history on a literally alien world. But if there's one problem with this game, it's that it never quite feels alien enough.

The Sims 3
The Sims 3 
$19.99

With The Sims 3, the Sims series has finally grown up. No longer are the Sims just digital action figures in a big dollhouse. The new Sims have personalities, goals, and unique body types and hairstyles. The Sims themselves aren't the only thing overhauled in this release, either. The game mechanics have been changed to make it easier to customize your environments and surroundings, giving users millions of ways to create the worlds of their choice.

Best Sports PC Games
Baseball Stars 2
Baseball Stars 2 
$9.99

There aren't many baseball games on PC, but Baseball Stars 2 stands out among the few that made it to the big leagues. The classic SNK sports title doesn't flaunt a MLB license or strive to be a super-realistic simulation. Instead, Baseball Stars 2 is old-school baseball fun, with simple controls, oodles of charm, and incredible cut scenes that highlight tense moments (like punching a pitcher in the face after he hurls a bean ball).

Fire Pro Wrestling World
Fire Pro Wrestling World 
$19.99

Fire Pro Wrestling World sees the series return to excellent form after the embarrassment that was the avatar-based, Xbox 360-exclusive Fire Pro Wrestling. World has all of the elements that comprise a great Fire Pro game—excellent creation tools, a ridiculously deep moveset, tight controls—and adds online play and Steam Workshop integration. Fire Pro Wrestling World is a slick package even in unfinished form (it's a Steam Early Access title), which should have Yuke's Co Ltd. and Visual Concept's WWE 2K18 shaking in its wrasslin' boots.

Football Manager 2018
Football Manager 2018 
$49.99

The Football Manager series is an enigma to many outside observers, but the seemingly niche appeal has grown into a borderline obsession for a large, passionate fan base. The football (or, yes, soccer) sim is an insanely detailed, text-heavy simulation of the world's most popular sport, wherein you take on the role of club manager overseeing player transfers, on-field tactics, staff instructions, and everything in between in a bid to lead your club to glory. Part tactics sim, part strategy game, part financial manager, and part talent scout, Football Manager 2018 is capable of eliciting a wide range of emotions, and it has a surprisingly strong capacity for creating emergent narratives.

Mutant Football League
Mutant Football League 
$24.99

Football is a bad sport. Yes, it's beloved by millions, but the concussions that result from giants hurling themselves at each other are an undeniable problem. The sport is much more enjoyable in video game form, especially arcade-style football, which lets you perform superhuman feats without annoying flags or hideous injuries. Digital Dream Entertainment's Mutant Football League literally plays by that ruleset by pitting skeletons, robots, orcs, aliens, and mutated humans against each other in not-so-friendly gridiron contests featuring landmines and cheat plays. Mutant Football League is definitely worth playing, and not because it's the rare American football PC game; it's legitimately good, despite some annoying dirty tricks. 

Rocket League
Rocket League 
$19.99

There are few video games that drop all dark and portentous pretenses and give you a straightforward, honest-to-goodness game. Rocket League is one such title. It blends the charm of RC racing with the heated competition of soccer, and adds plenty of over-the-top spectacle to keep every match interesting. Rocket League is just as fun during your first hour as it is during your twentieth; there are very few multiplayer games that utilize addictive simplicity as effectively. It even supports cross-platform play with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One gamers.

Super Mega Baseball 2
Super Mega Baseball 2 
$29.99

Long gone are the days when the likes of Midway's NFL Blitz and Nintendo's Ken Griffey Jr. games ruled the market with their pick-up-and-play sensibility, flashy graphics, and outrageous gameplay. Hardcore simulations like FIFA or NBA 2K are great, but arcade sports fans have lamented the decline of the less realistic stuff. If you're in that camp, pick up Super Mega Baseball 2. The game offers accessible mechanics, a cartoony art style, and an overall sense of fun that's rare in today's sports games. However, it has enough depth to keep even the most die-hard baseball fans addicted. Super Mega Baseball 2 has a couple of graphics-related flaws, but it's one of the best current-gen sports games available for PC.

Super Mega Baseball 3
Super Mega Baseball 3
$44.99

Super Mega Baseball 3 contains new on-field improvements, player traits, front office happenings, and gameplay modes for both default and custom ball clubs that push the series deeper into simulation territory. The new Pennant Race mode delivers cross-platform play with console ballplayers, too. Despite light frame rate issues and other minor complaints, Super Mega Baseball 3 is the best title in the series to date.

Tony Hawk Pro Skater
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2
$39.99

The odd thing about aging is just how often it makes you look to the past, perhaps as a way to cope with an ever-shrinking future. The resulting nostalgia can sometimes soften the rough edges on the things we love, making them seem better than they truly were when we first experienced them. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2—a bundle that remasters two iconic late-1990s and early-2000s skateboarding games—doesn't fall into that trap. In fact, it proves that, yes, those brash and exciting action-sports titles are as good as our memories recall, but they now exist with a beautiful visual overhaul and new, bountiful options that makes them even better than what we remember.

Best Stealth PC Games
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided 
$59.99

Cyborg law enforcer Adam Jensen returns to stealth-based shooting action in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the newest entry in Square Enix's cyberpunk series. Mankind Divided is a dark journey through an oppressive world where the "augmented" live as second-class citizens. Though Deus Ex's is light on its usual conspiracy-laced story, the game's numerous side quests, fantastic stealth, and gritty futuristic setting will keep you hiding, shooting, and hacking for a long time to come.

Dishonored
Dishonored 
$19.99

Arkane Studios' Dishonored is a fantastic first-person game that puts you in a playground of murder and stealth, while still keeping focused on an interesting story in a rich and enthralling fantasy world that's filled with supernatural happenings. It's not quite as large, as open, or as well-written as Deus Ex, but it stands as a solid spiritual successor to one of the best PC games of all time.

Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes
Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes 
$19.99

Stealth-action series Metal Gear started life on the MSX home computer and at long last returns to the PC after an extended absence. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes sees series protagonist Big Boss undertake extraction and elimination missions against the mysterious Cipher organization in this Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain prologue. Boasting beautiful graphics that were built on the impressive FOX Engine, a wide selection of weapons, and a variety of ways to tackle missions, Ground Zeroes sets the stage for the final chapter in the series, even if it can be beaten in roughly an hour.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain 
$39.99

In terms of pure gameplay, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the best game in the long-running stealth series. You once again play as Big Boss, aka Punished "Venom" Snake, who battles the nefarious XOF organization across 1980s Africa and Afghanistan. Boasting a wealth of combat options, impressive weaponry, and outstanding audio and video work, The Phantom Pain is an absolute joy to play. That said, the truncated story raises more questions than it answers, and may leave you feeling a phantom pain of your own.

Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine
Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine 
$14.99

In this production by Pocketwatch Games, a ragtag group of criminals escape from the French Riviera prison and go on several heists: for money, documents, and, eventually, the chance to retire from the business once and for all. Monaco has the co-op formula down pat; it's easy to jump in, and complex enough to reel in long hours of sneaking and thieving. With plenty of charm and a novel design that makes stealth work, Monaco is one of the best PC co-op experiences.

Best Strategy PC Games
Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock
Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock 
$39.99

The Battlestar Galactica property has enamored two generations of sci-fi enthusiasts, with both the original 1978 series and the 2007 reboot achieving cult classic status. Deadlock sets itself on ground left relatively untouched by either series, taking players into the throes of the first Cylon war. The turn-based strategy game puts you in command of the entire colonial fleet and the disposition of its forces. Though some tactical elements occasionally feel unbalanced, Deadlock does justice to the franchise by delivering incredible space battles and intriguing lore.

Battletech
Battletech 
$39.99

Battletech is a pure adaptation of the classic board game that was first published in 1984 by FASA Corporation. Jordan Weisman, one of the board game's creators, played an executive role in this modern take. As a result, the PC game's universe is rich and storied, with the setting echoing a strangely effective combination of giant robots and medieval feudalism. In Battletech, noble houses project their battlefield influences using Battlemechs, or 'Mechs, piloted by knights or sellswords called Mechwarriors. This means lots of action as you position units, launch attacks, and try to outsmart your opponent. That said, Battletech has a level of randomness that feels unfair at times.

Gears Tactics
Gears Tactics
$59.99

Mainline Gears of War games are cover-based shooters that put you in the boots of muscled soldiers who defend humanity from the mutant horde called the Locust. Miraculously, Gears Tactics—the franchise's first venture into the turn-based, strategy genre—preserves many series hallmarks, including wild melee executions, cover-heavy environments, and waves of overaggressive enemies. Cheap enemy spawning leads to frustrating moments, though.

Halo Wars 2
Halo Wars 2 
$59.99

Halo Wars 2 is a real-time strategy game set within Microsoft's insanely popular Halo universe. Utilizing a rock-paper-scissors-styled combat system, Halo Wars 2 tasks you with developing bases and armies to combat hostile alien forces. The game keeps things simple: Once you familiarize yourself with your units and resource production, it's just a matter of building the right troops for the job at hand, whether that means capturing enemy bases, defending your own base, or surviving waves of enemies. Halo Wars 2's simple design makes the RTS experience accessible for both newcomers and veterans, but the game doesn't do much to invigorate the genre besides adding the e-sports-friendly Blitz mode.

StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void
StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void 
$39.99

The third and final StarCraft II expansion is both a fantastic conclusion to Blizzard's five-year saga and a great entry point into one of the most complex, but satisfying, strategy games ever made. Unlike the previous StarCraft II expansion, Legacy of the Void doesn't require you to buy any previous versions of the game to play this package. It's completely standalone. Factor in a varied single-player campaign, gorgeous cinematics, and new noob-friendly co-op modes, and you'll see that Legacy of the Void is one of the best PC games of all time.

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty
StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty 
$19.99

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is a sci-fi real-time strategy game in which you build structures and gather resources to build an army and defeat your opponent through cunning tactics and sheer firepower. Nothing could quite live up to the hype surrounding the real-time strategy game's release, but, even so, this is a wonderful title. The story is well-paced, and the strategy and resource-management missions will lock you into finishing the game.

Supreme Commander 2
Supreme Commander 2 
$12.99

Gas Powered Games' Supreme Commander 2 probably doesn't deserve the word "supreme" in its title, but then changing the title would defeat the purpose of making a sequel. Not that this game isn't a fine follow-up to the 2007 original, but it's definitely aimed at a broader (and less patient) audience. With much of the micromanagement minutiae reduced or removed entirely, Supreme Commander 2 is more of a garden-variety real-time strategy title than a proud member of a distinctive series. Still, it's a lot of fun if you can accept the gameplay changes.

Treachery in Beatdown City
Treachery in Beatdown City 
$19.99

On the surface, Treachery in Beatdown City appears to be a strict homage to classic beat ‘em up games from the 1980s and 1990s. However, the brawler's menu-driven, tactical combo system and biting urban satire reveals a game that's radically different than what's come before it. Developed by Nuchallenger, Treachery in Beatdown City is a fun indie game that requires you to use your brain to battle the way through the gentrification elements that plagues a fictional city's streets, but its pace may prove too slow for traditional beat 'em up fans. Tactics fans, on the other hand, may dig it.  

XCOM Chimera Squad
XCOM: Chimera Squad
$19.99

The XCOM games aren’t for the impatient or faint of heart. The brutal, turn-based strategy relies heavily on random chance, permanent unit death, and an overarching campaign that takes many hours of careful resource management. Unfortunately, casual strategy fans find the experience daunting. 

XCOM: Chimera Squad, on the other hand, is a friendlier, more accessible XCOM game. This spin-off keeps the setting and general feel of the XCOM series, but reduces the stakes by offering a single city to protect, a modest squad of diverse (and pre-created) units, and a more forgiving combat. XCOM: Chimera Squad lacks the general brutality of the mainline series, but it still scratches that strategy itch.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown
XCOM: Enemy Unknown 
$29.99

2K Games and Firaxis succeeded in rekindling a long-dead franchise with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. This turn-based strategy game is a reimagining of 1994's X-COM: UFO Defense, a long-beloved game that last saw a sequel in 2001 with the ill-received X-COM: Enforcer, a shooter that didn't have any of the first game's strategy. XCOM: Enemy Unknown feels like a straight remake of the original, bringing almost everything gamers loved about it to the PC, along with updated graphics, streamlined gameplay, and plenty of challenge
