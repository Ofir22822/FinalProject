Stardew Valley best Android gamepad support games


The market for games with controller support is growing. Android TV, the Nvidia Shield Console, and other systems are putting games with gamepad support on the forefront and making them more popular. The proliferation of gamepads and Bluetooth controllers have made playing games on your mobile devices with a controller easier than ever before. Why not play some wicked good games with it? Here are the best games with gamepad support for Android. Please note that there are some older games with excellent controller support like Star Wars: KOTOR and The Bard’s Tale. However, many of those older controller games haven’t been updated in years and we can’t guarantee that they’ll work with newer controllers, newer versions of Android, or newer devices. You can try those at your own risk.

Bridge Constructor Portal
Price: Free / $4.99

Bridge Constructor Portal is a crossover game between the popular Bridge Constructor series and the Portal PC franchise. The mechanics are mostly Bridge Constructor. You build bridges with various materials to get from one end of the level to the other. There are portals to make things easier (or harder) as well as cameos from popular characters like GLaDOS. It’s a delightful puzzle game experience and one of the few with controller support. You also get Google Play Games achievements and support for tablets. The game runs for $4.99 with no in-app purchases or ads. We like this one a lot and it’s free if you use Google Play Pass.

Crossy Road
Price: Free to play

Crossy Road is one of the most popular mobile games ever. It also has MFi controller support. This is basically the mobile gaming version of Frogger. You move the chicken forward across roads, streams, and other obstacles while avoiding being run over by cars or falling in the water. It’s a simple game with fun graphics and easy controls. It’s also safe for older kids. This is a free to play game, but the in-app purchases are mostly for extra characters. This is a good one and it supports Android TV as well.

Endurance
Price: Free / $3.49

Endurance is one of the newer games with gamepad support. It’s a retro style action shooter with roguelike and dungeon crawler mechanics. Players head to Endurance, a ship where a virus spread and caused people to go insane. It’s technically a prequel to the developer’s other game, Ailment, but you can play it on its own if you want to. The game features tons of weapons, plenty of action, and a pretty decent little story. The game can stutter on older, midrange, or lower end devices and the free version has some long ads. However, you can easily buy the premium version to remove ads and the rest is tolerable. This is a pretty decent game and so is Ailment.

Evoland 2
Price: $7.99

Evoland is one of the most unique game franchises on mobile. It doesn’t use any one particular style or genre. Evoland 2, the latest game in the series, employs platformer, fighter, top-down shooter, trading card, and RPG mechanics. The game also changes its graphics up quite a bit to match the style of game play. That makes it one of the most unique experiences on mobile. The developers boast support for most types of Bluetooth controllers as well as Nvidia Shield support. The first Evoland is also quite good and supports hardware controllers as well. The publisher, Playdigious, also has Dead Cells, another excellent game with gamepad support that was launched in 2020.

GRID Autosport
Price: $9.99

GRID Autosport is one of the newest games with gamepad support. It’s also one of the best racer’s we’ve seen in a while. In short, this is a port of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 racing game along with all of its DLC under one roof. There are over 100 cars, over 100 circuits to race, scalable difficulty, and a variety of race types. It also supports offline game play if you want to go that route. Frankly, this game has a ton of upside and not that much downside. Most of the complaints are for the on-screen controls, but that’s not why you’re here so it doesn’t matter all that much. The game runs for $9.99 with no in-app purchases.

Levelhead is one of those special games that only comes out every few years. It’s a platformer with outstanding execution, good mechanics, and a level builder for extra depth.

Even when it launched it had virtually no bugs or issues that we could find. This one of those legendary mobile games that should be way more popular than it really is.

Minecraft
Price: $6.99 with in-app purchases

Minecraft is one of the most popular games out there. It drops you into randomly generated worlds with plenty of stuff to do. You can build, you can mine, you can farm, and there is even a final boss to kill. Updates in 2017 aligned the game with its console and PC counterparts. That means you can start a world in one game and then play it on another system entirely. This is one of the few games with that level of cross-play support. It’s $6.99 for the game. The in-app purchases are optional aesthetic things like character skins.

Riptide GP series
Price: $0.99-$2.99

Vector Unit has some real winners with the Riptide series. They are a trio of racing games that take place on jet skis. Your goal will be to race them, perform stunts, and make it to the end. The stunts give you boost. Thus, the better stunts you do, the faster you can go as long as you actually use the boost you get. The games get progressively more complex and better as they go. The first one is the weakest of the three. The third one is the strongest. Thankfully, they’re all fairly inexpensive. The second has in-app purchases but you totally don’t need them to enjoy the game. All three games have gamepad support.

Price: $7.99

Stardew Valley is one of the newer games with controller support. It’s a farming simulator with RPG elements. You create a farm, raise your crops, and live a life. The game has your usual farming game staples like gathering and selling crops and animals of various types. However, this one adds additional elements like being social with the nearby townspeople and even things like seasonal events and weddings. It’s a deep game with a long play time and that helps justify its $7.99 price tag. This is easily one of the best games of 2019 and it has controller support!

Steam Link
Price: Free

Steam Link isn’t a game. However, it lets you play games. It connects your phone to your computer. The app then streams your PC games to your phone, Android TV device, tablet, etc with full controller support. This lets you play PC games from the comfort of your living room (for Android TV devices) or anywhere in your house (for mobile devices). This is a beta app and it has plenty of bugs to flush out. However, PC gaming with a controller on a mobile device is basically the dream and this is as close to it as you can get right now.

Stickman Skate Battle
Price: Free to play

Stickman Skate Battle is another decent sports game with controller support. This one is more of an arcade game compared to the more complete experience of Skateboard Party 3. You go head to head in various game modes to score the most points or do the best tricks. Additionally, it has a practice mode, daily and weekly tournaments, and it works in offline mode. Plus, it has Android TV and Nvidia Shield support as well. It’s a good, family friendly arcade skateboard game. It is a free to play game, though, but it’s not the worst free to play experience we’ve had.

Bonus: Some Gameloft games
Price: Varies

Gameloft has a bunch of games and many of them have controller support. That includes updates games like Asphalt 8: Airborne, Asphalt Xtreme, Order & Chaos 2, and Modern Combat 5: Blackout. That’s a good mixture of racing games, MMORPGs, and first person shooters. The controller support is above average compared to most games and that’s one of the better aspects to Gameloft’s titles. They are all free to play games and the free to play strategy could be better. However, they are current, accessible, and they have game pad support for a variety of controllers. Gameloft also has a list of games with controller support. We linked it at the button if you want to see their other options.

Bonus: Nvidia Shield games with controller support
Price: Varies

Nvidia worked hard to bring a lot of games to the forefront. Unfortunately, all of them are for Android TV. However, that means they all have gamepad support without exception. Those looking for controller games on Android should definitely check out Nvidia’s hardware first. There are some really good games in their lineup. That includes Portal, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Resident Evil 5, and many more newer games. The only downside is that these games only work with Nvidia Shield hardware, such as the Nvidia Shield TV. Other than that, these games are all console quality in terms of graphics, content, and controller support.
