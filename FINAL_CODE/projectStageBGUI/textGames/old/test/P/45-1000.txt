Nonetheless, there’s still a wide variety of incredible titles for Xbox Game Pass on PC. From platformers and shooters to RPGs and card games, here are the best titles on Xbox Game Pass for PC.

The Outer Worlds
The Outer Worlds
Fans of the Fallout series, rejoice! Obsidian’s popular sci-fi shooter — one that’s heavily inspired by Bethesda’s wasteland — is available for PC players who subscribe to Game Pass. The Outer Worlds throws you into a player-driven story where your actions have consequences, and the right choice isn’t always what it seems. Along the way, you’ll meet a colorful cast of characters, engage in hilarious dialogue, and accrue an arsenal of ridiculously powerful weapons. If you happened to miss out on The Outer Worlds last year, now is the perfect time to check it out.

Streets of Rage 4

The legendary brawler returned in 2020, keeping its trademark side-scrolling action from decades ago but bringing a new, vivid art style. The action takes place several years after Streets of Rage 3, and a new criminal empire has emerged. It’s up to you — and maybe even a few friends — to stop the Y Twins from taking over the city. Multiple difficulties, various co-op modes, and a high score board keep things interesting well beyond the final credits.

Gears 5

What else needs to be said? It’s Gears 5 — the latest entry in the storied Gears franchise. You’ll be chain-sawing hordes of Locust, ducking from cover to cover, and duking it out with other players in a tense online multiplayer mode.

This time around, you’ll follow Kait Diaz. As war is breaking out all around her, she’ll step out on her own to discover more about herself and her connection to the enemy, and she’ll face some difficult choices along the way.

Celeste

Celeste
A narrative-driven, brutally difficult platformer, Celeste follows the story of Madeline as she treks to the top of Celeste Mountain. During your journey, you’ll unravel an emotional story about mental health, overcoming adversity, and being true to yourself. It’s a surprising tale and one that will stick with you well beyond the final credits.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition

One of the best strategy games ever made is back — and more definitive than ever. Now playable in 4K, AoE II: Definitive Edition brings a remastered soundtrack, four new civilizations, and three new campaigns.


Since its release, the game has seen multiple updates, and more are planned for the future. In fact, as part of the November Update, Age of Empires II will be getting a wild new battle royale mode. If you’re an old fan of the franchise, it’s definitely worth a look.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection

Halo Infinite may have been delayed, but you can still run around as Master Chief with this collection of past hits. Six games will be part of the collection, but right now, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 3: ODST are some of the playable titles.


All the games have been reworked to run in 4K and up to 60 frames per second, and many of them offer customizable controls and settings. There’s also a robust multiplayer mode that — when done being updated — will give you access to over 120 iconic maps.

Battle Chasers: Nightwar

Its name leaves much to be desired, but the game itself is a wonderful blend of traditional JPRG elements and western conveniences. You’ll navigate a massive overworld map, take on a lengthy list of main missions and side quests, and then dive into dungeons for some tense, turn-based battles.


The story follows Gully, a young girl who is hoping to find her missing father. While out on an expedition, her airship is shot down over an unknown land, and she’ll need the help of her ragtag party to make it out safely and track down her father.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
If you’re looking for a deep Metroidvania experience, look no further than Bloodstained. You’ll battle your way through an ancient castle haunted by demons, monsters, and other horrifying creatures hellbent on stopping you on your quest to save humanity.


The game is challenging — like any good Metroidvania — but also boasts one of the most unique art styles in recent memory, with cel-shaped, 2.5D characters and environments gracing your screen. It certainly looks better now than it did on Switch, and it’s among the best games available on Xbox Game Pass for PC.

Fallout 76
Fallout 76 Streaming Xbox Game Pass Android
Although it had a rough start, Fallout 76 is finally the game it was meant to be. Numerous patches have added new questlines, powerful new weapons, and — most importantly — NPCs. At launch, Fallout 76 was only populated by other real players, turning its wasteland into a place that simply wasn’t true to the Fallout name. Now, it’s much more reminiscent of past titles and is certainly a post-apocalyptic adventure worth taking.

Slay the Spire

A wild mash between card game and roguelike, Slay the Spire was one of the best games released in 2017. If you happened to miss out on it, now’s the perfect chance to sit down and put together a Spire-slaying hand of cards. Its simple design makes it easy to pick up and play, but fighting your way through the increasingly difficult levels isn’t for the faint of heart.
