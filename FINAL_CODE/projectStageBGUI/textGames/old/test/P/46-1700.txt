The best video games based on movies
By Jacob Roach
November 23, 2020
In the past, video games based on movies have generally been bad. Superman 64 and Aliens: Colonial Marines are two prime examples, but there are countless others. Thankfully, developers have taken a different direction in recent years. Rather than simply releasing a game as a marketing tactic for an upcoming movie, developers are creating separate experiences set in the world of a film but with a unique story to tell. In this guide, we’ve rounded up the best video games based on movies.

Alien: Isolation

Alien: Isolation - PlayStation 4

$84 FROM AMAZON
$95 FROM WALMART
Alien: Isolation is a bona fide survival horror game. Instead of throwing you into an arena with some guns and a whole lot of Xenomorphs, Isolation focuses on, well, isolation. You play as Ripley’s daughter 15 years after the events of the first Alien film. After discovering that a flight recorder documenting Ripley’s fate is hidden on a Seegson Corporation ship, you’re sent to find it.

Just like Alien, your goal isn’t to go in guns blazing. Encounters with a Xenomorph will be brief and filled with anxiety, as you attempt to outrun the beast. Most of Alien: Isolation is focused on sneaking around tight corridors and using various tools to deter the creature, not defeat it, perfectly capturing the spirit of the source material.

Marvel’s Avengers

$27 FROM AMAZON

Although Marvel’s Avengers is very loudly not based on Marvel’s multi-billion-dollar film franchise, it certainly borrows a lot. Plus Kamala Khan, you have access to the same roster of Avengers: Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Captain America. Although Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics got a lot of flak for the games-as-a-service elements, Marvel’s Avengers remains a thoroughly enjoyable action game with a firecracker single-player campaign.

The “live” part of the game isn’t bad, either. Like Destiny 2 and similar titles, Avengers is repetitive. After the 15 to 20 hours of the campaign, you’ll be spending your time assembling your own version of the Avengers, taking on baddies in a range of familiar locations. Piloting the heroes feels good, so Marvel’s Avengers keeps things interesting from moment to moment. However, its staying power comes from the leveling system. Each hero has their own tree of skills and unlocking all of them will keep you hooked for dozens of hours after the campaign.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
$49 FROM AMAZON
$28 FROM CDKEYS.COM
$51 FROM WALMART
There are a handful of good Star Wars games, but a lot more bad ones. Thankfully, Fallen Order fits in the former category. The game takes place between Episode III and Episode IV, or more accurately, between Episode III and the events of Star Wars Rebels. You play as Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan under the oppressive threat of the Great Jedi Purge.

In a shift from most other Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order puts you in the shoes of an actual Jedi, fit with a customizable lightsaber and force powers. Throughout your adventure, you’ll travel to multiple planets, each fit with secrets, alternative paths, and optional boss battles.

Jurassic World Evolution

$43 FROM AMAZON

$28 FROM GAMESTOP
Jurassic World Evolution is about the furthest thing you’d expect out of a Jurassic Park-inspired game. It’s a simulation game created by Frontier Developments, the same studio behind Planet Coaster and the recently released Planet Zoo. In the game, you run a dinosaur park spread across five islands.

Thankfully, it’s not just a reskin of Planet Coaster. Evolution features voice acting from Jeff Goldblum, Bryce Dallas Howard, and B. D. Wong, and also focuses on three distinct skill trees: Science, Entertainment, and Security. Although dinosaur theme park simulation is an unlikely genre, it works well for Jurassic World: Evolution due to the fact that the game was developed by a master of the simulation genre.

Middle-earth: Shadow of War

$9 FROM AMAZON

Like Star Wars, there are a lot of Lord of the Rings games, most of which aren’t very good. The two Middle-earth games, Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War, don’t fit into that category, though. In both games, you play as Talion, a ranger whose spirit is infused with the elf lord Celebrimbor. Unsurprisingly, your goal is simply to stop Sauron.

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a prequel to the movies, and although the lore is interesting for LOTR fans, we’re including Shadow of War based on its mechanics. In the game, you’ll need to confront Sauron’s orc army. As you take out ranking members, others will step in to take their place, becoming more powerful in the process. No two playthroughs are exactly the same, as the enemies you make throughout your playthrough will be determined by who’s highest on your hit list.

GoldenEye 007

GoldenEye 007 is the one exception to the “no movie tie-in” rule. Released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64, GoldenEye set in motion an era of split-screen shooting, as players bounced bullets off each other in a deathmatch arena. Nowadays, GoldenEye doesn’t feel quite as good as it did back in 1997. Still, its impact on gaming is undeniable.

That doesn’t mean you should boot it back up, though. The Nintendo 64 isn’t the best platform for shooters, with its limited graphical fidelity and asinine controller design. Thankfully, a redesign of GoldenEye 007 built on the Source engine is available to download on PC for free.

John Wick Hex

$20 FROM EPIC GAMES STORE
John Wick Hex is a much more methodical experience than its source material. It’s a timeline strategy game where time stops so you can plan your next action. You’ll choose where you want to move and what actions you want to take, and once you do, time will resume. It turns out that you can’t be as badass as John Wick in real time, even in a video game.

That aside, John Wick Hex still makes you feel like the Baba Yaga, with expertly crafted animations and neon-plastered scenery. Although a AAA studio could likely make a more visceral John Wick experience, Hex is still a solid, smaller title that offers a unique take on the six-year-old franchise. It’s available now on PC and PS4, but it’s coming to Switch and Xbox One later this year, too.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

$90 FROM AMAZON

At the time, pairing a multi-billion-dollar franchise like Star Wars with the developer of Neverwinter Nights and the Baldur’s Gate games seemed like it wouldn’t work. BioWare quickly proved that wasn’t the case, though. Knight of the Old Republic almost single-handedly proved that video games based on movies could offer depth and complexity.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic takes place in, well, the Old Republic, 4,000 years before the Galactic Empire rose to power. You play as a Jedi on a multi-planet quest to overthrow Darth Malak. Like the BioWare titles that came before Knights of the Old Republic, combat takes place over a series of rounds, with combat actions using the d20 system to determine if the action was successful or not.

Mad Max

Mad Max - PS4
$27 FROM AMAZON
Mad Max isn’t based on any particular film from the series, though it released shortly after Fury Road hit theaters. It’s an open world action-adventure game in the vein of Assassin’s Creed and Batman: Arkham Asylum. You play as Max Rockatansky, a former highway patrol officer in search of fuel for his Interceptor.

Although Mad Max isn’t on the level as Arkham Asylum and the better Assassin’s Creed games, it’s still a decent experience. A core focus of the title is vehicular combat. As you make your way around the wasteland, you can find new items to outfit your vehicle, making it stronger, faster, and more deadly.

Friday the 13th: The Game

Friday the 13th: The Game
$23 FROM AMAZON
$22 FROM WALMART

Friday the 13th: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer title with similar gameplay to Dead by Daylight. The eight-player online matches feature seven Camp Crystal Lake Counselors facing off against a menacing Jason Voorhees. Counselors win if they escape the map alive or survive until time runs out. Of course, the goal of the Jason player is to kill as many counselors as possible.

Friday the 13th: The Game features a simple premise, one that could quickly become stale. Thankfully, the Camp Crystal Lake map is large and open, with multiple side quests for counselors to complete. Completing these quests will give the counselors a better chance of survival, either by aiding in an escape route or helping slow down Jason.

Blair Witch

Blair Witch - PC
$30 FROM STEAM
Blair Witch emerged without fanfare; both announced and released in 2019 without further ado. Your character is Ellis Lynch, a military veteran and former police officer, who has decided to join a search party for a child gone missing deep in Burkittsville, Maryland’s Black Hills Forest. Essential to the game’s outcome is your dog, Bullet, who accompanies you.

Blair Witch is primarily concerned with exploration—combing through the woods and solving additional puzzles that come up. But Bullet is by far the most intriguing aspect of the game. Along with following scents and helping you secure items, the dog also determines your physiological well-being.

It’s critical to keep Bullet close to you if you are to avoid suffering a horrific fate.
