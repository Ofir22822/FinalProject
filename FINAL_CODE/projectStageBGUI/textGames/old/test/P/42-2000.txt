Kotaku Australia’s Best Games Of 2020

It’s safe to say 2020 hasn’t been a normal year. From raging bushfires to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, there’s been plenty of challenges to overcome. These changes have been met head on by the video games industry, which has continued to thrive in 2020. In a year with so much hardship game releases have continued, giving everyone a much needed break from reality.

Final Fantasy VII Remake made waves when it launched in March and Animal Crossing: New Horizons follow suit a few weeks later, bringing everyone the joy they were missing at the start of the year. We also had the incredible Ori and the Will of the Wisps in March, the gorgeous Ghost of Tsushima in July and the impressive rise of Fall Guys in August.

With so many incredible games already released this year, it’s difficult to narrow down our favourites — but read on to see which games made the final cut.

Kotaku Australia’s 2020 GOTY List
Yakuza: Like A Dragon

If you’ve ever wanted to play a game “just for fun”, then the Yakuza series is exactly what you want. Filled to the brim with ridiculous moments, Like A Dragon ups the ante with some surprisingly effective turn-based combat and a new protagonist that truly fits the franchise.

Plus, what other next-gen game will let you summon a hen that shoots out an egg at light speed just to heal your party? Only Yakuza will.

Demon’s Souls

An absolute triumph, and a crowning achievement for the continued excellence of Sony’s in-house masters of remasters, Bluepoint Games.

[The] Demon’s Souls remake stands out as an incredibly fun way to revisit the cursed land of Boletaria. It’s creepy. It’s gloomy. You’ll get invaded by laggy arseholes near the end of a long level and have to do the whole thing over again. It feels like coming home.

Spider-Man: Miles Morales

An excellent continuation of the Spider-Man saga, with an arguably more empathetic and engaging character. Miles’ journey to save Harlem and his city is an excellent opening for the PS5, and a great technical benchmark for future titles.

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2
Lead
It’s a damaged Polaroid photo scanned, digitised, and lovingly retouched. It’s gravel picked out of a scraped knee. It’s a good night’s rest, untouched by nightmares and insomnia. It is, as it always was, exactly what I need right now.

Among Us

Among Us first launched in 2018, but its discovery by international streamers helped launch the deceptive party game into one of 2020’s most enormous hits. “That helped us get popularity there, and then sometime in the middle of 2019, [a YouTuber] in Brazil played it, and their fanbase picked it up, and it’s just been kind of slowing growing from there,” one of the developers told Kotaku.

You can download Among Us for free on Android or iOS through your phone's app stores, or buy the game on PC through Steam. 

 

Hades

Rather, developer Supergiant’s Greek mythology-flavored action roguelike is, improbably, the game that best characterises the year 2020.
Supergiant know how to make video games, and it's not a stretch to say that Hades might be the pinnacle of the studio's already excellent track record. "It’s an excellent roguelite, with an amazing story and addictive gameplay. But there’s another big reason why Hades is seeing such a massively positive response: Everyone is so friggin’ hot," Ash wrote.

You can buy Hades through the Epic Games Store or Steam,where it has a 98 per cent user rating from almost 45,000 reviews. Not bad, Supergiant.

Paper Mario: The Origami King

What do Red Koopa Troopas think about as they’re shuffling back and forth all day on top of platforms? Where do Shy Guys go on their days off? Paper Mario is the only series brave enough to answer these burning questions about the inner lives of Mario characters, and it answers them with humour, style, and more truly human moments than you can find in most of Nintendo’s fantasy worlds.
Seriously, you won't find an RPG like Paper Mario anywhere else. You can buy the digital version through the eShop or the (cheaper) physical copy here.

Star Wars: Squadrons

As a Star Wars experience though it’s incredible, and that’s what’s more important here. I’ve had people over to my house just to sit down and play the game, which is something I can’t remember happening since I got a Switch at launch.
I'm still waiting for some crucial patches to fix up parts of the PC experience, but even if you skip the multiplayer and just enjoy the campaign alone, Star Wars Squadrons is one hell of a game. And, if we're being honest, the kind of Star Wars game everyone has been screaming at EA to make since they got the license.

You can buy Star Wars Squadrons HERE for consoles, and here on Steam.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Animal Crossing: New Horizons presents an ideal world, where chores are as fun as fishing and crafting. A world where your friends are just moments away, and everything in life is pure and wholesome. In contrast, our own world is rather frightening right now. Animal Crossing is the perfect escape for these strange times.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake

It’s a lot of the little things brought to life in slightly different ways. The moment you discover Aerith’s house for the first time and the world lighting kicks in a second late, revealing a wonderful forest shrine encapsulated by flowers, herbs, hills and scrap surrounded by a waterfall. The sound kicks in with the sound of Aerith’s words, and the whole scene has so much more heart than Square could have envisioned back in the ‘90s.

Fall Guys

Whether you win or lose, Fall Guys is simple, honest fun. Every bean is just adorable and the courses are all extremely colourful. It’s whimsical, bright and totally charming. There’s a sense of effortless fun here, making it easy to fall in love with the game. There’s also a heap of variety, meaning even after hours of playing the game it’s unlikely you’ll end up on the same course too often.

Crusader Kings 3

Crusader Kings III may begin in what we used to call the Dark Ages, but it’s a Renaissance for strategy gaming in 2020.
Paradox games are always incredible in scope -- but for maybe the first time, they've also backed up with some serious UI improvements. A huge recommended game to anyone who enjoys visual novels, Bioware games, system simulators, you name it -- you'll find something in Crusader Kings 3 to your taste.

Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time

[Crash Bandicoot 4] is the original Crash Bandicoot trilogy on acid. Where before there were linear pathways, easily understood challenges and boxes hiding just in the corner of your vision there’s now big open worlds, multiple pathways, boxes hiding in places you’d never look and extremely well-hidden paths you can run past multiple times without spotting.

Golf With Your Friends
best games 2020 golf with your friends
Blacklight Interactive’s Golf With Your Friends proved to be a very popular title back in May, reaching Steam's top steam releases when it launched. There's a good reason — Golf With Your Friends is wacky good fun, and great to play with friends. There's a range of wild courses to choose from and each one has its own unique secrets to discover. Whether you're good at the game or not doesn't matter. It's so fun you'll have a good time anyway.

It's always nice to see Aussie games succeed and Golf With Yout Friends certainly deserves its place among the best games of 2020.

Microsoft Flight Simulator

Flight simulators have been around for decades — Microsoft Flight Simulator itself goes back to the late ’80s — but they have always existed as niche, independent products lacking the support, scale or budget that a major platform holder could provide. What Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 has in spades is that support and scalability. It is that rare breed of live service game that makes perfect sense.

Command & Conquer Remastered Collection

Command & Conquer: The Remastered Collection has that all-too rare quality. Precisely everything EA and Petroglyph promised they’d do, the remaster delivers. It’s the original Command & Conquer, along with Red Alert and all the expansions for both games. You can play in the original blocky sprites, or switch to crisp high-def with a tap of the space bar.

Desperadoes 3

Turning Desperados 3 into an origin story is a genius move, because the last Desperados game is almost 15 years old. But if you’ve played any stealth tactics games, Desperados 3 will sink in immediately.

Valorant

For now, as an ancient CS player and the kind of target audience for a game like this, I’m having a blast. So is much of my friends list, and some older folks I haven’t played with in decades have even popped up again out of the woodwork. That’s always a good sign. Everyone, to some degree or another, is having fun. And for a video game, that’s all you can ask.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps
2020 video games
It’s rare that a game makes me stop and go, ‘ooh,’ but the opening moments of Ori and the Will of the Wisps did just that. It’s genuinely beautiful, and there’ve been so many moments that have left me in awe.

The Last of Us Part 2

It’s easy to hold up The Last of Us 2 as a showcase of blockbuster gaming. It is, on the surface, a shining example of what can be achieved with enormous talent, budget and an exceedingly unhealthy amount of time. It is full of beautiful moments, astonishing scenery and the kind of luxury that few games are capable of.

Ghost of Tsushima

Ghost of Tsushima is a stunning game that represents the pinnacle of the modern console generation. In an era where original properties are becoming rarer, it tells a breathtaking story worthy of of being called one of PlayStation’s best. Accompanied by fantastic combat, a gorgeous open world and great gameplay mechanics, Ghost of Tsushima is an extraordinary adventure that everyone should experience for themselves.
