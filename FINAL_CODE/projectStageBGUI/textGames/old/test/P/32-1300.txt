Among the games that came out this year for PlayStation 4, these are the strongest titles along with their respective scores on Metacritic.

F1 2020 - 86

Racing games are an art of their own. Controls need to feel smooth and easy to use, in order for the experience to be authentic, and this is definitely achieved in F1 2020. If you're passionate about racing and cars, this is as much of a go-to title as the newest FIFA would be to a football lover.

The game introduces real drivers and the actual teams included in the real world F1, and what's better, there's a handy split-screen mode that allows players to compete against their friends. F1 2020 has a total of 22 different tracks, and for a racing simulation is pretty realistic.

Spelunky 2 - 86

Spelunky 2 isn't just a simple platformer, but combines all sorts of different elements into its action and adventure experience. Using the environment to your advantage, you can take down enemies, access new areas and solve puzzles. Best of all, the game looks incredible for a 2D platformer and runs smoothly.

DOOM Eternal - 87

If the mix of science fiction, action, demons and ridiculously powerful FPS game elements sounds like your cocktail of choice, DOOM Eternal might just be your jam. This game truly empowers the player in a way one wouldn't expect, placing them in the shoes of an epic demon slayer.

Tasked with saving the world, your only mission is to fight the demons that threaten to wipe out humanity, while becoming an epic hero in the process. No more pathetic cowering from scary survival horror monsters, because in DOOM the demons cower from you.

7
Final Fantasy VII Remake - 87
Final Fantasy VII Remake Cloud And Sephiroth
The Final Fantasy franchise has been a primordial part of pop culture for ages. In particular, Final Fantasy VII often comes up as a consistent fan favorite due to its touching story and incredible, memorable characters. Its remake definitely lived up to its legacy, and more.

Final Fantasy VII Remake sends you back to the original tale of Cloud, Tifa and the rest you fell in love with, with gorgeous upgraded graphics and smooth combat experience. It really does successfully pay homage to its roots, something which is so difficult to achieve without killing that nostalgia factor.

Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition - 88

Great games don't necessarily have to be top tier when it comes to graphics and innovative gameplay. Sometimes, simple things introduced in a compelling manner is all one needs to make a successful title, and Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition proves that with ease.

Characterized by a unique art style true to Annapurna Interactive's style, this point-and-click adventure is more preoccupied with telling a great story than making you test your skills. Regardless, its adventure akin to real life sucks you in and awakens emotions, as if often typical of successful indie games.

5
Pistol Whip - 88

VR games tend to be a bit of a hit or mess, but Pistol Whip managed to actually entertain its players with how utterly ridiculous and entertaining it is. The world itself is a colorful mess of targets that need to be shot down, but the whole game is more about the experience than the visuals anyway.

It's the perfect game to taste your FPS skills outside of just using a controller or even a keyboard and mouse. This game actually turns you into somewhat of a shooter hero, something which we usually only experience through powerful characters from third-person perspective.

4
Dreams - 89

Creative games are tough to make due to how stiff the competition is for the market, but Dreams is doing a pretty good job so far. From the creators of LittleBigPlanet, one can expect pure joy and wonder in this innovative sandbox game which puts emphasis on creativity.

Players can craft their own games in Dreams, or play those made by other players. It successfully creates a sense of community, while encouraging you to create the types of scenarios and challenges you would most like to experience yourself.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - 89

Living in an era of remakes is controversial. Not all of them are equally good, but Tony Hawk's Pro Skate 1 + 2 delivers and hits a spot. This combination game is fantastic because there's just so much content, gathered from the first two games and upgraded to today's standards.

The nostalgia factor is preserved to perfection with old controls, but with how fun and casual the game feels, even newcomers to the genre will enjoy this blast from the past. No wonder it made it so high in Metacritic with its ability to keep players interested through the map creation mode and character creation and customization.

2
The Last Of Us Part II - 93
The Last Of Us Part II Ellie
The Last of Us is one of the major games of the last decade, and moved even the toughest to tears with its heartbreaking tale of Joel and Ellie through a world plagued by the infected. Needless to say, the developers were in for a challenge to top their achievement with a sequel.

The Last of Us Part II received a degree of controversy over its ending, and some aspects of the story itself. That being said, it still provided incredible gameplay and that trademark deep storytelling which left a lasting mark on its fans. It's likely it will earn the status of game of the year with ease.

Persona 5 Royal - 95

The Persona franchise has been on par with Final Fantasy with how much of a mark it has left on pop culture, and for good reason. Its fifth installment is undoubtedly among the best titles this year, introducing major graphical improvements while maintaining its signature comic book style.

The characters of Persona 5 might seem like regular high school students, but they each have a persona they don which allows them to remove corruption from the hearts of those around them. Fun and a highly immersive story and adventure game with strong RPG elements, Persona 5 doesn't disappoint.
