 
A Masterpiece of Modern Art
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece of modern art. It transcends the barriers of our mere mortal understanding and ascends to a new plane of reality beyond that which we puny humans are even capable of comprehending. It has touched my heart forever, and I am a deeply changed man. I give Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales a perfect score of 100/100, and graciously declare it to be winner of the 2000-3000 Millennium Award. Truly, humanity has finally reached its ultimate evolutionary form.
 
From what I’ve seen
From what I’ve seen it’s a good game but shouldn’t be used for people who are too young because certain things are inappropriate for them I feel it’s more up to the parents if their kid should use this but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone under the age of 12 but i’ve only played it a little bit so take this with a grain of salt
 
Amazing Game
It's an amazing game where you basicly hope you won't die, great to play with your beat of friends and great for the adventurous, just remember to not approach any moving creature.

Amazing
I think this is 12+ because the monsters explode in blood that is green and purple it is also extremely hard and sometimes stressful and in one of the scenes you poke a monster in the eye and your finger gets sticky and gooey

Pretty great game but a little mature
It is a ridiculously fun game that focuses on adapting to your environments in a sci-fi world. While it is a fun game some of the parts in it a bit edgy. It has some high-brow humor and a lot of blood(it is colorful cartoony blood but still). It has some bad words but the worst is the S-word.(even then it blows by pretty quickly)

Decent game with adult themes and some blood.
All throughout the in-game databases and in some dialogue swearing and sexual content is frequent while the actual gameplay has large amounts of blood. The enemies explode in purple and green blood when killed but other than that it’s not that bad. The game is quite fun and it has an interesting story that kept me engaged.

Fun, Addicting, Battle Royale game that isn't too violent
Well this is a great game that I've been playing for a while now. It has become fun but I've kinda gotten tired after 6 months of it. It is a game that if you're worried about FortNite getting to your kid's head is a great solution. It has the same amount of competition, just when you die, you get "creamed" by someone using a weapon made of food. It's incredibly cartoony, and it's fun. One problem, and it may not be a problem for you but I hate it. There is literately no socialization. You can't talk about gameplan or anything. But it's a very fun game otherwise
 
celebration of japanese idol culture with some flaws
The game has some aspects it nails pretty well (for example the fights themselves, which are full of colorfull effects and just overall fun gameplay especially the session mechanic is really fun), but also others (mostly the dungeons) which just feel bland and boring. Overall good, but nothing outstanding.
 
It`s pretty great.
Now as a person who actually played the game and watched the anime this game is pretty great They may say things like hell, bastard and even damn but those are not swear words anyways. What is dragon ball z kakorot? : It is a anime fighting game that follows the dragon ball anime it is not that bad .

Dragon Ball Z back at it again!!!
Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is the newest DBZ game in the series. Violence is the most frequent factor. It's animated Fantasy violence. When getting heavily beat up, clothing will be mildly ripped. Language is mild and infrequent. Use of "@$$", "bastard" and "hell." Sexuality is barely present. Characters sometimes call each other "pervs" and "perverts."

Well, darn. Here we go again with this common NONsense.
Really, common sense media? God you guys should be called common NONSENSE media. The “is it any good?” Section is a plain joke. The game is good. THIS GAME IS GOOD COMMON DORK MEDIA. QUIT WITH YOUR NONSENSE.
 
its sutible for all ages over 8
the game involves mostly fighting but none of the fighting is too graphic. it may show a tiny bit on blood from time to time but its very tame. in this game someones hand is ripped of and someone is impaled with a lazer and some blood is shown but its very tame. the main character Goku can be a good role model he wants to make friends with his enemies and does not want to kill people unless he has too.
 
Good game
The game is mostly about conquering other places and becomeing a powerful empire there is some blood in the battles and violence but mostley.
 
Great game
It’s a brilliant game and extremely relaxing and it’s quite hard but no violence swearing or any bad things.

Beautiful, enchanting and heartfelt expierence!
An amazing piece of art, I'd say! Positive outlook and message. Big themes like life, death, companionship and love. Very clever game mechanics of time manipulation. There are some scary elements too. In chapter "Alone" protagonist must face ominous crowds of shadow people, so for that one, I recommend parental assistance, as it could be too intense for a kid.
 
Detailed
It's pretty detailed.
 
Not good at all, for gamers and parents!
For parents,
Not it should not be rated 18+, but no one should play it. It’s literally a waste of your time.
 
Amazing!
I think that this game is great. You get to build a zoo! If you are an animal lover, I would both recommend and not reccomend this game. There is animal death and fights. But that happens if you have more than one male in an exibit, overcrowding the animals, or if the animals are a competeting species ( like one is a rabbit and one is a fox). 5 star.

This game is totally underrated. It is not 11+, it should be like 3+. The animal fights can be easily averted unless you are stupid, and the blood and gore in only natural for predators. It can let kids (and adults) be creative in building their zoo. This game is as appropriate as Minecraft. If you are looking for an even better game with a similar concept to planet zoo, check out PLANET COASTER.

this game is 100 percet good for all ages
some frightening piil.
 
Cal and BD1 are the 'best buds' Star Wars has sorely needed.
At least some of the reason (I believe) this game is getting stellar reviews and praise has to do with the bar on Star Wars games and media being set so low or being devisive. This lack of universal quality with the movies, Star Wars games (ie Battlefront) and a tanking toy line has left a void and a huge question mark as to if this franchise may be washed up in the foreseeable future.
The GOOD news is that the storytelling here is on par with old school Star Wars as the scenes and characters have the depth, consistency and thoughtful dialogue SW fans have seen lacking as of late. Right down to the cameos and the simple, yet adorable BD1 bot companion your main man Cal totes around, it's all done well and not cheesed up with winks and nods to oversell anything because this stands on it's own merits, as it should.
Other much needed elements are the combat and world traversal. Anyone who's played more modern Prince Of Persia, Uncharted or Dark Siders will instantly note that some pages have been torn and pasted into the caves, outposts and "par core" sections between agressive negotiations with the Empire. Not that this is bad, they are done well and often theatrically, but players exploring these new and familiar worlds may find that they've done this very same thing in other games before.
Combat is fine, but this feels a bit more sluggish and less arcade than The Force Unleashed with it's agressive, over the top powers to crush hordes of foes like a Jedi Hulk. This feels like a bit of Zelda and Dark Souls put together with a more grounded, thoughtful approach (ala Sekiro). You have a lock on, basic attacks and several Force powers to unlock, however, most enemies are dispatched in similar fashion. Which is: sabre attack, block, parry, Force move or wait for an opening after certain tell tale enemy attack pattern to whittle them down. Some enemies have finishing moves you can use on them (with well timed parrys) and there is a simple skill tree to unlock new abilities along the way. Just remember that dying from an enemy attack will send you back to your last save point and you lose your experience points you obtained until you hit the enemy that downed you. It's not a brand new combat system, much like the infused par core tactics it gleens from other games, but it works and gets better with practice /timing. Although with some slight inconsistencies at times, it allows a bit of freedom on how to approach each situation. (Also put the setting to "performance" for console so that timing is not visually off or staggered)
At the end of the day and in this current , well deserved skeptical climate, I get why people are RAVING over this game. However, I think that even a decent game stands out amongst the generic fluff and cash grab sticker slapping corporations have pulled to exploit the Star Wars franchise name (much to the chagrin of George Lucas himself I might add). Jedi: Fallen Order isn't the most unique or ground breaking game ever made, but it is a reminder of a common standard of quality that has been lost over the past several years and that needs to return. And as far as just adding to the Star Wars mythos? This "story" is better than anything we've seen in theaters for years by a long shot. And with the ability to change the difficulty level at any time, the easiest mode should be accessable to anyone even vaguely familiar with modern action games.

Great fun and amazing game!
I have 2 young boys, and they both take turns playing this game. It is fun and interactive, and violence is minimal for a star wars game, with emphasis on puzzle solving. Additionaly, it tells an empowering story for kids about being strong in the face of opression. As long as you trust your kid, this is a great buy!

A great game!
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and I if you want trustworthy reviews for popular games, just take a look and my reviews. This game has only one issue and that is violence. The violence doesn't have any blood but has dismemberment. Dismemberment can only occur on robots and that makes the violence less impactful. This game should be left to ages 9 and up.

This game is absolutely great. The story is simplistic and VERY starwars! There is no swearing and profanity, no sexual content and immodesty. You can tell that the characters within are learning and changing to become better. Jedi are good rolemodels.

This game is a blast for Star Wars fans.
I loved this game, good story, characters. A Star Wars fan like myself would give this 5 stars. I only gave it 4 because someone who isn't into that storyline might not understand/appreciate it. The characters are absolutely fantastic, and really make it much better. Lots of references to other movies/shows. There is some typical staff wars action, blasters and sabers. And some animal dismemberment (no blood).

Beautiful graphics, story-like gameplay
No idea what PEGI were smoking when this got a 16. It is quite obviously very similar to a Star Wars film, so if your kids are up for those then this is a walk in the park. Violence is minimal and 'justifiable', ie much less than the likes of Fortnite. Graphics in 4K on Xbox One X are very lifelike, but not in a frightening way. Gameplay is immersive and based on problem solving, also quite slow in its pace so prevents the aggression that other games can give rise to. Didn't see any bad real world behaviours or swearing. Nothing to worry about here mums and dads :-)

This is an amazing game, for the price might be a little high, but it is EA who made it so, toughen up buttercup! Amazing graphics, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but I was let down a little bit.

One of the best Star Wars games ever made
I was enthralled with this one. It had a great story and amazing characters. The violence is not too bad. You do slice some enemies, but there is absolutely no dismemberment or cutting off (aside from slicing some spiders in half.) Very very little language if any at all, aside from a few "Damns and Hells." The game can be a bit dark and challenging especially on the Dathomir planet. But overall, this is a fantastic game. Highly recommend it for your Star Wars fan in the family. Well done EA and Respawn.

Why I think Fallen order is a good game.
Some people might say this game is rated Teen. It's still very appropriate for even eight and up. However, to fully appreciate and understand the game I think they should be at least ten years old. There is a little more than average of violence but most kids can handle it. Also, the story sends the message of not hiding and being your true self.

Not very graphic
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a science fiction action/adventure game available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Windows-based PCs. The game's set within the expansive Star Wars universe, shortly after the events of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Players take on the role of a young fugitive Jedi on a quest to try to rebuild and restore the Jedi Order. Action is constant, with frequent killing shown onscreen and some intense moments of violence in cutscenes, though no blood or graphic gore's shown. The game emphasizes timing in combat and presents a relatively high degree of challenge, especially at higher difficulty levels. The word "bastard" is heard in some dialogue.
