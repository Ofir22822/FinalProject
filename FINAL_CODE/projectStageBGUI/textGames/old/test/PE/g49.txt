Awesome tool for making whatever your imagination wonders too!!
Dreams is a great engine to create whatever your heart desires in any way, but you can also play the things that other people make. And that’s when it gets slightly inappropriate. Here is a parent review sorted into 5 sections:

VIOLENCE: Violence is limited, and if it gets over the top moderators can remove the creation from the browser. This violence can range from mild-moderate fight scenes, violence such as shooting with blood sprays and splatters, dead bodies and mutilated corpses with innards hanging out rarely.

Inside games, you can also explore dark and disturbing content of any kind, with an exception of rape and sexual harassment.

LANGUAGE: Language is infrequent and hard to find in general, but you may hear some usage of “shit”, “damn”, “hell” and “ass” along with all of its variations. Sometimes, you may find a “fuck” or two that snuck under the moderators

DRUG/ALCOHOL/TOBACCO USE: In games, characters can smoke, show and do drugs etc. without any restrictions.

SEXUAL CONTENT: This is restricted in every way, and you will never see any of this as well as nudity isn’t present.

OVERALL: 12-16+


Its great for content creation, but might be confusing for kids under 10
Don't get me wrong, dreams is an amazing game, especially with the new vr update! there are tons of tutorials where the player has to guide a cone named "Connie" to the exit to save a cube names "Cuthbert" while learning the games creation mechanics in the process, i think its good for kids 10 and up.

Let your mind run ABSOLUTELY wild!!!
Dreams is a game where you can create some things and let your imagination control you. You are able to create levels of pretty much anything, even one of your favourite games. Violence is a bit tough to rate. During the main game, mild and cartoon violence is present. Characters have magical attacks, no blood or gore. Unlike some online content. Some players create levels with violence. There is no actual blood, players use red paint to make blood effects in the environment when making say a "horror" level. Use of "$h!t" is surprisingly heard in the demos, use of "damn" and "hell." But not frequent.

Curentley One of My Favorite Games
Dreams is a great tool used for creation of games, music, &amp; so much more! Sure, there can be meme stuff, (Like Shrek.) but its mainly just people being creative. Check me out! Its badj0kes2012 on Dreams.

Perfect for Younger Children.
This game is actually really good for children despite the reviews. To be very honest, the game is very well made and tailored for children to play.

I've been waiting for this
Yakuza and Yakuza 2 have both been remastered as Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2. The three next games don't get the exact same treatment but are still in full HD. Violence is brutal. Punches and kicks result in blood splatters. Note: Gore can be turned off. Strong language is occasionally heard (but said in Japanese). Use of "f#!k", "@$$", "$h!t", "Goddamn", "bull$h!t" and "b!#ch." Sexuality isn't as explicit. Some female characters are hostess that you can flirt with. Some clubs have dancers on poles with provocative clothing. One male character's but is seen once.

bad game
you should never let your kids play it.

Quite Cool
I like the game over all. I think it is a bit gory at some parts including exploding zombies, heads being blown off and slow motion visuals of organs being shot (but this can be turned off) ect. I would recommend this to people 13 and up.
 
Is it okay for most kids
it is really fun to play and it has a couple swear words here and there but not a ton, the swear words include the f-word but that is said rarely and the s-word also rarely but not as rare, and d*mn't not so rare like it is like the show the language is not often really bad words. It has little swearing so that if it wasn't gory it could be rated 10 and up or teen 12 and up and the only way I wouldn't let my kid play this is if I was over protective and/or they or I didn't like blood. I let my 10 year old kids play it and I am normally a pretty strict parent about what they play and watch. I don't let them play games when you kill people but in this you don't kill people so I let them play it. Were are also a very strict christian family. But I think you should let your kids play it plus its a good survival game and fast paced a lot of the time

Walking Dead VR
The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners helps breath life into The Walking Dead franchise. With exciting storytelling and great companions, this games lets you feel for your environment by being very immersive with its cartoony atmosphere. With it being Walking Dead, occasional swearing is heard and you do have the option to drink alcohol, but the game doesn’t want you to, as the alcohol has a negative affect on your stamina. Finally, the violence. Without the violence, I might have given it a ten and up. I gave it a 14+ because although the gore is cartoony, brutality is still an aspect of the game, but I would still let a 14 year old or a mature 13 year old play this game. Have fun, and be safe!.
 
One of the best vr games ever
One of the best vr games ever, although there is some gore ( you can cut off zombies heads and limbs and if you stab you get blood on your hands) and some swearing (including f**k and s**t) it is not to over top in either aspects. Also you can smoke and drink alcohol which bring down your max health and stamina respectively ( in other terms it is it is a bad choice) overall it is not bad if your child has seen a rated r movie or played a rated m game. 5 stars.

best game evver
i think its really good game but i wouldn't recommend it for kids under the age of 14 unless they are mature enough to play. sure there is some swearing and tones and tones of gore but you know what you are getting when you buy it. i also like how when you drink or smoke your health will go down it shows a good role models to the younger players.

A very fun game, however necessary violence
Ok, I love this game. It was creepy at first and took some getting used to. I love the show, so I have been used to zombies, however it could disturb younger kids, unless they are mature enough to not be afraid. There is violence, including the options to kill, and even behead people. However, it is mainly in self defense, though the choice is always present to kill people randomly. They don't show any ofiof it detailed. Language is present, but come on, if you were in an appocolypse, wouldn't you be swearing? F bombs are there, but understandable in the situations. Most kids here cursing at school, anyway, so parents should know that as long as their child is mature enough, they shouldn't be bothered by words. There is also the option to smoke and drink, but it harms you, so that is a good role model.

Exellent
The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is very fun and immersive Game. That being said the game is very violent, pretty much any human/Zombie in the game is killable. You can shoot them bash their head in or cut off their limbs. If your kid has played an M rated game or watched an R rated movie it shouldn’t be too much for them

Great for a Mature 11,12 year old.
Alright, so this is an amazing game I'm just gonna say that. If you grew up playing shooters or call of duty, taking down zombies is a no-brainer. And in VR it just makes it so much better. Of course there is the occasional F or S word but they are VERY rare and can only be heard when you start shooting like innocent people or raiders. ( Which the game discourages you to do or else you might get a bad reputation. ) And the gore is what you would expect in a zombie game. Standard blood stuff but not to gory. Of course if you can get a shotgun to a walkers head, it comes off but it doesn't have good blood graphics really and it doesn't feel like your really doing it. 10/10 is a must for anyone who owns a VR headset.

This is one of my favorite vr games currently. That being said it does have some pretty bad language and is really graphic. It is also really intense and scary at a lot of times

2nd best VR game
TWD saints and sinners is one of the best VR games made to this day. I would give the story 7/10 and gameplay 9/10. Violence is really the only thing you should consider before letting your kid play the game. You can use an arsenal of melee weapons such as knives and swords to decapitate and brain walkers. Or guns to take them down long-range. There is blood but it’s not overdone, if you stab a walker with a knife some blood will get on your hands and arms. One thing you need to keep in mind is that you have a choice to kill humans, you don’t need to at any point but it is pushed two times. I would give saints and sinners a 9/10 for teens 15+.
