Family Fun
I have been playing this with my two sons, ages 14 and 7. I love it as much as they do. It's super fun to visit each other's islands and share resources. We love waking up to see that a new bridge has been completed or someone new has moved in. The game's release is helping our time at home more exciting.

Fun title unless you want to play together.
This game is very fun and cute, but the only person who can really enjoy the game is the first one to launch it. The “Island Representative” will make all progress and decisions for the island, for the entire time. The villagers and characters treat the IR like they are special, but kinda ignore and leave out any other players that login. Yes you can interact, but you will not be able to progress or even help progress the island without the first player. The simultaneous multiplayer is also very limited. The only way to get around this is to buy another switch and another copy of the game. This might lead to a lot of hurt feelings if you have multiple kids who want to play the game.

Be aware of naked artwork
Amazing game! Just be aware that later in the game you can collect famous pieces of art (like the statue of David) that depict people nude. Also be aware that there is potential to interact and chat with other people online if you have a linked Nintendo account.

The best in the franchise!
This the the best Animal Crossing game ever! The Nook miles activities will definitely keep you busy and the fact that you have to build everything from the ground up is even better.

A wholesome escape for all
In this current trying times, the world of Animal Crossing has never seemed like a better place to engross yourself into. Furthermore, it is the best game in the series so far; I continue to be amazed as I play in how they thought of every single "issue" - some quite minuscule or matters of opinion - from New Leaf and fixed it, offering a large world the player can make their own with their own unique style of play. There is no objectionable content in this game; the player can get stung by wasps and apply medicine or bitten by a tarantula and momentarily pass out before awakening back at their home. These are very mild incidents that are top level of peril in this game, and are unlikely to seriously frighten or concern even the youngest of players. New Horizons also brings back an educational outlet in allowing Blathers, the owl who runs the museum, to give the player educational facts about the birds, bugs, and fossils they present to him if they allow him to. The only reason I put 5+ instead of a lower rating is because of the reading level; parents may need to be of assistance for very young children.

Absolutely Adorable!!!
Just another cute Animal Crossing game. Not as good as New Leaf as far as game play goes but it’s still a really good game. Beautiful graphics on the Switch. It’s release was delayed to make it better and it paid off. Much better than Pokémon Gen 8 on the Switch where everything good is pay walled. It was worth the wait. My favorite thing is fishing and bug collecting. The fish and bugs look much better with the Switch graphics. A much clearer upgrade from what I have seen on the N64, Game Cube, DS, 3DS, and mobile game (haven’t played the Wii game or the Wii U game so I can’t compare). It’s not violent unless you count getting stung by bees from time to time as violent. It’s just a fun relaxing game that is a good stress relief.

Animal Crossing pulls off another great game in the series
After Animal Crossing : New Leaf, you'd think that a game better than it couldnt be possible. New Leaf was a game that redifined the life sim genre. It was basically an endless game, so much stuff to do and complete.
Enter, New Horizons!
This is a fantastic step forward in the Animal Crossing series.
The game is about your character moving to a new island. Its whats called a life sim, meaning that you control your characters day to day activities. There is an extremely high amount of things to do. Fish, talk to villagers, shop for items for your character etc.
It manages to bring all the features from New Leaf, make them better, and add a whole lot of new stuff!
The graphics are high res and have had a huge upgrade from its predecessor. It's are cartoonish and very cute.
The dialogue spoken by the animal villagers of the island is just murmurs and unaudible jibbersh which means no vulgar language is spoken at any time.
There is no violence whatsoever.
Sex is nonexistant.
The game can also be educational at times, teaching debt, and managing money.. Please.
Don't waste your time reading another review. No matter if youre an adult or a kid, anyone can enjoy this game.

This Game is Really Good but not Fun in Multiplayer
This game is awesome but only the player who is the Island Representative which is the person who first opens get to really play it. What I mean by this is that when I played I was able to play the story but than when my many family members played they did not get to do the story. So really if you have many kids or many people who want to play the game on the same switch it will not really work out well.

Best Game Ever!
Animal Crossing New horizans is a fantastic game about exploring, socializing, and creativity. You get to design your home, go fishing, discover characters, etc. It is a very fun game that makes time pass by and it is very entertaining, but the only slight concern is that you get to play and chat online although, you can only do it with your nintendo friends.
I recommend this game for all ages!

Your child must be able to read!
This game is extremely easy to play as long as you can read. You will also need to learn to spend in-game money as well. The game is very fun and allows for a lot of innovation and creativity. You CAN chat and visit other players islands, so if you have a younger child you may want to monitor them.

This is my favourite game ever.
This is the next level of animal crossing. There is more customisation. When you reach the end of the game, you can completely change up your island and make it a paradise. I recommend this game, especially since we are in quarantine.

Internet Access
Okay - the actual game is 5 stars. It has beautiful graphics, an impressive storyline, and best of all it provides a safe environment for interacting with others.

But to continue in the game after a while, you need to BUY an add on to the Switch, internet access. $60 annually for 8 accounts. Outrageous. This is to go to their islands, find new fruits, etc. Additionally, to get to the upper level(s) of your island, you need a ladder, but to get the craft instructions for the ladder you need to travel to another island first.

Nintendo ruined a perfectly good game by tricking us into paying more for what we get.

Animal Crossing New Horizons
Everyone in the world has been bored on at least one Saturday in their life. That is a fact. It is so easy to get lost in a Nintendo Switch game. However, it is so hard to find a game on the Nintendo Switch these days that is worth playing. Well if you are trying to find a game that is kid-friendly (but also some adult fun), single-player or multiplayer, AND worthy of your money, buy Animal Crossing New Horizons. Animal Crossing New Horizons is totally worth it! There are many ways to play. You can either speed right through it, or enjoy the process. That is how most life works. However, both can apply to ACNH. The storyline is so complex and elaborate. From the simple beginning to a successful life. Even though a bit confusing at first, ACNH is a creative game right from the start! The animation of ACNH is a combination of realistic, intricate, and just perfect design and animation. Let’s talk about the villagers. So what about them. Well, they certainly not like those blockheaded, non-speaking, and most of their trades are useless villagers in Minecraft. In fact, I want you to name five things that they have in common besides the name. Well? I can’t think of one. Can you? Anyhoo! Villagers are one of the most important parts of the game. Each named, designed and catchphrased. To make this more clear, villagers are all put into different categories. It’s based on their animal type (Why did you think it was called animal crossing? Plus, I will not name them) and personality (Normal, Cranky, Snooty, Sisterly, Peppy, Lazy, Jock). Double plus! They each have a name (Food-based, Celebrity based, and “Grandma based”).

Honestly...
Hello there, if you are thinking of getting animal crossing, there are a few downsides, online chat, and classical nude art, and upsides, it's educational, fun, and cute.


plus, one of the main characters, isabelle, IS THE CUTEST THING ON EARTH AND I WANT TO SNUGGLE HER YFTYRDCGHHKMMUGF




(warning to all females, she will definetly make you a lesbian)

Great Game!
ACNH is very fun and I would recommend it for any age except that you need to know how to read. All of the dialogue is shown in text boxes. There is nothing inappropriate or anything like that. It is possible to visit other people's islands but if your child is young I would recommend not allowing them to do trades and such online as they may not be able to tell between trustworthy and not trustworthy people.

Amazing game! Im addicted!
Good game definitely worth the money, and the literal definition of child friendly. No swear words, fun colorful graphics, and fun for all.
My favorite characters are blue bear, pudge, and Stella.
Parents please buy this for your child on Christmas if they have a Nintendo switch. I recommend 4 and up because I knew how to hold a controller when I was that age. Amazing game I love it

Is fun for the first two months, then gets boring
It takes around 2 weeks to beat the main story of the game, in which your deserted island transforms from a small village to a bustling town. After beating the main game, you basically just decorate your island and that’s it. The dialogue between you and your villagers feel repetitive. I feel like you need to be around ten to fully understand what do to in order to beat the game, since a lot of hints and directions are told through text that younger kids may not understand.

ACNH IS COOL!!!!!
My judging on animal crossing is that its very like a life simulation, the game is extremely positive and the villagers are really cute, the only problem with it is that there is a touch of bad language in it.

Overall, I'd say this game is appropriate for ages 9+.

Adorable Game for a Wide-Spread Range of Ages!
this game is incredibly cute and fun, but also incredibly frustrating and filled with tasks. I do not recommend buying this for someone under the age of 8 as they will most likely be bored out of their minds and have trouble reading most dialogue!
