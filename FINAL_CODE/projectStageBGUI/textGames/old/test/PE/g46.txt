 
If you let your kid play Fortnite this should be ok
Basically Fortnite but just more realistic animation.

Yeah... it’s still COD.
So, Warzone just came out. It’s fun. It’s free. If you get the chance play it, have fun. There are some new things if you are looking for a NEW battle royals.
All of the mature content in this game is very straight forward. Violence is the most prominent thing. Shooting, with spurting ... continue reading

Not violent
This games violence is only around an age 14+ but if you turn of blood in the settings this turns of all swearing and blood/gore making the game a 12 with around the sameviolence or less than Overwhatch or Paladins.
READ THIS BEFORE YOU STOP YOUR CHILD FROM PLAYING COD WARZONE
Some parents say these kind of games has too much violence and is very addictive, but take it from someone who has been playing video games for a long time, it's not addictive at all nor is it 'THAT' violent. There is even a way to turn off 'blood' in the game. As all of you respected parents know, it's encouraged to stay home due to the
COVID-19 outbreak and sometimes kids can get very annoyed. In my opinion this is a very good way to keep them busy. You can also control the time frame that kids play this game. All I'm saying is that it's totally fine for a child over the age of 10 to play.

Good game for younger kids
If you play this game without any custom settings it is not appropriate at all for tweens and young teens. I found out that you can turn the blood, gore, and swearing off. There are also no dead bodys lying around unlike the other call of duty games. And the stickers are not as bad as I thought if you've ever seen someone in a bikini, then you should be fine considering that a bikini shows more than the stickers.

Ok for kids!
Personally, I thought this game looked really unsuitable. I did some research and found out that there is a way to remove dismemberment/ blood and gore. There is also a way to remove all profanity and text chat from the game to make sure your child does not encounter anything bad.
Overall in terms of violence kids should be allowed to play it as long as there is the content filter active. To activate it you must press start (button with 3 lines) on xbox and options/touchpad on ps4. This must be done whilst in the lobby. If you are not very tech-savvy but know someone who is, get them to help you set it up.

A good Battle Royal
Basically Warzone is Fortnite with a more realistic / gritty coat of paint. The game is a shooter that has some blood, but violence is mostly seen from a distance. The game has a bit more of an aggressive feel than Fortnite, which is especially evident in the "Gulag" section of the game where players battle each other 1 vs 1, but it's not substantially more violent than an average shooter. Players online are known to curse, but chat can be disabled.

tweaking needed
Okay so if your child has no custom settings then yes i agree with common sense media. but if you turn of all blood and mature language i would be more worried about your child playing rocket league. just make sure your kid has the gore and language of and its a very fun game to play in lock down.

Great alternative to other call of duty games.
At first I thought, oh no this is not appropriate at all. After hours of begging I finally looked into it and saw that I can turn off the blood, gore, and language. It was basically like playing pubg (player unknown battlegrounds). I think that it is a better fit for younger kids that want to play other call of duty games. It's also free so if you don't like what you see you can easily delete it without losing any money.

Amazing war game mode with intense violence and occasional language
CoD Warzone is an amazing war game with gunplay and bloody images. You are dropped into a map with 100-150 players and are tasked with 1 of these 2 objectives: Get the most money the fastest, or be the last one standing alive.

Killing is required for victory, but is mostly spread out and less frequent due to the idea of not wanting fights with others. Taking peaceful routes will most likely lead you to victory more often in one mode but otherwise you should kill those that threaten you. When you shoot other players a fair amount of blood flies out onto surfaces, but this really isn’t any worse than previous titles and some T rated video games.

Occasionally, you will hear some usage of “f**k” in game dialogue and strong language from other players which can be muted. This is infrequent compared to campaign in Modern Warfare.

This game is probably most appropriate for 12+

Great game
This is a great game for children age 12 or above because you can turn blood off and swearing off which would actually take it down to a 12 rated game anyway. It’s very similar to pubs. I let both of my 12 year old children play it and they love it, it keeps them quiet and at first I watched them play it and I thought that it was fine.

ITS NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK
the game isn't bad at all and is truly pretty fun it reminds of Fortnite just more realistic you can turn off blood/ gore if that's not your thing you can also take off swearing as well, overall if you have a child that really wants to play call of duty but you're afraid of cussing, blood/gore than this is the game for you plus it's free so if you end up thinking the game is too mature for your young one you can just uninstall it without losing your money, and if you think your kid is mature enough than you wouldn't need to worry as the game doesn't have bodies everywhere; correct me if I'm wrong, but I play the game and overall its pretty fun if you have the right setting on you'll be fine

Please read before making a decision for your child.
Honestly, this game isn't as bad as you might think. You have to understand that COD has blood and such, but you can turn all of that off in settings. If your child is mature enough and has seen some movies with combat, maybe consider letting them play. My daughter has wanted this game for a while and I kept saying no, I eventually went online and read some reviews and I decided that is was okay. She is 12. If you've let your child get games such as 'fortnite' in the past, this one is fine. It's just a more realistic version. It all depends on your child's maturity.

Good game for teens.
Yes this game made for people over the age of 18, but personally, I think that kids of the age of 13 should be able to play. I only say this about the kids who are mature enough to play. For example, if your child is getting gets scared at the sight of blood or in-game death then I don't recommend letting your child play. There are also some upsides to this game. Since we are supposed to be quarantine this game allows your child to have fun and communicate with their friends without going outside. So in summary, if your child is of the range of 13 and mature enough to play then you should allow your child to play Call of Duty: Warzone or any Call of Duty game. And parents, don't always make your decisions based on what the news says. Here is an idea, you as parents/gardens should play the game to see what you think and who knows you might even like it.

ok for kids 11 and up
I think this game is a great alternative to other Call Of Duty games.
at first I thought it was way too gory but once I learned that you could disable the blood and gore and in game chat I was ok with it.

Great game!
This game is great! Its not to gory and the language can be easily turned off. The worst gore is probably a severed arm or leg. This game is great for friends to play as a team and its very addicting there is no nudity or drugs in the game. And its free! Its a great game!
