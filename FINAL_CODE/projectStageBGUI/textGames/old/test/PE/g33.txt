My 8 year old loves this game!
My 8-year-old got this game today, and he loves it! I watched him play so I could make sure it is appropriate for him, and I believe it is. While, it is violent in some ways, and bloody in others, the game teaches kids about the importance of sharks for our marine environments. I definitely recommend this educational and over the top game for ages 8 and up, depending on your childs maturity.

Maneater
In Maneater, you play as a shark who wants revenge on the shark-hunter who killed your mum. Along the way, you also eat tons of people, fish and battle other sharks to get stronger. When you kill a person, there is lots of blood and gore as you rip them apart, so it's safe to say this game isn't appropriate for kids. For the first couple of hours or so, Maneater is good fun but it does get a little repetitive after a while. There's not much to do apart from kill, kill, kill. To conclude, Maneater should be OK for teens aged 15 and up.

Educational shark game, the kids'll love it
Theres lots of blood and some dismemberment but its all in good fun.
 
A day (or two) of eating glorious seafood and long pig!
Everyone loves sharks.

Although it's longevity is not the best, it is still very fun! Of course there's blood and gore like that, it may be unsettling for some people, but from my experience you'll get used to it.
It's very easy too! I didn't look up any guides except when finding collectibles. You can finish the game in a weekend, and get all the achievements too.

Definitely NOT for kids under 10!!!
This game is filled what awesomeness and fun! But the downside it that this game’s gore it absolutely everywhere. The blood spatters, pools of blood in the water, and killing humans and revenge is the #1 thing! Now it isn’t my choice wether you get this game or not but on my end I recommend you don’t get this for 10 year olds, wait till they are 12-14.

Intense Shark Game
Yes, this is a shark game so expect blood...a lot of it
I have played this game for about 5 hours so far and I have learned that the story is about a shark trying to avenge its mother. There is swearing BUT it is bleeped out since this is based off a TV show called maneater.
There is no sex except women in bikinis. There is one scene of where the antagonist (Scaly Pete) of his arm getting bitten off, players are then forced to eat his hand as it is leaking blood in the water. The blood is WAY over the top but it looks really cartoony.
There is one mention of drugs.
There is some dirty jokes but it's just a penis joke.
Overall I think this game would be great for kids age 12 and up.
If your kid is young, you can watch a gameplay video on youtube.

Very good game for young teens
I feel like this game is ok for 12 year olds because the there is no gore (but there is a little blood), the language is no worse than what some parents say, and the sexual parts are not that bad. Another thing about these styles of games (gta,watch dogs2, and saints row) is you can choose to do bad things or not
I think kids over 12 could play the game since all you’re doing is virtual. And as long as you don’t do it in real life I think you should play it. But this game is violent to younger kids so don’t let them play it. 12 and over

Good Game!
As someone who is a teenager, playing this game when I was younger wasn't a bad. It has some violence, drug references, and language and maybe even sex one or a few times. But honestly, my parents didn't care but all parents are different. If I was a parent I'd let my kid play if they know the difference between a video game and life I recommend this game!

A Great And Amazing Game
The Sexual Content And Drug References Are Barly Even There And All Nudity Is Censored. However,
It Is Very Violent So I Would Say 10-13+.
It's Is Just A Great Game In General And Has A Lot Of Moral Choices.

THIS GAME IS GOOD!!!!
I think it is a awesome open world game that everyone has to try. You can be the POTUS of America.

This is a fun game
This is a great game.

One of the best games in the series, but is a little difficult.
I have no idea why this is rated teen. Probably the most inappropriate part is that you can make the characters wear bikinis, but it is just cartoon and there no actual nudity. There is no swear words as far as I'm concerned because all of the actual singing is in Japanese, but no one who doesn't speak Japanese would understand the song's even if they did have curse words. The reason I would rate this 12+ is because of it's difficulty. After more then 6 months of practice, the best I have done is perfecting an 8 extra extreme. This game is perfectly fine for younger kids as long as they stick to the easy and normal difficulties. I would say that you should be 10 plus to play the hard difficulty and 12 plus to play extreme/extra extreme difficulty songs. This game may also be very frustrating without practice, but once you know how to play, it will become one of the best rhythm games you will ever play.

Rhythm game is really fun!
This is a really fun but difficult rhythm game for the Nintendo Switch. The game itself is not inappropriate, as it is a rhythm game. The only thing to consider is that some lyrics (even though they are Japanese) have some sexual/inappropriate themes. Otherwise it is a really fun game that you should definitely play!

The best video game for young weebs and vocaloid fans!
This game is amazing! Some music videos are violent, sexy or depressing, and some lyrics are suggestive, but they are all in Japanese, so only if your child knows Japanese, they won't understand. Overall great game! 10/10 for me.

just a normal music game
It's just a normal game about music but it's made for vocaloid fans and weebs, who are people into anime (type of Japanese cartoon). The game does have some explicit words but it's all in Japanese so as long as your kid doesn't know Japanese it's all good.

Exactly what the description says - Fun, not easy
Project Diva Megamix is an entertaining and challenging game featuring Vocaloid - a Japanese voice synthesizer that is used to make songs (some of which are pretty catchy). The game itself has simple controls, but difficult levels that take advantage of the fact that you only have two thumbs. It can take innumerable attempts to pass even some some of the normal levels, so this game clearly isn’t for everyone. The only age problems I could see is that there are several swimsuit outfits available for each character, and in the video for Sweet Devil, the camera pans across Miku’s body for a few seconds. It doesn’t “show” anything too bad though.
