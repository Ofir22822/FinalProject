Ladder repair simulator.
Theres very little violence or gore. Its mostly walking and puzzles with an occasional mutilated animal (its often too dark to see them well). The hearts are surreal enough to not be gory (just weird). The blood looks really fake and bad (like mud or oil).
The devs couldnt be bothered to make actual combat but you sure spend a lot of time repairing ladders and chopping veggies manually (including selecting tools). What you get is a typical indie walkie horror that pads itself with busywork depriving itself of the brisk minimalist gameplay of Outlast . Its inconsistent tone and campy voice acting also ruins the atmosphere, further dampening the lackluster story. At least the production values are good for a 2-man team, and there is so bad its good dialog.

dat wat my mama said
for the movie its PG-13 i dont know why common sense thinks its worse to play violent games than movies like for a game they might do 15+ and for a movie with the same amount of violence they will do 11+ so confusing but if those curses are frequent it might need to turn up a little. you see it could be for like 10 to 18 year olds to start it depends how much they are used to the violence. you see i am 8 i witnessed happy tree friends i thought it was happy but it was very gross and scary instead that might be a 15-22. if you arent ready but in reality should be 15-18.

Bad game based on the movies
Terrible adaption from the movies, and there is lots of swearing and killing involved.

Tween-friendly strategy does not make you feel like John Wick
While the mechanics are ambitious and mostly functional, it ultimately feels to slow and clunky to make you feel like Baba Yaga. The janky animations and bad camera angles in cinematic mode make you feel like youre watching a bad fan film. Unlike the movies, there is no graphic violence, and like the movies there only occasional profanity.

really good
level 56 is really hard, bob the robber on hudgames has to work hard.

Eh a bit boring.

kool
good.

BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
There is a lot of combat because it's a beat'em up. Some people wear clothing which shows there legs and arms, and alcohol bottles are used to whack enemies with. There are cutscenes where there are uses of hell and pissed . There are shadows inside bars and some of shadows are of people drinking. That's about it. (It's quite hard. I'm on the last level and it is EXTREMELY difficult. I CAN'T GET PAST IT!

More of the same, but still incredible.
The gameplay feels very similar to Her Story (A game by the same developer), but I felt this was overall a better game compared to Her Story. The story was incredible, albeit a bit slow or messy at parts, but still an experience I recommend to everyone old enough to get the depth. That said, there isn’t much content that I don’t think teens could handle, but this isn’t a game meant for kids, so I recommend that it is only played by young adults who can understand it to the fullest.

Immersive, slightly creepy mystery.
No explicit content. Just very mature themes explored through uncoventional gameplay. One girl is a cam worker but her outfits never get too revealing; and nothing explicit or exploitative is ever shown.
The game really sells its concept with its faux desktop and interaction with many little, sometimes unshown details; which gets you more into the interesting mystery. It demands exceptional patience and attention to detail through LOTS of sometimes mundane footage. But thats part of the intended experience; as indulgent as it may seem to many players. Also love LMG

A good remake
Two Big Thumbs Up!!! Something you should keep in mind is the costumes, especially the characters Riesz and Angela, they have some very showy costumes but if you look past that it is a incredible game :)
why 11 year olds who have this game
it's basically Call of Duty but like if you're aliens and aliens are not real soif you like shooting aliens and stuff that was it matter as much has shooting real people.
WARNING
Hunting Grounds is easily one of the worst games to come out this year. I know, all the other reviews say it's great and worth your time, it's not. It's simply not. Just imagine this. Imagine you buy a AAA game at full price. You are expecting a great action packed Predator game. Now reality check. The game has one mode. One. You can only play one mode in a AAA $40 game. It has three maps which is terrible but they are all rehashes of each other. This will be remembered as one of the worst games of the year. The people who reviewed the game and say it's good, well They don't know what makes a good game good and a bad game bad.

VERY, VERY, VEEERY GOOD (but brutal)
I usually dont agree with CSM but this time they underrated it. Lots of violence and swearing. The predator can blow up People and RIP out their backbone and skull. The fireteam can shoot arms off and blow up heads, resulting in Lots of blood. The F word and the S word is mentioned a lot of times.

i love this but...
The game contains violence blood and gore.you have two options to play as Fireteam or Predator.When playing as fireteam you hve 3 other people with you have to complete missions or kill predator.When playing as Predator its way harder you have weapons to choose from same as fireteam but your goal is to kill every member of fireteam you need to down the then claim them claiming is taking their skull with spine its brutal you can quick claim or long claim quick claim is quick takes around 2sec. while long claim takes around 7sec. while long claiming you will get more XP when fireteam before fireteam finishes you off you option to heal or self destruct.self destruct is also option when you are finished its the only option when you finished.The game includes alot of strong language a lot like F??K,S??t and more.why i think 11+ can handle it well the game is fun while there is blood and strong language you can play with friends or with random people.The big- is that the loading times are so loooong it can take over 45mins to find a game as a predator but that can be fixed i hope.there are DLC,s every month.

Not very bloody and mild language
It’s not very bloody on the fire team side where you shoot and even with the predator and there’s barely any gore there’s one move you have to do to secure your kill which is ripping there spine out but the good things is. Is that you can either do a quick kill or long kill and both are not cinematic which means there’s not much blood

Mostly violent
If you let your kid play DooM then this is fine, but if you don't, its probably still fine, the only thing I have against it is the amount of cussing.

What? This game is actually pretty bloody. I was 100% expecting an 18+ because they give almost any video game that’s a realistic FPS and 18+. How is halo ( a way less bloody game) have an 18+ while this game is only 16+? I wouldn’t care as much if they gave other games less of an age rating. I am very confused.

Online only game has gore and strong language
Parents need to know that this game is filled with gory fun. Based on the Predator movies, this game has one player play as the predator who hunts down and kills the other four players. The predator is an alien who uses wrist blades, laser cannon, and more to kill his victims. It will claim "trophies" by tearing out a player's spine with the skull still attatched, Mortal Kombat style. The bloody violence is toned down a bit though because the blood is bright red and looks really unrealistic. You will hear a few uses of f--k and s--t as well, but the main issue is the violence. I reccomend this game to adults who want a fun game to play with friends.

Not That Bad
This game sure has blood but if your kid has played DOOM Eternal the game looks like AC. The blood for the predator is green and the human blood is fine. All you need is are responsible kids.

This game has some violence but it’s mostly when you play as predator and you barely play as predator and you mostly play as the hunters and you should let your kid play this game if there mature enough and if they know none of it is and they know it’s just a game

GET TO THE CHOPPA
I believe while this game is a on the gore side of the spectrum and uses some swear words it is definitely more tame than I expected, because I thought there would be more cinematic and graphic moments and cutscenes.

overall I believe young teenagers would be able to play it because it is a fun little multiplayer game and your children have most likely already seen the gory parts by watching footage of it on places like YouTube and twitch.
