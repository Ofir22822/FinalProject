Great for 10+
This is an awesome, fast, adrenaline fueled racer. There are NO people anywhere in the city so running people over like in GTA is not an issue.

Best racing world game ever, but iffy for young kids
This game got E10+ for a REASON. I think it's so addicting. There is a online alternative: It's called "Burnin' Rubber 4" I've only played the demo, but it's fun enough. The D.J. Says "Whoever that person is, we wish him the best." When you've been driving crazy

Great game and tells kids how NOT to drive!
GREAT game i love it! It also makes it easier to teach kids how to NOT drive if you talk about how the driving in the game is very offensive and can get them punished by the law then they will not do it but since you can take pictures of yourself when you get wrecked online safety may be a problem but it is a great racing game with lots of action that kids will love!

This game is fun from what was on the demo. But there are lots of bad messages; you're suppose to drive recklessly, bump into other cars, and drive purposely into private property to bust builten boards. The comentator even encourages you to do so. I didn't hear any language it must only be in the real game. If you understand that driving like this in real life is NOT okay, then this can be a really fun game for you.

Welcome to Anti-Driver's Ed.
Burnout Paradise is probably the best of the series. First, it gives the player the option of competition-free 'Freeburning' while not racing (or doing other illicit driving activities such as Road Rage and Stunt Run). This allows the player to cruise around Paradise City, driving in fictional cars (based on real ones, though) and become more familiar with the city so that they can play better in events.
The maniacal driving can become very violent-cars can be compacted to half their size, torn in half, and, plainly, disfigured. Fortunately, no human beings drive these cars. They eerily drive themselves, so blood and gore is not an issue.
The most important factor is that this game encourages players to slam, crush and obliterate cars in a way that demonstrates a total lack of respect for the other drivers' safety. Paradise should only be given to your kid (or teen) after a thorough discussion of how these intended car crashes (known as Takedowns) are meant to stay in the game. And if they are not convinced, make sure they know that if they attempt to barrel roll off the side of a parking garage, their car will end up as a pile of twisted metal, not the car of a brave daredevil.

Burnout Paradise is a fun game, and can be expanded with add-on's from the Xbox LIVE Marketplace or the Playstation Store. Have fun burning through Paradise City in an intensely maniacal fashion!

cars are awesome, gameplay is so-so.
The cars are really awesome, but the game itself is boring. you just drive around aimlessley crashing cars, and the races are really tough and marked mans arent much better. oh yeah its also violent too seeing as you crash other cars badly to unlock them, and it has some consumerism with cars but kids arent gonna want to buy a hunter mesquite if they play this game

Medioker racing game is ok for kids.
The gameplay is kinda clunky, but the cars are awesome. and i guess you could call it violent cause you have to crash a car REALLY bad to unlock it. it also has bad messages, but i would rather call it bad education, because its pretty much teaching you how to drive like a maniac and wreck other cars, which teens shouldnt see if their the ride-in-the-back-of-pickup-truck type.

dont let teenagers who are driving play it.
This game is actually off for 15-20 because it teaches you how to drive like a maniac, and teenagers probably will wqant to drive like a maniac if they play this. But its ok for 15 and under and 21 and over. And it may say language on the back but i havent heard any after almost a year of playing it.

Best Burnout Yet!
Burnout Paradise is the best racing game I have ever played! The ESRB rating says language and violence but I have played for 12+ hours and I haven't heard any language. The point of the game is to 'Takedown' other cars and you can hit normal traffic but there are no people in the game at all, not on the street or in the cars so there is no violence against humans. Great game for anyone 10+.

Take me down to the paradise city...
For those of you who have no idea what the Burnout franchise is, it is essentially an arcade racing series that started in 2002. The games contain a great sense of speed and features spectacular crashes.The main difference in Paradise is that it now has an open world whereas the others didn't. That means that in a race, you could take any route to the goal. Let me list off the events in BP. The Race event is pretty self explanatory. Road Rage is a returning event, where the goal is to destroy your opponent's cars up, and is my favorite. Marked Man is a mode where you go from point A to point B while trying not to be taken out by cars that were probably made by the British Secret Service. In Stunt Run, you basically do all kinds of stunts to rack up the most points possible. Every car you unlock has a corresponding Burning Lap, which is just a Point A to Point B run. Nothing special. Finally, there's Showtime. If you played Burnout 2,3, or 4, you know that there is a crash mode where you make the biggest traffic pile-up possible. Showtime is the replacement of Crash Mode, where you hit a couple buttons and start destroying cars. You just hit a button and keep plowing into these cars and is so incredibly entertaining. It's the most "objectionable" part of the game, so if you're having trouble deciding if it's appropriate for your children, I'd recommend checking out a YouTube video or something. Lastly, there are the updates you can get if your PS3/X360 is hooked up to the internet. These include new online events, motorbikes, and a day/night cycle. Now that I'm finished rambling on about the game, is it the best Burnout game? The answer is: No. Burnout 3 for the PS2/Xbox (and the Xbox 360 via the Marketplace) is the best Burnout title. But nonetheless, this game is a must own in your gaming library.

weird, unrealstic game.
OK, but not the best racing game. i wouldnt like it at all if the cars werent cool, wich is one of the only good things in this game. the racing isnt too good, mainly because its hard. but if your kid really wants it, its probably OK for 7+, because the crashes arent as bad as they are in other racing games.

This is a brilliant racing/crashing game that is fun for ages. Its extremely educational. How not to drive :P You have to crash into EVERYTHING. Cars, Vans, Buildings, Walls. It can get repetitive but overall its a great game.

E for a reason
why is the main line have not age appropriate until 10 and iffy to 17+. I strongly beleive that kids after the age of six can crash cars. and if you look close there is no one in the cars! there is no iffy stuff for teens if im 12, awesome game!

Great for all!
It's really fun, allowing you to drive in a sandbox environment crashing into anything, which is fun you know! Even if you get slightly effected in your early years, you still have ages to learn that that's not the right thing! Did I mention the crashes are awesome?
