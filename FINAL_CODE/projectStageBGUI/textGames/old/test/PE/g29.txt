Persona 4 Golden
Love Persona 4 Golden and all the Persona and the Shin Megami Tensei games. The "Not For Kids" rating is completely unnecessary. There is NO blood there is fighting yes but absolutely no blood NO sex there is flirting and you can date a girl and you see Yukiko Chie Naoto Rise and Nanako in towels very briefly you see them in bikinis a couple of times but thats it. I am really doubting that who ever reviewed this game didn't play it much if at all the "evil creatures" as you call them are called shadows the "dream world" isn't a dream its a world inside the tv and what do you mean by "its unclear what's real and what's not" everything is real inside the tv world you should try actually playing the games before reviewing and rating them the "Not For Kids" label should be removed and this review should be redone by someone who's actually played it.

Persona 4 is for everyone!
Persona 4 has very great role models. It's also very easy to use and has some amazing messages.

Brilliant game that contains some adult themes
Persona 4 Golden is a fantastic game with some good themes of friendship and making the most out of school and childhood. The game has violent themes without much actual violence. Several murders take place but you only actually see the corpse at the end as all of the murders take place off screen but the bodies are usually hanging from tv aerials and could cause distress to younger audiences. Some sexual themes are present such as sexual identity and a strip club dungeon at one point in the game but nothing too heavy. The game also does not have much bad language. Personally if I played the game as a 12-13 year old I doubt I would of been negatively affected by the games content but this differs from person to person so please tread carefully.

Persona 4 Doesn’t deserve this rating.
It’s a good game and it is also the least dark in the whole Persona series. It features school kids solving crimes and saving other people from getting attacked in the other dimension. The story revolves around a group of friends who also partake in school activities that range from camping to skiing. The violence is also pretty low as there is no blood or gore and simply revolves around flicking a card to summon your Persona. The game (like all Persona games) is hard to master in terms of combat as there are many moves that are attacks or buffs. There is little to no sexual references and whilst you can date people there are no sexual scenes,

Some nudity (crude humor)
One case was when the team meets Teddie's human form for the first time. Due to being "born", he of course is naked (but it is covered by the bear suit) and therefore asks Chie and Yukiko if they have any clothes for him, much to the two girls' embarrassment. In the manga, this joke was reused, with Teddie's costume almost falling off. Another case was with Kanji losing his shorts at the beach, to which he covers himself in seaweed to recreate the Birth of Venus.

Not Beneficial For Families
This game contains depictions of murders / suicides that affect the characters. The "monsters" that the characters summon are actually demons from various world religions. There are many occult themes in this game disguised as Jungian psychology. The game also contains swearing and sexual themes.

A well done RPG and life sim!
The game doesn't have too much mature content unlike most games that are given an M. The violence is not too bloody and there are corpses without blood and gore. The sexual content is a bit embarrassing as there are some Personas that have questionable appearances and there is mild ecchi content as well. Swearing in the dubbed version is the same as an hard PG 13 film. The game is fine for teens and warning: The game is difficult on easy (not too much but sometimes),normal,hard, and very hard. If you aren't good at Megami Tensei games on either mentioned difficulties. Play it on very easy

 
AMAZING
When we got our switch, we got this game and animal crossing new horizons. But this game is amazing anyone can play it but there is some violence but it’s barely even to be called violence because it’s not violent but the games with violence are, battle tanks, team tanks, and shooting gallery. There is no love stuff. But if you all get the game I recommend to play this game in the game it’s called Mancala. That’s all I recommend the whole game.

Let kids play in as soon as they are physically able too
The sex is 100% hidden and all humans must know about it at some point cuz in natural. If we completely took away kids abilities to know about sex and do it we would go extinct. Put passwords on the in game purchases

Fun and Educational! Very Good.
This expansion pack is not 13+. I think that the concept of having everything your sims do impact you eco footprint is essential to the game. It is super fun, and you can catch it on sale for 20 USD (50% off). Highly Recommend.
 
A much better remaster than Warcraft 3
While the graphics and audio was polished to perfection, the gameplay and plot stays the same.

You can Fight for the Heroic GDI or the Terrorist Nod faction.

One or few of the characters in the game have a cigar/drugs in possession during the cut scenes.

The game is pretty good
It has in game economy so kids can learn how to manage money. It does have blood but that can be easily turned off. Some characters curse like Jett who says "There you are you little s-it" but that can also be turned off. Corpses are shown but it also can be turned off. The game in general is a fun fps shooter game. There are two sides, the attacking and defending. In the buy phrase they buy in-game guns using in game economy, which doesn't cost any real life money. The attackers have a bomb named the spike that they have to plant. The defenders have t defuse the spike. There are in-game gun skins that does cost real life money, but it's not must. Teammates can be rude and toxic but you can mute their mic or text chat.

Not that bad!
I think it is a lot like overwatch, if you know what that is. It’s a hero shooter we’re you pick your character and go into a game of 5v5, again much like overwatch. Lastly, the game is made by a trusted company called Riot Games, they have made many great games such as team fight tactics, league of legends, and legends of runeterra.

I’m a pc enthusiast, and when this game came out I was instantly hooked. The matches are quite long(40mins) for the standard, but the shorter matches are 10 mins (spike rush). This game is an animation, and if you let your kid watch Star Wars, they should be fine. Just tell your kid to turn their mics of since it is very annoying to hear kids screaming profanities into the chat.

Valorant is a fun, animated shooter!
Valorant is a fun shooter made for (in my opinion) ages 10 and up. The game involves animated charactors and no blood.
