Animal Crossing: New Horizons
Hey parents, do you need a game that Appropriate for all your children's ages?

Hey kids are you tired of losing to your brothers or sister at Mario kart and Mario party?

Do you need a getaway?

Then Animal Crossing: New Horizons is for you. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an amazing game with a great message and role models. By working together to make the island. It even has educational value. You're learning how to pay off loans. How much things cost. This game is enjoyable for children who know how to read. And the best part is everyone wins. There is no losing or winning. Only thing I must warn you about is that it's pretty addictive. But from that you must buy animals crossing new horizons for your children as the next nintendo switch game you buy. Also it is very kid friendly.

It looks boring but it’s so fun! And super cute!
This game is so fun! I love it! The characters are super cute (well, my villagers at least. There’s a lot of ugly ones) and it’s very fun to trade them. Trading is basically taking villagers off of your friends islands and you can get all of your favorites that way! Even without trading it’s a really fun game and it’s paced really nicely so you don’t spend too much time on it but you also want to keep playing. I don’t know when kids start to read so I rated it 4+ hoping 4 year olds can read.

Gives an Endless Experience for Normal Bursts of Time
The other main Animal Crossing games lets you live in a town, and now for this game you can make your own town. New Horizons focuses on the greater atmosphere and it even has many activities you can do.

A great game for all ages
Animal Crossing: New Horizons (or ACNH) is a great game for the whole family. In this game, you are on an island and try to make your own little town for NPC animals to join. There are tons of tools, furniture, and objects you can create. I say this game is safe for all ages because there is no death, bad language, or any inappropriate themes. So, this game is great for younger gamers. A lot of parents and adults I know enjoy ACNH, too!

Relaxing family friendly masterpiece perfect for casual play
This review's going to be a lot shorter than my others because I can't think of anything offensive in this game. Super family-friendly and really easy to play, Animal Crossing: New Horizons basically only requires time and the ability to read. Perfect for a relaxing game experience if you've been struggling with toxic online competitors or overly difficult levels in other games. Definitely worth the money. One thing that seems to upset many reviewers is the fact that all users share the same island. I personally was a bit annoyed at first, but it's a blessing in disguise. As long as your family agrees on a resident representative that is going to actually play the game to unlock features for their family members, the island being shared is actually really cool. I personally was the resident rep and grinded Tom Nook's tasks for a while, so my mom and sister had no problem catching up. I personally play the game infrequently now, but none of my villagers have left and the island is still maintained, as my mom has played nearly every day since launch. This would not be possible if it weren't for sharing an island. Family members can also all contribute their money and materials to certain projects such as bridges and housing plots due to this feature. In conclusion, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a relaxing, addictive vacation in videogame form, fun for the entire family and very easy to play.

This game will kill hours and will leave the one playing satisfied.
This game holds a special sentimental value to me because I remember playing one of the original games on the WII. I was four. This game is really great for anyone of any age who is looking to kill time and spend time with others.

This game is awesome!
This game is super fun, although it does require reading abilities to some extent, so it may not be for children under 5, but it is amazing, must buy!!

Really good!
Not everything is amazing, but it’s a great game! Also no micro transactions. The problem is that it’s too hard to find resources especially on a family shared switch.

This is quite educational and realistic
I think that this game is quite educational because it has an encyclopedia for butterflies, fish and yes, even tarantulas and scorpions.

These dreadful devils attack you if you get close to them at night and they can spawn quite commonly and do so in unexpected places. They chase you with speed and if you don't go inside in time, or if you don't catch them, you get attacked and faint. This happens with bees, except the first time you get stung, you get bruises and the next time, you faint.

Users can interact and say many things, so careful if you hang out with strangers.

The bugs in this game can give you the creeps. I think that they are a bit too realistic for a PEGI 3 game and I don't know why I would be proud if I caught a live beetle and if I hold it in my hands whilst it wiggles its legs around.

However, this realistic game can help you learn about how you can make profits, different animals, large numbers (if a young kid were to play it) and how life works a bit more.

I would probably bump this up to a PEGI 7/ E for everyone 10 and up because it can be quite violent and unpredictable. The first time I saw a tarantula, I freaked out.

Best game for kids and families
The specific reason I gave this game an 7+ rating was that I got New Leaf in when I was 7. I completely understood it and was glued to my DS for hours upon hours. But is that the case for New Horizons?

The answer my friend is YES! New Horizons has the same charm as New Leaf and is even better in my opinion. The Switch’s comparability makes it available to play on the TV, and you can play with other users (don’t worry parents, this is hidden behind a paywall so your child won’t be able to access it freely).

I’m not going to spoil the game but I am going to say it’s great and if you’re thinking about buying it, DO IT!!

That’s all folks!

SO AMAZING
This is one of the BEST GAMES EVER. This is a game were you get to build and make your own island!!! It teaches kids about saving up money because you have to save enough money to pay your bills. You also have to use creativity. This is a amazing game that teaches life skills and you decide were the game goes.

REALLY fun game!
This game is good for ages 5 and up. There is no violence whatsoever, and it is very cute and somewhat stress relieving to not have something that is violent or real-life. It is based off of real time, so if it is 5:30 at your house, it will be 5:30 in Animal Crossing. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played yet.

Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game to play during Coronavirus
As long as you have a Nintendo switch then you ca play! It’s a great game for everyone weather your playing with yourself or with friends. You need bells and Nook miles to pay for items and clothes. They are a bit overpriced. But overall it’s a great game!

Great game!
Animal Crossing charms me in many ways. It teaches us kids about the wonders of nature. It's also very easy to get your hands on. It gets better when days pass. The villagers are really friendly and helpful. Some of my friends even help me get rid of these pesky weeds! Great game and gave it 5 stars for obvious reasons.
