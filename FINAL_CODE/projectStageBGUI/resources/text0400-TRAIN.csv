Leloup D. Dumas CRT Normandie — Mont-Saint-Michel and an unmistakeable silhouette you would know among a thousand others. For 13 centuries this rocky island nestling in the heart of a huge beautiful bay has been home to a magnificent abbey. Perched at the top of the islet as if levitating the building is like a mirage always a mesmerising sight. An architectural miracle © Sabina Lorkin Anibas Photography - CRT Normandie The builders of the Middle Ages surpassed themselves despite the many challenges of the rugged terrain on the island. First around the year 1000 a pre-Romanesque church was built then in the eleventh century a Romanesque abbey and in the thirteenth century a sublime Gothic elevation known as the Merveille the Wonder. Comprised of two buildings of three floors as if by a miracle it perches on the slope of the rock crowned by a cloister and large refectory. From the west forecourt the view over the bay is simply breath taking. An angel in the sky Une publication partagée par Montsaintmichel_normandie @montsaintmichel_normandie le 21 Avril 2018 à 2 04 PDT Weighing 820 kilos measuring 3.5 meters the slayer of the dragon of the Apocalypse perches at the tip of the abbeys spire 156 meters above sea level. Dethroned restored and redeemed in 2016 the Archangel Saint-Michel returned to the summit of Mont-Saint-Michel like a star... in a helicopter. Island prospects Une publication partagée par Montsaintmichel_normandie @montsaintmichel_normandie le 11 Janv. 2017 à 1 37 PST The Benedictine monks of the Middle Ages chose Mont Tombe as it was known for its incomparable location at the base of a bay besieged by the ocean depending on the tides. But a gradual build up of silt challenged its future as an island. 10 years of gargantuan work has been undertaken begun in 2005 and the construction of a dam which you can visit was essential to preserve its maritime character as home to one of the most extraordinary religious buildings in the world. A unique show Une publication partagée par Montsaintmichel_normandie @montsaintmichel_normandie le 7 Avril 2018 à 2 02 PDT The Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel experiences the largest tides in continental Europe an astonishing 15 metres of tidal range may take place. As soon as the tidal coefficient exceeds 110 Mont-Saint-Michel becomes an island for a few hours providing a unique and glorious show. The water covers the submersible ford cutting off the mainland and creating the impression the island is floating. But don’t worry thanks to a bridge providing a gateway you can reach the site even during the high tides. Storming the quicksand Une publication partagée par Montsaintmichel_normandie @montsaintmichel_normandie le 25 Mai 2018 à 7 07 PDT Walk barefoot on the sand and along the streams and canals of seawater to reach the Merveille... Crossing the bay in the footsteps of the ancient pilgrims of the Middle Ages is a memorable experience. And it’s a great chance to learn from a guide of the legends and secrets of this special place with its unique ecosystem. Lamb with an ocean flavour Une publication partagée par Montsaintmichel_normandie @montsaintmichel_normandie le 2 Mars 2017 à 1 00 PST It’s said that the local grass irrigated with sea water rich in salt and minerals gives a unique taste to the lambs raised on the pastures of Mont-Saint-Michel bay. These grazers of salt meadows are famous for their incomparable flavour earning them the famed label of AOC. There’s no better way to savour the end of a wonderful day climbing the Mont than with a gastronomic meal.

The museum located in Compiègne in Northern France is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Great War Armistice to renew its visitors tour. Now is the perfect opportunity to rediscover this historic site and learn more about the armistices of the two World Wars. Live the signature of the armistice © Malice Images — The memorial presents a replica of the wagon in which the armistice was signed. It is November 11 1918 515 am. The day has hardly dawned on the Clairière de Rethondes where a dead calm reigns.

This particular atmosphere is retranscribed at the memorial where you can visit a replica of the most famous train car in history. Original furnitures inkwells desk lamps phones - all the period details immerse the visitor in the heart of this historic moment. Understanding the links between the two World Wars © Malice Images — The new course of the memorial consists of 10 sequences. The Glade of Rethondes is also the setting for Frances capitulation in 1940. After the signing the glade was destroyed by order of Hitler. The memorials of the Great War and the car of the armistice are transported to Germany where it was destroyed by fire. The world had to wait for the end of the Second World War for the monuments to return to the glade where they belonged. The new memorial tour divided into ten sequences from 1914 to the after 1944 lead visitors from one war to another allowing them to see the link between these two armistices. Tread on the Armistice Glade © X. Renoux/OT — The Ring of Peace is one of the monuments that make up the Armistice Glade.

This southern seaside town is set on a small rocky peninsula that is 500 meters long and 300 meters wide. The climate is particularly well-suited for summer tourism – many long summer days cooled by the breezes from the mountains of Strandzha. The city’s average July temperature is 22-23 degrees Centigrade. Ahtopol is an ancient city – many anchors have been found in the city’s aqueducts that attest to the seafaring activities of the peninsula’s residents over various historical periods. Such finds as a stone axe and fragments of pottery are evidence that Ahtopol was inhabited during the Late Stone Age and Early Bronze Age. There are also Thracian artifacts from the Bronze Age. Near the end of the 5th century BCE there was a colony here called Agatopolis from the Greek compound agathos” good” and polis” city”. Ahtopol is mentioned in records of the uprising against the Byzantine Empire in 1185 led by the boyars Asen and Peter. The city was overrun by the Ottomans in 1396. A fire completely destroyed Ahtopol in 1918. After the disaster only the Ascension of the Lord Church survived. The church was constructed in 1796 and is now part of the Saint Yana Saint Ivan The Precursor Monastery Complex. So for all intents and purposes Ahtopol was rebuilt from the ground up after the fire. Today Ahtopol is a small seaside city with an excellent beach pleasant restaurants and comfortable hotels. Possibilities for accommodations are many and varied from hotels to rooms in pensions to bungalow complexes. Ahtopol is far from a huge seaside resort and that is one of the things that make it attractive to tourists who prefer some peace and quiet. The days at the beach can be enlivened by mountain excursions in The Strandzha Nature Park which is in close proximity to the city. There are many walking trails of varying lengths and difficulty. There are a number of other small seaside resorts within an hour’s drive of Ahtopol such as Tsarevo Lozenets Varvara Sinemorets and the southernmost point on Bulgaria’s Black Sea Coast Rezova.

Balchik is situated on the seashore in a region with a moderate continental climate. The average temperature in July is 22 degrees Celsius and the temperature of the seawater during the summer reaches 24 degrees Celsius. The town was established 26 centuries ago by Greek settlers named Krunes. In the 6th century BC the town was named after the Greek God of wine and joy – Dionysus – Dionisiopolis. In the 4th century BC Dionisiopolis was a very important economical center. That is evident by the found coins which had been coined in the town. The name of the God Dionysus was carved on them. The cults for the God of Wine and the Great Mother Goddess Kibela were largely spread. In the 1st century AD the town became a part of the Roman Empire and it reached its greatest prosperity in the 2nd – 3rd century. After the dividing of the Roman Empire in 395 the proximity of Constantinople – the capital of the East Roman Empire had a significant influence upon the development of the town. Then the settlement turned into an important administrative and port center. In 544 – 545 the town was demolished by a powerful earthquake that caused high tidal waves. The residents who survived moved and started building their settlement anew at the place of today’s residential section of Horizont in Balchik. In the early Middle Ages the town was one of the regional centers of the Bulgarian Empire. At the end of the 14th century Dobrudzha was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and at the end of the 16th century the town was already named Balchik. Balchik was liberated from the Ottoman Dominion on 31 January 1878. At the beginning of the 20th century here was constructed the largest mill on the Balkan Peninsula. Near 70 000 tones of grain had been exported from the town and more than 500 ships had been used for this purpose. The grain travelled to England Belgium Germany Denmark etc. The district of South Dobrudzha in which Balchik is situated was annexed in 1917 at the end of the Second Balkan War and this way Silistra Tutrakan Dobrich Balchik and Kavarna remained outside the borders of Bulgaria. As of 7 September 1940 South Dobrudzha was returned to Bulgaria. The greatest landmark of Balchik – the Palace – has remained from the period of the Romanian occupation. The Palace was the former summer residence of the Romanian Queen Maria Alexandrina Victoria De Edinburgh 1875 – 1938. The residence was constructed in 1924. The Botanical Garden – another great landmark of the town – is also situated within the borders of the residence. A large number of the finds made during excavations in the region are stored in the Historical Museum of Balchik. The exponents speak of the creation and the development of the town in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The period in which Balchik and South Dobrudzha were under Romanian rule is presented by pictures and documents. All finds and marble statues from the Kibela Temple are stored in the museum. The Temple of Kibela was found in 2007 and according to archaeologists it dates back to about 280 – 260 years BC. 27 preserved inscriptions were found in the remains of the temple and almost all images are of the Goddess Kibela. After the earthquake in the middle of the 6th century the temple was covered up. Nowadays it is accessible without paying an admission fee. On the request of the tourists a curator of the Historical Museum can tell about the history of the temple on site. During visiting the site be careful because it has not been maintained and is situated at the bottom of a deep ditch. The building of the Ethnographic Museum is situated opposite to the building of the Historical Museum. The museum is housed in a house from the Period of Revival which was ownership of a tradesperson from Balchik. Domestic articles jewels and traditional clothes are presented here. A special place is made to crafts such as copper making homespun tailoring etc. Traditional costumes from Dobrudzha and Kotel can be seen on the second floor of the museum as well as interesting tools such as carding machines devices for wool combing distaff looms etc. Tourists can learn more about the development of Balchik during the Revival 18th – 19th century in the Mutual School and the church St. Nikolas which are a symbol of the struggle of the local population for their own church and education. The two sites are united under the name Revival Complex. In the school the tourists can see what the classroom and the teacher’s office had looked like in the period 1861 – 1865. In the classroom one can see the school desks of the youngest students – sandpits” then the school desks for writing on marble slabs and the desks behind them had been for the most advanced students who were writing on parchment sheets. The Art gallery is also an interesting place for a visit. After the returning of South Dobdudzha to Bulgaria in 1940 the gallery was closed and the exponents were taken to Romania. Restoration of the cultural institution began in the 1960s. Nowadays works of art created by multiple Bulgarian authors are exhibited on an area of 800 square meters. There are a foreign art hall and other two halls which accommodate temporary exhibitions on its first floor. A central place in the foyer of the second floor is occupied by the statue of God Dionysus. Here is the permanent exposition of the gallery. There are more than 1500 works of art made by Bulgarian and foreign authors in the gallery fund. The sea resort of Albena is situated in close proximity to Balchik. The two destinations are connected by a seashore alley called Dambata. It begins from the yacht port passes by the Palace and reaches Albena as its total length is 7300 meters. The Monastery Ak Yazala Baba – St. Atanas is situated at 16 km from Balchik near the village of Obrochishte. The local people call it the Tekke a dervish monastery. It was built in the 16th century but it was visited by Christians and Muslims as well. The Muslims consider a patron of the monastery the Muslim saint Akyazala Baba. After his death the dervishes built a Tekke around which the village of Tekiedzhik today’s village of Obrochishte was built. In this place the Christians honor St. Atanasius the Great. They believe that there was a monastery here once which was turned by the Muslims into a dervish sanctuary and St. Atanasius was murdered by the Ottomans while he was defending his faith. Nowadays visitors can see two buildings – the türbe tomb in the middle of which is the grave of Akyazala Baba and the imaret – the place where the monks were performing their rituals and had accommodated travelers. The buildings have similar architecture – a construction of seven walls with a rectangular anteroom stuck to one of its walls. The imaret roof was demolished during the war between Russia and Turkey in 1768 – 1774. There are three modern golf courses in close proximity to Balchik. There are also other interesting places in the region – the village of Kranevo the rock capital of Bulgaria – the town of Kavarna as well as many camping sites. The reservation of the Kaliakra fortress is also near. Balchik and the region around it offer diverse accommodation catering and entertainment options. There is no doubt however that Balchik is most popular for its possibilities for sea tourism. The beautiful beaches in the region around the town as well as the fresh nature attract many tourists in the summer months. Information materials about the cultural sites and Balchik are sold in all museums and the gallery. ﻿Opening hours Historical Museum Ethnographic Museum Revival Complex Art Gallery and Akyazala Baba Monastery work with the following opening hours June – September from Monday to Sunday 09.00 am – 5.00 pm on Sunday – upon a preliminary request October – May from Monday to Friday 07.30 am – 4.30 pm Saturday and Sunday – days-off Admission Adults – BGN 5 per site Groups of adults more than 10 people – BGN 3 per person Children under 7-year old – BGN 1 Guided tours in Bulgarian and Russian language Thematic lecture – BGN 5 per lecture General lecture – BGN 2 Contacts Municipality of Balchik town of Balchik 21 September Square Tel +359 579 71 034 Tel +359 579 722 42 e-mail email protected Website www.balchik.bg Historical Museum town of Balchik 2 Dimitar Zhelev Str Tel +359 579 72 177 e-mail email protected Website http//www.balchik.bg/bg/infopage/77-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8 Ethnographic Museum town of Balchik 3 Dimitar Zhelev Str Tel +359 579 72 177 e-mail email protected Website http//www.balchik.bg/bg/infopage/77-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8 Revival Complex town of Balchik 4 Hristo Botev Str Tel +359 579 72 177 e-mail email protected Website http//www.balchik.bg/bg/infopage/77-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8 Art Gallery town of Balchik 4 Otets Paisiy Str Tel +359 579 72 177 e-mail email protected Website http//www.balchik.bg/bg/infopage/77-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8 Akyazala Baba Monastery in the region of the village of Obrochishte Tel +359 579 72 177 e-mail email protected Website http//www.balchik.bg/bg/infopage/77-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8 The museum curators in Balchik guide the tourists in Bulgarian and Russian language. ﻿TOURIST INFORMATION CENTER – BALCHIK Contacts Tel/fax +359 579 76961 e-mail email protected e-mail email protected 25 A Primorska Str. town of Balchik 9600 Services 1.

It is close to another big Bulgarian resort – Slanchev bryag Sunny Beach. Nesebar Region has a temperate continental climate. The average temperature in the month of July is +23.1°C and +2°C in January. The month with most precipitation is September. July and August are characterised by dry weather. The town was established more than 3200 years ago. Thracians settled there at the end of the Bronze Age. They called it Melsambria which meant the town of Melsas – that was probably the name of the founder of the settlement. They were succeeded by the Dorians ancient Greek tribe who came to the town at the end of the 6th century BC. Under their control the settlement expanded a fortification wall was built residential quarters emerged etc. At the beginning of the 1st century AD the town became part of the Roman Empire. It was then when they started calling it Mesembria. The town continued to be an important economic and cultural centre. After the capital of the Roman Empire moved to Constantinople and Christianity became the official religion there was a building boom of Christian temples on the territory of Mesembria. The town became part of the First Bulgarian Empire in 812 when Bulgarian ruler Khan Krum conquered it. The Slavs who settled there started calling it Nesebar. The town played a crucial role during the reigns of Tsars Kings Kaloyan 1197-1207 Ivan Asen II 1218 – 1241 and Konstantine Tikh 1257-1277. The town flourished under the rule of Tsar Ivan Alexander 1331 – 1371 – many new churches were built culture and religion developed. Nesebar was conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Today the old and the new part of the town are connected by a narrow isthmus. The old town lies on a small peninsula. Because of its exceptional cultural and historical value Nesebar was declared a museum tourist and resort complex of international importance by virtue of Ordinance No 243 of the Council of Ministers of 18 July 1956. In 1983 Old Nesebar was included in the List of World Cultural Heritage Sites of UNESCO. Tourists can get more information about the history and the development of the town at the Archaeological Museum which is located at the very beginning of the peninsula. It exhibits finds discovered during archaeological excavations. The traces of past historical periods are everywhere. Part of the fortification wall can be seen in the Old Town. It was declared an architectural-construction monument of culture of national importance by virtue of publication in State Gazette issue No 41 of 1964. A number of churches have been preserved and two of them – St. Spas Church and S. Stefan Church have been transformed into museums. Many of the houses in the Old Town were built during the Bulgarian Revival Period 18th – 19th centuries. The architectural design of Moskoyani House where the exhibition of the Ethnographic Museum of Nesebar is housed is interesting. Visitors can learn many things about the life and the culture of the people of Nesebar. Various everyday objects and traditional costumes are displayed there. Various events and concerts are held at the ancient theatre in Old Nesebar in the summer. Behind it lies the Nesebar Port where during the active summer season one can often see cruise ships that have stopped by the UNESCO town. Visitors who want to capture the spirit of the town can stay in Old Nesebar – there are many accommodation opportunities that vary in type and price – family hotels private rental rooms etc. There are numerous restaurants in the vicinity that serve delicious seafood. Apart from the fact that it functions as a connection between the old and the new parts of the town the isthmus is also a preferred place for strolls of the guests and the citizens of Nesebar. There are pedestrian alleys on both sides of the isthmus close to the sea. The wind-mill that stands in the middle of the isthmus is another symbol of the town. The new part of Nesebar also offers various accommodation opportunities. The buildings of the town administration and many institutions are situated there. The north and the south beaches of Nesebar lie in the new part of the town. There is a beach in Old Nesebar but it is a small one.

I wouldnt be comfortable punting with a young child a trip to the pub isnt the same with kids Bodleian is a working library so welcomes over 11 year olds only and family walking tours are aimed at children aged 8 and over. So is Oxford a good destination for young families? Absolutely! I took my 5-year-old daughter to Oxford to see what she enjoyed. Oxford is included in Britains Heritage Cities which encourages me to take even more UK trips throughout the year. Id also recommend checking the Visit Oxfordshire site or going to the Visitor Centre on Broad Street as staff are full of ideas to help you enjoy your time in the city. City Sightseeing Oxford is a hop on hop off bus service and the full circular route takes about an hour including stops at the train and bus stations. This allowed me to still see all the key locations without lots of walking as the audio tour kept my daughter entertained while I enjoyed the views. Incredibly Oxford Castle was Oxfords Prison right up to 1996. The whole site has been redeveloped for public use and the visitor attraction Oxford Castle Unlocked tells the tale of its long and gruesome history so is great for fans of Horrible Histories. Costumed guides take you on a tour of the Saxon St Georges Tower and down to the 900-year-old crypt before you explore the prison cells. The climb up is for over 5 year olds and we found the 101 steep steps on the narrow staircase manageable as theres a break halfway in a prison room to see exhibits and hear more tales. Plus the views from the top are fantastic and make the climb worthwhile. Youll need refreshments after your visit and Cafe 1071 is right next to the entrance and is a good choice for families. The chocolate fudge cake is recommended. The redevelopment of the Oxford Castle complex includes the stunning Malmaison Oxford boutique hotel where some of the rooms are converted prison cells! Even if you dont stay in a cell do ask to see the preserved cell near Reception. When the prison closed it was used as a film and TV location including for Inspector Morse another big draw for the city. Theres a joke that there should be a plaque on the buildings in Oxford that havent been used for Morse! Brad Pitt and Glenn Close have also filmed here. Heading for Pitt Rivers Museum we went in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and had been there for over an hour before we realised we were in the wrong place. Upon returning the next day we found out you enter Pitt Rivers through the Museum of Natural History so its an easy mistake to make. Both museums are great for kids and have family activities every Sunday afternoon as well as trails available every day. Plus theyre free to visit seven days a week. In Pitt Rivers we found the infamous shrunken heads and borrowed a torch to do the Mouse Trail which is clever way of encouraging visitors to look more closely at the display cases. Gallery staff are fantastic with young children and helped us with the trail but also pointed out curiosities like the worlds smallest doll and a warrior helmet made from a porcupine fish. Theres an Egyptian mummy here too but youll find a lot more in the Ashmolean. As a Londoner Ill always draw comparisons the Ashmolean is like the British Museum and I felt Pitt Rivers is like the Horniman Museum although it has a lot more exhibits. The Natural History Museum is clearly like Londons Natural History Museum with its dinosaur skeletons. We really liked the Please Touch sign on the cheetah and the magnifying glasses that made tiny bugs seem enormous! Oxford is great for fans of Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland and a trip to Christ Church will appeal to young children as long as you sell it to them the right way. Time your trip well as this is a popular attraction but also a working college so access to the Great Hall is not available at meal times as it is used every day. As you climb the steps to enter the Great Hall act out the scene together from the first Harry Potter film where Professor McGonagall greets the new students to Hogwarts. Inside the Great Hall youll feel like youve entered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but see if you can work out why this couldnt be the film location. Clue count the dining tables and think of the number of houses at Hogwarts. The real Alice was the College Deans daughter and Charles Dodgson aka Lewis Carroll studied taught and lived at Christ Church. There are clues to his inspiration in the room including the brass firedogs with their long necks. Also look for the Alice window 5th window on the left. Christ Church Cathedral has a family Head Hunt trail to encourage young visitors to look more closely at this beautiful church. While exploring do look at the stained glass windows near the St Frideswade memorial and in the bottom right window youll see the only image of a toilet in stained glass in any church in the UK! Next Time I definitely want to go back to Oxford and next time I want to see the Museum of the History of Science as it has Charles Dodgsons camera and Einsteins blackboard plus its free to visit. I plan to dine at the Nosebag as so many people have recommended it and well have lardy cake from the Covered Market where The Cake Shop has fantastic window displays. I plan to visit Blackwells Bookshop on Broad Street and get to at least one historic pub. The Mitre on the High Street looks like a good choice as its Oxfords oldest inn and was once owned and managed by the real Alice in Wonderlands former governess. Id also like to partake of afternoon tea at Macdonald Randolph Hotel. And all this before I try an Alice in Wonderland river cruise or head out of town to Blenheim Palace which will entertain my daughter too with the Adventure Play Area the miniature train maze and butterfly house and well continue our Great British Playground Tour. I wonder if shell let me see inside the palace too? Special thanks to Visit Oxfordshire and Britains Heritage Cities who organised our trip. We received free admission at Oxford Castle Unlocked Christ Church College and tickets for the City Sightseeing bus. Our stay was hosted by The Oxford Malmaison.

5ee8a97c2daef1fe6a923a81,https://www.france.fr/en/northern-france/article/top-5-favorite-restaurants-for-locals-lille,Happening now in France Places to go Things to do Plan your trip Search on France.fr Proposed by Places to go / Northern France / Top 5 favorite restaurants for locals Lille Published 10 December 2018 1555 Under an hour from the Belgian border Lille reflects its Flemish neighbors through culture and cuisine. It’s a global hub in part due to its geo-locale but also for a notable contingent of international students. Named European Capital of Culture in 2004 it now has a TGV line that has made the major northern city more easily accessible. This lively student town boasts all the charming details of Belgian and French architecture as well as the cuisine important to both countries. A strong microbrew culture is also of note—be sure to ask about the artisanal beers at these locally loved restaurants. La Bellezza External link Big Mama Group which has taken Paris by storm with its authentically Italian bistro flair recently opened a restaurant in Lille. La Bellezza as its name would suggest doesn’t sacrifice décor to focus on its homemade dishes which include both locally sourced ingredients and Italian imports. Try the pasta and the tiramisu. The cocktails are a hit amongst the locals too. Big Mama restaurants are known for their friendly ambiance. From the chefs in the open kitchen to the bar staff—they’ll put on a show for you. Watch this video External link to catch the behind-the-scenes vibe that Big Mama restaurants are known for. Le Bloempot External link This Flanders-inspired restaurant puts a blind trust in nature’s ingredients as well as its suppliers so much so that they even call their evening prix fixe les yeux fermés which literally means eyes closed.” And that faith in what nature brings has given chef Florent Ladeyn quite a bit of notoriety. Top Chef finalist in 2013 his loss certainly didn’t slow him down. He opened Le Bloempot and also won a Michelin star for his family restaurant Auberge du Vert Mont in a commune just outside of Lille. Both restaurants are truly a locavore’s delight. Rouge-Barre External link Steven Ramon is yet another Top Chef star who may not have won but certainly succeeded in the long run when he opened his restaurant in Lille. He’s a self-professed hard worker who understands what it takes to create a truly pleasurable meal. His local pride is clear—he refuses to leave his home in the northern countryside has spent a lot of time working on local farms and is excited at the chance to elevate the image of Lillois cuisine. Octopus External link After significant training under chefs Benoit Bernard and Steven Ramon Chef Nicolas Choquet opened his first restaurant earlier this year and has received numerous accolades. His partner in crime is his wife Stephanie who crafts the wine menu and is responsible for the excellent service reviews as she runs the front of the house. Seasonal organic ingredients make up the menu which changes every two weeks. Every one of Choquet’s plates makes for a colorful rustic arrangement. Babe External link This hotspot is known for guilt-free gluttony in total transparency figuratively and literally their windowed storeroom displays aged meats charcuterie cheeses and an excellent local and exotic beer selection. This restaurant is for open-minded folks looking for all that’s fun and feisty. Just read how the restaurant describes itself Babe is like your lover—rough and seductive.” For more information Lilles 6 best restaurants Prepare your stay in Lille External link Events 6 Dec Lille World Design Capital in 2020 Until December 31 8 Oct Lyon Street Food Festival Until October 11 More events DESTINATIONS Discover Hauts-de-France More ideas Northern France Cuisine Something for two Being a culture vulture Living like royalty Related articles A stone’s throw from the museum Dig deep into learning at the Louvre-Lens!

5ee8a97c2daef1fe6a923a87,https://www.france.fr/en/lyon/list/bugnes-anne-sophie-vidal-fashion-cooking,Happening now in France Places to go Things to do Plan your trip Search on France.fr Proposed by Places to go / Lyon / Bugnes by Anne-Sophie Vidal of ‘Fashion Cooking’ By Pascale Filliâtre  Published 19 April 2020 0500 © M.studio / Adobe Stock — Each region has its own take on carnival doughnuts In France we really like desserts. And they’re even more cause for celebration when the whole family rolls up their sleeves and gets involved. Some crazy food bloggers are inviting you to take the kids into the kitchen and test out some of their sweet recipes – and following the clafoutis this week it’s bugnes a special form of doughnut. Delicious! Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partagée par #fashioncooking @annesophie.vidal le 25 Févr. 2020 à 7 43 PST All regions and families in France have a recipe for bugnes each with its own name ‘Merveilles’ in Bordeaux ‘Pets de Nonnes’ in Champagne ‘Bottereaux’ in Nantes and Brittany and ‘Frappe’ in Corsica. Around Lyon and in Auvergne the local bugnes herald the annual Carnival – but there’s nothing to stop you making and eating them all year round! Try this recipe by Anne-Sophie Vidal winner of TV show Le Meilleur Pâtissier. They can be crunchy or fluffy the question is whether to add yeast or not. Ingredients for around 40 crunchy or 25 soft bugnes 250g 2 cups multi-purpose flour ½ packet baking powder 6g 1 tbsp only add for soft bugnes 2 whole eggs 50g 1/4 cup soft butter 75g 1/3 cup sugar 2 pinches salt 2 tbsp rum Icing sugar for dusting Method In a bowl form a well in the flour and baking powder if you’re making fluffy bugnes. Add the beaten eggs and mix vigorously then add the rest of the ingredients and mix. Knead the dough well by hand then wrap it in cling film and let it rest for a few hours if this rest exceeds six hours put the dough in the fridge and remove it 10 minutes before using. If you’re making fluffy bugnes use a large airtight box instead of cling film as the dough will swell a little. For crunchy bugnes On a floured board using a rolling pin roll out the dough very thinly to 2mm. Don’t hesitate to use plenty of flour as the dough can be very sticky. Cut out rectangles of dough roughly 4x8cm with a wheel or pizza cutter. Make two lines in each rectangle. For fluffy bugnes On a floured board using a rolling pin roll out the dough to 5-6mm. Don’t hesitate to add flour as the dough can be very sticky. Cut fairly narrow diamonds of dough roughly 4x12cm diagonally with a wheel or pizza cutter. Make one line lengthwise in the centre of each diamond. Heat some frying oil in a deep pan. When it’s hot enough test by dropping a small piece of dough into it it should form bubbles and quickly float to the surface brown the bugnes in batches of five depending on the size of your pan for around two minutes turning them over after one. They should be barely browned for crunchy and golden for fluffy. Drain them on paper towels. After allowing them to cool for 15 minutes dust with icing sugar on both sides essential. Enjoy them lukewarm or cold with tea or coffee. Both types of bugnes keep for at least a week in an airtight container.

We look at the different options for extending your travels upwards to the bonnie Highlands. 1. By train Scotland is well-connected with London thanks to the UK’s excellent extensive rail network. For example the train journey from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh can take as little as 4 hours 20 minutes and cost as low as £40 one way if you book in advance. Regular rail services also run to Glasgow 4hrs 30mins Dundee 5hrs 50mins Aberdeen 7hrs Inverness 8hrs with connections to regional stops too. Useful websites for booking train tickets to Scotland Buy as far in advance as you can to get the best prices - use websites like The Trainline or direct with the rail operators for this route Virgin Trains and East Coast. Rail passes A BritRail GB Pass offers unlimited rail travel on any train service in Britain. A flexible version is also available. 2. By sleeper train Yes that’s right – there is a way to travel in the UK where in the evening hub-bub of London you can board a train wine and dine in a sedate lounge car that echoes of yesteryear before retiring to your cosy compartment for a restorative night’s sleep. You wake up the next morning with a cup of tea brought by your steward then look out the window to see you’re in the Highlands with deer running beside the track. The Caledonian Sleeper train runs from London Euston to the heart of Scotland every night of the week apart from Saturdays and there are reclining seats for a cheaper alternative to the compartments. A most civilised way to travel! The sleeper train takes 13 hours from London Euston to Fort William – a great spot from which to explore the Highlands. There are also services to Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and Aberdeen. Useful websites for planning your snooze cruise See the Caledonian Sleeper website also read London to Scotland by sleeper by the Man in Seat 61. You can also book tickets on the National Rail website and The Trainline as well as at any railway station in Britain. 3. By car Maybe the more laborious option but you’ll have the freedom to stop where you like and could break up the journey taking in some other amazing areas of the UK. The Lake District serves as a perfect mid-way stopping point and will warm you up for the mountains of Scotland. This could also work out as the cheaper of the options if you share the journey with others and split the cost of fuel. The drive from central London to Glasgow takes around 7hrs to Edinburgh around 7hrs 30mins and to Inverness around 10hrs 30mins. 4. By coach National Express runs from London Victoria Coach Station regularly throughout the day with journey times of 8hrs 15mins to Glasgow 9hrs to Edinburgh and 12hrs 35mins to Inverness. Budget provider Megabus operates routes to Aberdeen Dundee Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and Perth and also offers a sleeper coach with beds on the Glasgow route. 5. By plane Possibly the quickest – and often cheapest – option though remember to take into account any travel to and from the airport additional luggage charges and so on. Budget airline easyJet has regular daily flights leave from London’s Gatwick and Luton airports to Glasgow Inverness Aberdeen and Edinburgh and from London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow. British Airways has regular daily flights leave from London’s Gatwick Heathrow and City airports to Glasgow and Edinburgh and from London’s Heathrow and City airports to Aberdeen. 6. By foot... Maybe not such an easy way...it would take 115 hours to walk the 403 miles 650km from London to Glasgow – without a break… Find out more about travelling around Britain by bus train or car.

Homemade afternoon tea A staple of British tradition afternoon tea is a quaint way to spend some much-needed alone time with your other half - but depending on where you go even the pot of tea itself can be expensive. Try impressing your other half from the comfort of your own home by whipping up a homemade afternoon tea spread.

This way you can both indulge in your delicious homemade baking without being left with a pricey bill at the end! 2. Long beach walks Britain is blessed with some of the world’s most picturesque coastlines meaning you needn’t cross oceans to enjoy a barefoot stroll along a sandy beach. From the elusive coves of Cornwall to Northumberland’s unspoilt coastal stretch you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to a seaside timeout for two.

Cultural museum visits From Newcastle’s Laing Art Gallery to London’s Imperial War Museum there are a huge number of free cultural hotspots scattered throughout Britain. If you’re a fan of art a history lover or just fancy checking out the latest exhibitions a visit to any of the UK’s museums won’t disappoint. Whether it’s the first date or the fifth culture and romance go hand-in-hand - as well as offering a perfect opportunity for you to get to know each other a little better. 4. Picnics by sunset The warmer weather might still be a while off but with the sun setting earlier in the colder months it’s the perfect excuse to wrap up warm and head outdoors. Whether you’re finishing an evening stroll with a coffee in the park or watching as the sun sets over the city make the most of your evenings by spending more time outside. For some time away from the hustle and bustle of modern life nothing says romance like your very own private sunset viewing. 5.

The population of the town is around 14 000 people. E87 main road connecting the northern and the southern parts of the Black Sea Coast passes through Pomorie. Varna Burgas Sozopol and Nesebar can be reached via Pomorie Port. The town lies in close proximity to the international airport of Burgas. Pomorie is one of the most popular destinations in summer– the average air and water temperature in July is 23.6°С there are up to 2 360 hours of sunshine every year and the beach is about 5 km long. Winters are mild and with minimum precipitation. Moreover the region has been famous for the medicinal qualities of the mud extracted during the production of salt in Pomorie Lake ever since ancient times. The healing powers of the mineral water in the town are also well-known. The slow cooling of the seawater is very typical for the region. In the morning before sunrise the air is rich in ozone negative ions ultraviolet rays and iodine released in gas form by seaweed. The earliest evidence of human activity found in Pomorie dates back to the Neolithic Age 6th millennium BC. There are also traces from the Chalcolithic Age 5th millennium BC the Bronze Age 3rd – 2nd millennium BC and the Iron Age end of the 2nd millennium BC. In the 2nd century BC Pomorie was named Anchialus. In 45 Anchialus became part of the Roman Empire. The town expanded during the 2nd century when it was moved to a new place in Paleocastro Area. The period during which Anchialus was part of the Roman Empire was marked by powerful progress. The economic and political development of the town was proven by the fact that it started to mint coins. The nymph cult was extremely widespread during this period. According to local people the so-called Anchialic nymphs were three girls who inhabited the mountains the forests and the rivers. They were regarded as goddesses – protectors of springs. This cult was related to the nearby Aqua Kalide mineral springs – the modern-day Burgas mineral baths which were called Anchialus baths. The town was visited personally by the rulers of the Roman Empire as great celebrations were held on 28 October 294 in honour of the visit of Emperor Diocletian. The town retained its strategic position in the Middle Ages. Oftentimes its region became a scene of violent battles between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines and the control over the town switched many times from one camp to the other. In 1453 Anchialus was conquered by the Ottomans. During the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century the coastal town functioned as an administrative centre. The town was liberated from the Ottoman rule on 7 February 1878. Anchialus continued to develop after the Liberation – the local people engaged in vine-growing wine production fishing salt production etc. The production of salt has always been very important for the Pomorie Region. Fishing also plays a significant part in the livelihood of people and the economy of the town. Crafts and trade by sea were developed predominantly. In 1934 Anchialus was renamed to Pomorie. A considerable part of the finds discovered during archaeological digs in the region can be seen at Pomorie History Museum. The archaeological exhibition is spread around several halls. The main part of the finds is displayed in the Prehistory Hall. They date back to the Chalcolithic Age 5th millennium BC and were discovered in Kozareva Settlement Mound. Many of the items exhibited in the Antiquity Hall were found on the bottom of the sea while the Roman and medieval town of Anchialus is represented by artefacts discovered during excavations in Paleocastro Area. There is a special museum hall devoted to coins. The oldest exhibits displayed in the Numismatics Hall are from Greek coastal poleis coins of Thracian and Macedon kings 5th – 1st centuries BC. Central spot is given to the bronze coins minted in Anchialus during the Roman Age and to medieval Bulgarian coins. On the second floor visitors can see the traditional arrangement of an urban home in Anchialus – drawing-room bedroom and various objects. Traditional costumes and female adornments typical of the ethnographic groups in the region are displayed there. The Bulgarian history in the period 1878 – present day is illustrated in two other sections of the museum by a rich collection of photographs and documents. The Museum of Salt that follows the development of the salt production industry which has played an important role in the town and the region both in the past and in the present opened doors on the shore of Pomorie Lake in 2002. This is the only place in Bulgaria where salt-mines using ancient salt production technologies continue to operate. Pomorian lye used for the treatment of skeletal and skin diseases is extracted during the salt production process. The museum exhibition comprises a rich collection of photographs authentic tools and other exhibits. Visitors can take a tour around the functioning salt-mines. Old Pomorian Houses Reserve is situated near the seacoast at the eastern end of Pomorie. The buildings found there provide examples of the typical architectural design of the houses in the Black Sea Region. When strolling around Pomorie do not miss the chance to visit some of its Christian temples – St. George Monastery the Church of the Transfiguration of God – the oldest building in the town the Birth of the Virgin Mary Temple etc. The Pomorian Beehive Tomb lies to the right of the Pomorie – Burgas road. It impresses with its architectural design and it is the only one of its kind on the Balkan Peninsula. According to some people the tomb served as a mausoleum of a wealthy family from Anchialus. Some of the finds discovered there can be seen in the History Museum. It was declared an architectural-construction monument of culture by virtue of publication in State Gazette issue No 35 of 1965.

We look at the different options for extending your travels upwards to the bonnie Highlands. 1. By train Scotland is well-connected with London thanks to the UK’s excellent extensive rail network. For example the train journey from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh can take as little as 4 hours 20 minutes and cost as low as £40 one way if you book in advance. Regular rail services also run to Glasgow 4hrs 30mins Dundee 5hrs 50mins Aberdeen 7hrs Inverness 8hrs with connections to regional stops too. Useful websites for booking train tickets to Scotland Buy as far in advance as you can to get the best prices - use websites like The Trainline or direct with the rail operators for this route Virgin Trains and East Coast. Rail passes A BritRail GB Pass offers unlimited rail travel on any train service in Britain. A flexible version is also available. 2. By sleeper train Yes that’s right – there is a way to travel in the UK where in the evening hub-bub of London you can board a train wine and dine in a sedate lounge car that echoes of yesteryear before retiring to your cosy compartment for a restorative night’s sleep. You wake up the next morning with a cup of tea brought by your steward then look out the window to see you’re in the Highlands with deer running beside the track. The Caledonian Sleeper train runs from London Euston to the heart of Scotland every night of the week apart from Saturdays and there are reclining seats for a cheaper alternative to the compartments. A most civilised way to travel! The sleeper train takes 13 hours from London Euston to Fort William – a great spot from which to explore the Highlands. There are also services to Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and Aberdeen. Useful websites for planning your snooze cruise See the Caledonian Sleeper website also read London to Scotland by sleeper by the Man in Seat 61. You can also book tickets on the National Rail website and The Trainline as well as at any railway station in Britain. 3. By car Maybe the more laborious option but you’ll have the freedom to stop where you like and could break up the journey taking in some other amazing areas of the UK. The Lake District serves as a perfect mid-way stopping point and will warm you up for the mountains of Scotland. This could also work out as the cheaper of the options if you share the journey with others and split the cost of fuel. The drive from central London to Glasgow takes around 7hrs to Edinburgh around 7hrs 30mins and to Inverness around 10hrs 30mins. 4. By coach National Express runs from London Victoria Coach Station regularly throughout the day with journey times of 8hrs 15mins to Glasgow 9hrs to Edinburgh and 12hrs 35mins to Inverness. Budget provider Megabus operates routes to Aberdeen Dundee Edinburgh Glasgow Inverness and Perth and also offers a sleeper coach with beds on the Glasgow route. 5. By plane Possibly the quickest – and often cheapest – option though remember to take into account any travel to and from the airport additional luggage charges and so on. Budget airline easyJet has regular daily flights leave from London’s Gatwick and Luton airports to Glasgow Inverness Aberdeen and Edinburgh and from London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow. British Airways has regular daily flights leave from London’s Gatwick Heathrow and City airports to Glasgow and Edinburgh and from London’s Heathrow and City airports to Aberdeen. 6. By foot...

The border with Turkey is situated at a distance of only about 40 km south from Tsarevo. The municipality territory occupies a large part of Strandzha Mountain. The town population is about 5000 people. In the past the town was called Vasiliku 12th century. There is evidence that in 1351 it was called Vasilikos and by 1934 it was known under the name of Vasiliko. Within the period 1950 – 1991 the town had the name of Michurin. Since 1991 the town had had its present name – Tsarevo. The town had a developed port and great traditions in shipbuilding and fishing. The proximity to Strandzha where wooden material for ship-construction was taken was one of the basic advantages of Tsarevo. Traditionally smaller to medium-sized ships were built in the shipbuilding plant in Tsarevo but their distinctive feature was their sharp ship bow. In Greek this part of the ship was called Karina. That is why the local residents were called kakarini. There was a flotilla of 42 ships in the sea town during the first half of the 19th century. Grain and grape were grown in the region. They were the basic goods with which the local population was trading. Tsarevo maintained good commercial relations with the capital of the Ottoman Empire – Constantinople and with ports in Aegean and Marmara Sea. After the Liberation of Bulgaria of Ottoman dominion 1878 the town remained within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. After the Balkan War 1912 – 1913 the town was again included within the Bulgarian borders. Nowadays Tsarevo is divided into an old and a new part. During the 1880s a great fire destroyed a large part of the town and today there are a few buildings that had remained after the fire. The church The Assumption of St. Mary” is situated on the south peninsula of Tsarevo. Another temple existed at the place of nowadays’ church. The church was built in 1831 and its contemporary appearance has existed since 1895. Some of the icons in the temple date back to the end of the 18th century. The resort settlement of Lozenets is situated at a distance of 7 km from the town. The beaches of the former camping areas of Coral South and Oasis are situated near Tsarevo. Other small resort towns such as Ahtopol Sinemorets Kiten etc. are also situated nearby. The proximity of Strandzha is the reason for the well developed ecological and mountainous tourism in the region. There are marked routes on the territory of the natural park of Strandzha. While tourists walk along them they can learn more about the history the animal and plant species in the region. The rivers around Tsarevo are abundant in terms of fish. Fishermen standing on the bridges and shores are often seen here. Tsarevo has a rich cultural schedule. Traditionally the following events are conducted in August Week of the Sea International Festival of Honey Dew international and national folklore festivals. There are a lot of hotels guest houses and camping sites on the territory of Tsarevo. They offer accommodation depending on the means and the taste of the tourists.

The Durankulak Lake lies to the southeast of the village. It is one of the most important and best- preserved ecosystems in Bulgaria with international importance for the protection of multiple rare and endangered plant and animal species. The lake is located on the migration route Via Pontica and it provides a suitable place for nesting and wintering of multiple species of migratory birds. The lake is detached from the sea by a thin sand line and two islands are located in its western part. Exceptionally rich and interesting archaeological finds have been made on the western shore of the lake and the Large Island. During archaeological excavations at the settlement mound of the Large Island in the Durankulak Lake a unique archaeological site had been found containing evidences of human presence dating back to the late Neolith the second half of the 6th millennium BC – a settlement dating back to the late stone and copper age the late bronze and the beginning of the early iron age.

Varna is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest one on the Black Sea shore with a population of about 330 000 people. Because of its history and its economic and cultural significance it is often called the Sea Capital of Bulgaria. The average January temperature in Varna is +1.7 °С the average July temperature is +22.8 °С and the average annual temperature is +12.2 ° С which makes it very appropriate for holiday sea tourism during the warm months of the year. The town was established in the 6th century BC under the name of Odessos by emigrants from the town of Milet in Asia Minor. For a short time it turned into a polis and one of the most important ports and commercial centers on the Black Sea. For a few decades Odessos was within the borders of the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great but later it reestablished its independence and again rose as an economic commercial and cultural center. The city was coining its own money which is evidence of its development. In the 15th year AD Odessos was included within the borders of the Roman Empire. In 1201 the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan born 1168– died 1207 integrated the town to Bulgaria and in 1366 Varna was given to the Dobrudzha ruler Dobrotitsa and it had served as his capital. In 1398 Varna was conquered by the Ottoman conquerors. During the Revival 18th – 19th century it developed as a cultural and commercial center. Today Varna is a modern city with a rich cultural calendar. Two of the most modern multifunctional halls in the county are situated here – the Palace of Culture and Sports and the Festival and Congress Center which allow the conducting of multiple international cinema festivals scientific forums and sport events among which are the following International Theater Festival Varna Summer” Ethnic Festival International Jazz Festival Varna Summer” International Folklore Festival of Varna International Film Festival Love is Folly” International Festival of Puppet Art Golden Dolphin” International Photographic Saloon Bulgarian Film Festival Golden Rose” etc. With its modern port railway connection and international airport providing a connection with 35 states and more than 100 world cities Varna is one of the largest transport centers in Bulgaria. The strategic position of Varna on the map of south-eastern Europe has turned the city into one of the largest settlements on the Black Sea shore since antiquity. Multiple monuments presented today in the city Archaeological Museum date back to this period. The museum’s impressive collection includes the finds from the Varna chalcolythic necropolis – the oldest golden treasure in the world found by now dating back to six thousand years ago.

Amongst castles cobbled streets parks and museums this historic region hosts more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city in Britain outside London. YUM. Edinburgh local Kate Bouchier-Hayes has lived in the city for well over a decade. We polled the roller derby player and public relations professional on her favorite workouts culture trips and most importantly FOOD for our Britain Insiders series. As it turns out her responses make a picture-perfect weekender’s guide to the city. © Kate Bouchier-Hayes Edinburgh is a big city! Tell us about your neighborhood Leith. I moved to Edinburgh about 15 years ago -- during that time Ive lived in quite a few different parts of the city but Leith is my favourite. It has its own identity and character and it’s a buzzing creative community in its own right. Leith is located just out of the city centre in Edinburghs historic dock area which gives it a strong sense of place. Leith provides the best of all worlds in that you have the stunning historic buildings and old maritime references that Edinburgh is famous for which can be spotted throughout The Shore area peace and tranquility as offered by long walks along the Water of Leith and a buzzing atmosphere created by fantastic bars and restaurants. © Instagram / @BouchierBants Describe your typical weekend. 9 a.m. -- Exercise I try and strike a balance in my weekends so I like to get out for a decent walk possibly to blow the cobwebs away from the night before! in the morning. In Edinburgh we are lucky to have a cracking range of options on our doorstep many of which won’t be traditionally associated with the city. There’s a bracing beach walk along the old promenade at Portobello a peaceful dander up the Water of Leith or if youre feeling a bit more energetic a climb up Arthur’s Seat. It’s always a challenge but the sweeping views at the top of the sleeping volcano are always worth it! Aside from walks jogging and outdoor bootcamps are big in Edinburgh as the citys landscape is naturally so well-suited to challenging routes. I myself play roller derby with the Auld Reekie Roller Girls -- it’s not something Edinburgh is well-known for but we actually have the biggest team in Scotland and one of the top-ranked in the UK! © Instagram / @BouchierBants 12 p.m. -- Brunch Exercise quota met I usually catch up with pals for a bite to eat and a chat. Firm favorites for brunch and lunch right now are Urban Angel always book ahead! Roseleaf and Harmonium a fab new vegan restaurant at The Shore. © Instagram / @HarmoniumBar 3 p.m. -- A dose of culture Edinburgh has a hugely rich cultural offering so I try and get a bit into my weekends when I can. Sometimes its an exhibition at The National Museum of Scotland City Art Centre or National Portrait Gallery. Other times it’s a new piece of theatre at The Lyceum or Traverse Theatre or a film at the iconic Edinburgh Filmhouse. The struggle usually comes in packing it all into one weekend. Theyre just never long enough! © Instagram / @BouchierBants In recent years Leiths exciting creative community has really developed which is also key to what makes the area so special. New galleries and artist spaces are popping up including the recently reopened Leith Custom House. This year numerous venues in Leith like the historic Leith Theatre will be used as performance spaces as part of Edinburghs famous Festivals. One of Edinburgh’s best qualities is how walkable it is. After living in the city for over 15 years it amazes me that I still discover new parts of it. Exploring the Old Town on foot is certainly a must-do the city is a warren of medieval cobbled streets and historical gems! I also love escaping to the rooftop terrace at The National Museum of Scotland which has one of the most amazing 360-degree views of the city. 7 p.m. -- Dinner I LOVE eating. Seriously. Edinburgh has more restaurants per capita than any British city outside of London so theres always plenty to choose from! For me Edinburgh’s dining scene stands out in terms of quality and diversity. No matter your budget -- from a Michelin-starred restaurant to the most exciting street food and fresh produce markets -- Edinburgh has something to fit the bill. Weve seen a few trends really grab the culinary scene recently First it was burgers Bread Meats Bread Holyrood 9A Nobles then authentic Mexican food El Cartel Bodega Topolabamba and now it seems to be wine bars Pickles Toast The Fat Pony. I’m still trying to make my way around them all! © Instagram / @BouchierBants As much as I love to check out a new place I do have my firm favorites depending on what Im in the mood for. For a treat or special occasion it has to be Aizle the neo-bistro with a constantly-changing five-course menu -- including amazing cocktails -- without any pretense or awkward formality. For something more chilled you cant go wrong with Ting Thai Caravan. It started as a pop-up at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and its now a year-round fixture serving up brilliant no-fuss Thai street food. Their bubble prawns and pad thai are my go-to dishes. © Instagram / @Aizle_Edinburgh If it’s date night I love Origano on Leith Walk. It’s got a lovely vibe and is a top contender for the best pizza in the city. The centerpiece of the restaurant is a massive purple pizza oven which provides warmth and a cracking pizza! For a special occasion Rhubarb at Prestonfield House oozes a dramatic sense of magical gothic romance with its deeply dark décor and the very best fine dining. Cosy favorites are Teuchters Landing Nobles and The Kings Wark all showcasing the very best Scottish produce in very different settings. 9 p.m. -- Grab a drink As you might expect Edinburgh has plenty to choose from! If you fancy something a bit more traditional Id go for The Bow Bar Teuchters Landing or Scotch at The Balmoral. For a contemporary twist go for a whisky cocktail in Edinburghs top cocktail bars Bramble The Devils Advocate Under the Stairs or Epicurean the G&V Royal Mile Hotel bar. © Instagram / @BouchierBants 11 p.m. -- Hit the town. In my opinion Leith’s bars are some of the best in the city. An old favorite is The Carriers Quarters the oldest unaltered pub in Leith dating back to 1785 which is always a cracking spot for a great pint and live music. Newcomers include Leith Depot The Lioness of Leith and the recently-revamped Port o’ Leith. The Edinburgh live music scene is small but brilliant! Venues such as Sneaky Petes The Voodoo Rooms The Liquid Room and Leith Depot all host brilliant live music acts. Bigger venues such as The Queen’s Hall and Usher Hall host a range of acts from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra to Queens of the Stone Age. © Instagram / @BouchierBants For more Scottish travel inspiration follow Kate on Instagram - @bouchierbants Latest Blogs Foodie map of Britain Foodie map of Britain Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Take on Britains best cycling routes Take on Britains best cycling routes Exploring Brent – Londons next Borough of Culture Exploring Brent – Londons next Borough of Culture 48 hours in Leeds 48 hours in Leeds Stay up to date Email Subscribe Find us on Facebook Twitter Instagram OUR WEBSITE Terms of use Sitemap Cookies Privacy Policy General Competition Terms and Conditions Accessibility statement User Generated Content Terms of Use Our other sites CorporateTradeBusiness EventsSelect languageMedia © 2020 VisitBritain.

5ee8a97c2daef1fe6a923aa9,https://www.france.fr/en/normandy/list/normandy-what-to-do-what-to-see,Happening now in France Places to go Things to do Plan your trip Search on France.fr Proposed by Places to go / Normandy / Normandy what to do what to see... By France.fr © AVTG / Getty Images — The cliffs of the Alabaster Coast on the Atlantic Ocean in Normandy near Fécamp. Normandy is home to one of the wonders of the Western world. A jewel of French heritage set on its own rocky island in an enormous bay Mont-Saint-Michel. Normandy is a world of picturesque villages with cobbled streets and Gothic churches all of which were sources of inspiration for Impressionist painter Claude Monet. But Normandy also has its eye on the future in hi-tech cities like Le Havre. Come on let’s go... Not to miss sights in Normandy © Dan Wilding / Unsplash — Mont-Saint-Michel a must-see during your stay in Normandy. • Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay Originally in 709 this rock was occupied by a simple little church. Over the centuries an abbey convent buildings surrounding walls and a village were erected to make Mont Saint-Michel a spiritual and intellectual home in addition to a place of pilgrimage. Witnessing the island monastary emerge from the bay between sea and sky is breathtaking in its majestic beauty. • The planks of Deauville This storied wood walk is mythical dating from 1923 and bordering the Art Deco style bath cabins along the beach. How many stars have walked on these 643 meters 2010 feet? Joséphine Baker Buster Keaton Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk Aimée in A Man and a Woman not to mention the stars of the American Film Festival. Today its still the place to see and be seen. • The landing beaches On June 6 1944 the beaches of Normandy were the historical theater of the great military operation which mobilized an armada of boats and planes to free France from the German occupation. Museums and cemeteries line this coast from Sword Beach to Ouistreham Juno Beach to Courseulles-sur-Mer Gold Beach to Arromanches Omaha Beach to Colleville-sur-Mer Utah Beach to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and to the Pointe du Hoc in Cricqueville-en Bessin. • The Caen Memorial This memorial retraces the period before and after 1945 reviving D-Day the Battle of Normandy World War and the Cold War. This is a touching dive into the heart of the 20th century. • The cliffs of Étretat They stand out from the Alabaster Coast like three vertical limestone soldiers marching into the sea. The Manneporte Courtine and Aiguille which have inspired so many painters are visible from the shoreline from a boat or from a path overlooking the Channel. • Le Havre and its post World War II architecture About 80% destroyed during the Second World War the city was rebuilt by the architect Auguste Perret specialist in reinforced concrete. It is necessary to see his achievements in brick and morter calibrated and harmonious like the town hall St Josephs Church and its tower of 110 meters 360 feet and the Peret appartments typical of the 1950s. Altogether they are all listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. • Notre-Dame Cathedral in Evreux Built between the 10th and 13th centuries the imposing cathedral retains both a Romanesque and Gothic style. Its 70 stained glass windows some of which are made with the famous Yellow Evreux silver salt dazzle every visitor without fail. • Gros Horloge and Rouen Cathedral The Gros Horloge is a beautiful Renaissance pavilion spanning the street and sporting a clock face. From the platform of the belfry those brave enough to climb it are rewarded with a panoramic view of the roofs of old Rouen. Look up a bit further to spy the Gothic towers of the superb cathedral which house the namesake organ of Richard the Lionheart. • The small port of Dieppe Strolling on the port of Dieppe one is plunged back into the luminous landscapes of Turner Pissaro or Gauguin all subjugated by the colors of the houses which are reflected in the water and by the animation of the quays between two fishing rafts. • The pretty village of Veules-les-Roses Plan a stop in this seaside resort of the Pays de Caux brimming with old-fashioned charm which nestled along the Veules the smallest river in France at 1149 meters 3770 feet long! Between the sea and the countryside the village and its mills ensared Victor Hugo Paul Meurice and the painter Camille Marchand. • The D-Day Landing Beaches External link • The cliffs at Étretat External link • Mont Saint-Michel and its bay External link • The boardwalks of Deauville External link • The Caen Memorial External link • The cathedral of Rouen External link • The tiny port of Dieppe External link • Le Havre External link Things to do in Normandy © Julien - AdobeStock — Normandy especially in Giverny is the cradle of Impressionism and has inspired many painters like Claude Monet. • Discover Monets impressions at Giverny Resettling 1883 in a house in Giverny on the right bank of the Seine the painter Claude Monet was inspired by his gardens to paint his finest works such as the series of 250 Nymphéas. Today the village retains its impressionist touch thanks to the many artists who live there. • Get lost at night in the Mont-Saint-Michel abbey In the summer when night falls follow the abbeys trail of mysteries...did you really see that peregrine falcon nestling in the spire or did your imagination play tricks on you? Regardless the night route allows you to discover the architecture and magic of the monastary under the velvet blanket of darkness. • In Étretat golf cart and golf clubs are waiting for you The Etretat golf course is perched at the top of the cliffs overlooking the bay. For 110 years the course has been demanding and the view impregnable especially on hole number 10! Check out what you need to know about golf in Normandy here. • Put on your best hat to attend a horse race Normandy is a breeding ground for horses and stud farms. Come and cheer on the champions in full gallop at the racetracks of Deauville or Cabourg. Connoisseurs from around the world come to admire the finest thoroughbreds and the best jockeys. Place your bets! • Drooling for Honfleur mussels and fries In Honfleur enjoy strolling around the Vieux Bassin lined with tall narrow houses crowned with slate roofs or criss-cross the alleys of the medieval district of LEnclos. Of course you have to visit the Sainte Catherine church hewn totally in wood and the Musée Eugène Boudin who hails from this part of France. Not to mention the mussels and fries—its the taste of Honfleur! • Feel growing in front of the Cherbourg harbor Imagine almost 4 kilometers 2.5 miles of pier in open sea facing the city an artificial harbor created to defend the city against the English. Begun under Louis XVI and finished under Napoleon III as with several military forts today this technical feat effectively protects the port from sea erosion. • Visit the Bayeux Military Cemetery The largest British cemetery in France is a place of memory which contains more than 4600 graves of soldiers of 11 different nationalities killed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944. • Tour the Grand Dukes in Deauville Deauville has always been a festive resort and it lives up to its reputation today! To start the evening head for an iconic bistro serving seafood or a vintage-style brewery or splurge on a grand hotel bar. Then head to the casino where you can try your luck at roulette poker and the 300 slot machines. Finally shake it off at one of Deauvilles clubs beloved by the stars of yesterday. • Immerse yourself in the incredible collection of MUMA in Le Havre In a concrete and glass building inaugurated in 1961 the André Malraux Museum of Modern Art exhibits one of the largest collections of Impressionist paintings thanks to the donation of Hélène Senn-Foulds. The museum is a playground of light setting off the subtle hues of Renoir Sisley Pissaro and Degas. • Leave for a romantic weekend in Cabourg The pedestrian promenade on the seafront the Belle Epoque homes the legendary Grand Hotel where Marcel Proust loved to stay its 4 kilometer 2.5 miles of beach as far as the eye can see rends Cabourg perfect for a romantic getaway. • Mont-Saint-Michel External link • Monet at Giverny External link • Étretat External link • Cherbourg External link • Bayeux External link • Dive into the incredible collection of modern art at MuMa in Le Havre External link • Go for a romantic weekend in Cabourg External link Zoom in Plan your trip External link Normandy Tourism External link National Monuments Center - Abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel External link By France.fr The destination magazine tells you about an unexpected France that revisits tradition and cultivates creativity.

5ee8a97c2daef1fe6a923a70,https://www.france.fr/en/lyon/article/bouchons-lyonnais,Happening now in France Places to go Things to do Plan your trip Search on France.fr Proposed by Places to go / Lyon / Everything you need to know about Lyon’s bouchons in 5 minutes By Constance Dive  Published 19 May 2019 1659 © Julien Bouvier — Chef Joseph Viola’s Nainua-style dumplings with Lyonnaise sauce at Daniel & Denise in Lyon Tablier de sapeur cervelle de canuts nappe à carreaux and mâchon... in Lyon they don’t joke about the bouchon tradition! In this typical restaurant you can try traditional dishes in a friendly atmosphere. France.fr reveals the secrets of this institution and offers a few tips to enhance your meal at a bouchon. A history of women And more specifically mothers. In the 19th century modest self-taught cooks tended small simple but hearty dishes. Their mantra don’t spoil anything. They used the lowliest pieces of meat shin breast and other cuts judged less noble than fillets. Among the most famous were Mère Fillioux made famous by her truffled poultry or Mère Brazier who learned the basics with Mère Fillioux before launching her own restaurant and becoming the first woman to receive three Michelin stars. A garnish of baby onions A counter red and white checked tablecloths wooden furniture closely arranged tables hanging copper pots and old posters not to mention the noises and smells of cooking that make your mouth water... at a bouchon conviviality and simplicity take precedence on the plate as well as in the dining room. Add to that a charismatic owner and authentic dishes – and the experience is complete! © Julien Bouvier — At Daniel & Denise in Lyon guests enjoy chef Joseph Viola’s cooking Do you speak bouchon? The menu – or rather the chalk board – at a bouchon can be a little confusing for those who don’t speak Lyonnais. Whet your appetite with grattons crunchy pieces of browned pork fat. Continue with a Lyon sausage cured with pistachios. Then come the dumplings a pâté called ‘panade’ of poultry meat veal or fish or the tablier de sapeur a speciality with beef tripe. The cervelle de canut despite its name is a kind of cheese dip with herbs and onions. Finish with the pink praline pie as beautiful to look at as to taste. By the way why ‘bouchon’? The term ‘bouchon’ originates from the bunches of twigs cabaret owners hung on their doors to advertise their establishment. But according to the association Les Bouchons Lyonnais it’s best to ask each one for its own version of the story… © M. Cellar — La Mère Brazier a famous Lyonnais bouchon led by two-Michelin-starred chef Matthieu Viannay in Lyon Conviviality authenticity and excellence! In bouchons they don’t mess with quality. The Bouchons Lyonnais association brings together restaurateurs who are committed to perpetuating the tradition and authenticity of the bouchon. To find them look out for the yellow plate with the face of Gnafron a famous Lyon puppet and sidekick of Guignol known to be a ‘bon viveur’. Behind the ovens are also great chefs such as Joseph Viola Best Worker of France who runs Daniel & Denise a Lyonnais bouchon with four outlets. Or Mathieu Viannay who continues the work of the mother-founder of the bouchon Eugénie Brazier with two Michelin stars to his name. The mâchon breakfast of the canuts We owe the tradition of the mâchon to canuts silk weavers who settled in Lyon’s Croix-Rousse district in the 19th century. After a night of hard work they enjoyed a ‘pot Lyonnais’ of pork with red wine from Beaujolais or Mâconnais. For those who like a hearty breakfast some bouchons still maintain this custom. La Meunière Café du Peintre Vivarais and Poêlon d’Or are four such establishments also members of the Bouchons Lyonnais association.

It is situated at a distance of 50 kilometers from Burgas and 450 kilometers from the capital city Sofia. The population of the town is 2800 people and in the summer season the number of people increases several times due to the numerous tourists choosing Primorsko for their summer vacation. The climate in Primorsko is temperate-continental with Black Sea and Mediterranean influence with mild short winters and long summers. The average temperature in July is 23-24° С. There are four sanctuaries found near Primorsko as well as 12 dolmens and 10 mound necropolises. The most interesting for tourists is the sanctuary Beglik Tash which embodies the cult of the sun. The rock sanctuary near Primorsko is one of the greatest discoveries of the Thracian civilization at the Southern Black Sea coast and Strandzha. It is located in the central highest part of Beglik Tash peak with a height of 128 meters above sea level and covers an area of about 6 decares.

Despite its proximity to big resorts such as Slanchev bryag Sunny Beach and Nesebar Ravda remains a quiet place with a nice beach suitable for people of all ages. It is an especially popular holiday destination for families with children. Many legends tell the story of how the village was founded and how it got its name. One legend has it that centuries ago shepherds settled in the region and the place was named after one of them – Ravadin. Another legend says that a long time ago these lands belonged to a bad landowner who used to beat his workers with a stick called ravdas. Most interesting is the legend according to which the god Neptune fell in love with a beautiful girl called Ravdalina and wished to take her to the depths of the sea with him but she refused. Infuriated by her reaction the god sent a water storm to destroy the village but the other gods prevented the disaster. Thus the big waves formed numerous coves. An interesting place to visit in Ravda is the Church of St. Paraskevi. It was built in 1884 by two Greeks Vasilios and Teodorakis who worked together with the local people. The temple was restored in 1998. Ravda beach spreads out on an area of 57 000 sq m and is divided in two by Cape Ravda. The south beach attracts tourists with its nice sand clean seawater and various forms of entertainment while the north beach offers a quiet relaxing atmosphere. Ravda provides visitors with many opportunities to practice water sports such as diving jet-skiing yachting windsurfing etc. Ravda’s immediate proximity to Nesebar Slanchev bryag Sveti Vlas Elenite and Aheloy allows for a varied holiday. People who are interested in cultural tourism can visit Nesebar. Slanchev bryag is famous for the various forms of entertainment it offers. Those who want variety can go to a different beach every day. The resorts are connected to each other by regular transport and the rides are very short. Ravda provides many accommodation opportunities there are hotel complexes apartments family hotels rental rooms etc. There are also many restaurants in the village and the majority of them serve seafood.

But exactly where is it and how can you visit this wondrous mystical place? So what actually is it? Wales is a country that is part of the UK situated on the west of the island of Great Britain bordered by England to its east. You don’t need a passport to cross the border between Wales and England as they’re both part of the UK. Wales is a small country with a population of approximately 3 million and an area of around 8023 sq miles 20779 sq km. It closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain but has retained a distinct cultural identity. It is one of the few bilingual countries in the world with much of the population speaking Welsh as well as English. You will see road signs written in both languages as you travel around the country. Aahhh...picturesque Wales What’s there to see? The scenery! Wales has more than 1680 miles 2700 km of stunning coastline and is largely mountainous here you can climb the highest mountain in England and Wales – Snowdon – at 3560ft 1085m. Wales’s natural landscape is so wonderful it boasts 3 of Britain’s National Parks Snowdonia is mountainous and rugged and home to mount Snowdon the Brecon Beacons is all green rolling hills peppered with castles and stone circles and Pembrokeshire covers a wild windswept coastline with never-ending beaches. It’s no wonder it’s in Wales that the adventure sport of coasteering was invented! Wales has no fewer than 5 Areas of Outstanding National Beauty – natural landscapes that are unique or of significant value to conserve. Are you getting the picture yet? Wales is really beautiful! Plus the history! Ancient castles cathedrals houses railways and ruins are everywhere here. In fact Wales has the highest number of castles per square mile than any other country in the world so history buffs and mini conquerors alike have plenty to explore. Possibly the best beach ever? Rhossili Bay Can I visit Wales from London and how? You can get to Wales in an easy 2-hour direct train journey from London. Hop on at London Paddington to reach Cardiff – Wales’s capital city and a great starting point for your explorations. Other parts of Wales can also be reached with the extensive rail network that connects with the rest of Britain. See the National Rail Journey Planner. Train tickets can work out significantly cheaper if booked in advance. Alternatively hire a car either from London or once you arrive in Cardiff. Central London to Cardiff takes approximately 3 hours by car. Car hire companies include Sixt Europcar and easyCar. The AA Route Planner helps you plan driving routes and times. Coach services run from London Victoria Coach Station to various destinations in Wales for as little as £5 and as regularly as once an hour. See National Express and Megabus. Rather someone else arranged it all for you? Many tour companies offer organised trips around the highlights of Wales. The official tourist board VisitWales offers more details on travelling to Wales. Possibly the best castle ever? Conwy Castle 5 things I shouldn’t miss in Wales? Climb or take the train up England and Wales’s highest mountain – Snowdon and explore the scenic walks and villages of the surrounding Snowdonia National Park not missing a fun ride on the heritage Ffestiniog narrow-gauge railway. Visit at least one of those amazing castles. If you only have time to visit one make it Conwy Castle. Built all the way back in 1283 its a magnificent piece of medieval history and the castle along with the citys walls are some of the best preserved of their kind in the world. Pack up a picnic and spend the day on the oft-awarded best beach in the UK Rhossili Bay on the Gower Peninsular with 3 miles of golden sands backed by a wild green landscape. Find more wild and windswept beaches plus towering sea cliffs and abundant wildlife on the Pembrokeshire Coast. Here you’ll also find the smallest city in Britain – St Davids. Despite being tiny and with just 1600 residents its spectacular medieval cathedral has earned it city status. The Brecon Beacons National Park is a beautiful area to explore typically British rolling green hills and picturesque villages. Don’t miss a pint with the locals in a great traditional pub. Be sure to stop by the characterful town of Hay-on-Wye which has a distinctly literary feel due to its famous annual book festival. Books galore in Hay-on-Wye What else is near there? You could easily combine a trip to Wales with an exploration of West England that it borders. From the cider-making countryside of Herefordshire to the picture-postcard Cotswolds and further south the beautiful seaside villages in Devon and Cornwall. Or just north of Wales you can step into historic Chester before reaching the dynamic North England cities of Liverpool and Manchester. Plan your trip With a Wales guidebook and with VisitWales.

With its historical layout and over 1300 timber-framed houses from a period spanning six centuries Quedlinburg is a fine example of a beautifully preserved medieval town. It also boasts a wealth of art nouveau architecture. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The Collegiate Church of St. Servatius burial site of the first German king Henry the Fowler and his wife Mathilde is an architectural masterpiece of the Romanesque and houses one of Germanys foremost collections of ecclesiastical treasure. The triple-naved basilica built between 1070 and 1129 was once the church for the local Damenstift or chapter of unmarried noblewomen. Today the church is a tourist attraction and performance venue for the Quedlinburg Summer of Music. High up on Castle Hill it is the towns most prominent – in both senses of the word – building and just one of the many that have made Quedlinburg which lies in the Harz region of Saxony-Anhalt a multifaceted medieval townscape. For a walk you could start at the market square with its impressive Renaissance town hall and Roland statue. Then make your way to Münzenberg hill with its Romanesque Church of St. Mary through the historical abbey garden and into Brühl Park. All these first-rate attractions are part of the UNESCO World Heritage site. But its at Christmas time that Quedlinburg is especially alluring.

A UNESCO City of Music its packed full of exciting venues that have welcomed well-known artists and emerging stars alike. From the intimate surroundings of the renowned Cavern Club to former coffee bars and vast performance spaces here we explore Liverpool’s music scene and tune into the city’s rich history. 1. British Music Experience To start we rock pop punk and rave our way through 70 years of Britain’s popular music history at the British Music Experience. Featuring a mix of images video and music memorabilia from days gone by the exhibitions offer a glimpse of everything from John Lennon’s iconic glasses to the Spice Girls’ Geri Halliwell’s Union Jack dress. Covering the nation’s thriving jazz scene in the post war years through to the rise of the Beatles David Bowie Blur Pulp and the X-Factor Britain’s musical heritage takes centre stage. 2. The M&S Bank Arena Situated on the banks of the River Mersey this arena and its smaller sister venue EchoTwo are key music venues based in Liverpools former docks. The M&S Bank Arena hosts major rock and pop bands classical music musicals comedy and even sporting events. Opened in 2008 to coincide with the city being named European Capital of Culture the arena has since welcomed stars including Beyoncé Oasis Nile Rodgers and CHIC Lady Gaga and George Michael alongside many many more. 3. Royal Liverpool Philharmonic An art-deco Grade II-listed building the Philharmonic offers a year-round programme that features everything from pop to comedy. Predominantly though this is a classical venue specialising in performances from its own orchestra the longest surviving in Britain dating back to 1840. The orchestra has collaborated with a range of international artists from the world of rock and pop in recent times including Elvis Costello Ian Broudie and the Lightning Seeds and Liverpool’s very own Sir Paul McCartney. 4. Cavern Club The birthplace of Britain’s most iconic band The Beatles the Cavern Club is the cradle of British pop music. Since opening its doors in a warehouse cellar in January 1957 the club has seen a host of up-and-coming bands take to the stage. Its legendary status was cemented during the 60s with the arrival of The Beatles and to this day the club continues to celebrate the past present and future of music. Alongside performances from a band recreating the look and sound of the iconic group a range of other live acts have appeared at the intimate venue including pop sensation Adele. To marks its close ties with The Beatles the club gifted a statue of the Fab Four to the city in 2015 which now has pride of place on the waterfront outside the Cunard Building. 5. LEAF Tea Shop and Bar This is one of Liverpool’s coolest music venues. LEAF is a punk tea room that morphs from being a place to breakfast on organic porridge into a fully-licensed bar and gig venue at night. Although the focus is on tea and delectable food LEAF also welcomes local artists touring bands and DJs to perform providing a platform for those looking to take the city by storm. 6. The Jacaranda Club Renowned as being the first club to host The Beatles in 1960 The Jacaranda Club originally opened as a coffee bar before it was thrown into the musical spotlight. Steeped in musical heritage the live music venue hosts indie and rock ‘n’ roll performers on a regular basis as well as open mic nights to uncover unsigned musical talent. Its second venue launched in 2018 Jacaranda Phase One a vinyl record store and performance space that has become a hotspot on the Liverpool music scene. 7. The Zanzibar Club Known for giving opportunities to new and undiscovered talent The Zanzibar Club on Seel Street is no stranger to well-known acts either.

Despite its proximity to big resorts such as Slanchev bryag Sunny Beach and Nesebar Ravda remains a quiet place with a nice beach suitable for people of all ages. It is an especially popular holiday destination for families with children. Many legends tell the story of how the village was founded and how it got its name. One legend has it that centuries ago shepherds settled in the region and the place was named after one of them – Ravadin. Another legend says that a long time ago these lands belonged to a bad landowner who used to beat his workers with a stick called ravdas. Most interesting is the legend according to which the god Neptune fell in love with a beautiful girl called Ravdalina and wished to take her to the depths of the sea with him but she refused. Infuriated by her reaction the god sent a water storm to destroy the village but the other gods prevented the disaster. Thus the big waves formed numerous coves. An interesting place to visit in Ravda is the Church of St. Paraskevi. It was built in 1884 by two Greeks Vasilios and Teodorakis who worked together with the local people. The temple was restored in 1998. Ravda beach spreads out on an area of 57 000 sq m and is divided in two by Cape Ravda. The south beach attracts tourists with its nice sand clean seawater and various forms of entertainment while the north beach offers a quiet relaxing atmosphere. Ravda provides visitors with many opportunities to practice water sports such as diving jet-skiing yachting windsurfing etc. Ravda’s immediate proximity to Nesebar Slanchev bryag Sveti Vlas Elenite and Aheloy allows for a varied holiday. People who are interested in cultural tourism can visit Nesebar. Slanchev bryag is famous for the various forms of entertainment it offers. Those who want variety can go to a different beach every day. The resorts are connected to each other by regular transport and the rides are very short. Ravda provides many accommodation opportunities there are hotel complexes apartments family hotels rental rooms etc. There are also many restaurants in the village and the majority of them serve seafood.

The complex used to be a royal summer residence for the monarchs who ruled Bulgaria after the liberation of the country from the Ottoman Dominion 1878 – Alexander Battenberg Ferdinand and Boris the 3rd. Knyaz Battenberg visited Varna in 1880 and he was welcomed at the monastery St. Dimitar” which was situated at the same place where now the residence stands. The monarch liked the local nature so much that two years later the Varna municipality bestowed him the monastery and its adjoining lands. Knyaz Battenberg immediately began building his palace which was called by the local people Sandrovo named after him but the project was completed in the period 1887 – 1900 by his successor – Knyaz Ferdinand. The exterior of the palace is very similar to the French Renaissance palaces of the 18th century. The interior is also quite impressive – large halls beautiful decorations stylish English furniture authentic marble fireplaces French chandeliers and wall and fireplace clocks inlaid with gold rare paintings hanging on walls covered in golden silk wallpapers. In 1893 the palace of Sandrovo was renamed to Evksinograd. The new name came from the ancient Greek name of the Black Sea – Evksinos Pontos. One of the first power plants in Bulgaria was built at the palace in the same year. The palace park is an integral component of the Evksinograd complex. Knyaz Ferdinand attracted French park architects to design the 800 decare park in 1888. The project involved a rare tree species collection – from black oak to Atlantic cedar which are the only species on the Balkan Peninsula. The bare and stony areas were covered in fertile soil mostly taken from the valley of the Kamchiya river. Greenhouses were built northeast of the palace for wintering of the palm trees and flower production. More than 500 flower species and 200 sapling species are grown there and in the arboretum. The park contains several district zones central with the palace Greek garden English garden Riverside Beach and production areas. Each one of them is unique by its specific look and characteristics. The most elegant and representative part of the park is the space in front of the palace which has a lake with a bronze statue of Neptune delivered from France. In 1891 a palace winery was built as a part of the complex and a successor of the old monastery cellar. The initiative belongs to Knyaz Ferdinand and the design was made by a German architect. The building is a picturesque house in Bulgarian Revival style. It includes two underground levels a host wing a laboratory a bottling workshop administrative offices and a degustation room. The size of the winery is one of a small boutique production. The wines of Evksinograd are nowadays known for their excellent quality. For the winery production are used grapes from Chardonnay Riesling Traminer Muscat Ottone and Vratsa Muscat. The white wines are produced by classical and modern methods and are stored in oak barrels. The winery is proud with its good brandy and organizes degustation of its best products for guests. Another landmark in the area of the residence is the ruins of the late ancient fortress Kastritsi in the northeastern part of the park. Evksinograd is open to tourists.

The city which has a population of 5000 is one of the oldest on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and one of the country’s most popular seaside resorts. The romantic atmosphere of the city’s beautiful old town attracts visitors from all over the world. Archeological research indicates that the city has a 7000 years old cultural tradition. The first settlement grew up on the Sozopol bay during the Neolithic Era some 6000 years BCE. In 610 BCE the inhabitants of Milet a city in Asia Minor made the Sozopol peninsula their city-state and called it Apolloniya. The city-state enjoyed rapid growth during the first centuries of its existence. In the 5th century BCE massive fortress walls were constructed to protect its monumental public buildings. Ancient writers describe The Temple of Apollo the Healer as colossal housing a 13-meter high statue of the god. In 72 BCE Apollonia was conquered by Roman legions commanded by Marcus Lucullus who razed and plundered the city. The legendary statue of Apollo was removed to Rome as spoils of war. During the 1st century the city was rebuilt and when Thrace became a Roman province Sozopol continued to function as an administrative maritime center. When Christianity was accepted as the official state religion Apolloniya was rechristened Sozopolis in keeping with the new Christian dogma. In the 5th century the city was again fortified by new protective walls remnants of which remain to the present day and can be seen at the southeastern end of the peninsula. The city was first incorporated into Bulgaria when the army of Han Krum occupied it in 812. Sozopol became an important diocese with more than 20 Orthodox churches and 5 monasteries. Remains of the Saint Ivan Saint John monastery complex dating from the X-XII century are still preserved as are the Medieval basilica in the city center and part of the Holy Apostles Monastery on Skamniy Rocky Point in the northeastern part of the Old Town. Sozopol’s Old Town was declared a museum-reserve by Ministerial Decree № 320 on September 7 1974. The reserve includes more than 180 residences constructed from the middle of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century. Houses in the Old Town are built of stone and wood and conform to the so-called Black Sea school of architecture. The best known are The Marieta Stefanova House The Kreanoolu House The Todor Zagorov House The Kurtidi House and The Dimitri Laskaridis House among others. Two of Sozopol’s most attractive tourist destinations are the city’s archeological museum and art gallery. In 2010 during archeological excavations of the nearby Saint Ivan Saint John’s Island researchers unearthed holy relics of Saint John the Baptist. Today these invaluable relics are in the care of authorities at The St. Cyril and St. Methodius Church and attract pilgrims from all over the world. Old Sozopol and the relics of Saint John the Baptist were voted the most important of Bulgaria’s Wonders” in 2011. The biggest events in Sozopol are The Apollonia Festival September 1-10 and the July Celebration June 30-July 1. Sozopol has two beaches – the central beach and the Harmani Beach and two other beaches in the immediate vicinity – The Golden Fish Campground and Kavatsi Beach. The city is divided into the Old Town and the modern section. The Old Town is justly renowned for its romantic atmosphere thanks to its narrow cobbled streets and venerable old houses. Sozopol’s modern section is filled with hotels dining establishments and other pleasant diversions. There are many kinds of accommodation available from luxury hotels to small family hotels from guest houses to bungalows. There are also quite a few campgrounds close at hand The Gradina Garden The Zlatna Ribka Golden Fish Kavatsi Veselie Good Times and Smokinya Fig Tree. Sozopol’s restaurants offer typical Bulgarian Black Sea fare along with a variety of specialties. Many sports activities are possible at the city’s beaches including jet-skiing surfing beach volleyball boating and fishing. The Ropotamo Nature Reserve is a short distance south of Sozopol on the river of the same name. There visitors may take riverboat trips to view the region’s rich assortment of birds and plant life.

Blenheim Palace Oxfordshire The great house in question was the unspeakably grand Blenheim Palace itself a rare pinnacle of the short-lived English-baroque period and a place with all kinds of tales to tell. From the rise and eventual exile of the great John Churchill military hero of the 18th century all the way up to the more familiar Winston Churchill Britain’s World War 2 Prime Minister it has seen a great many historical figures pass through its doors Winston Churchill was actually born here though he later lived at Chartwell. Today it’s part museum part home and part memorial surrounded by sweeping green parkland it’s also an essential part of any trip to Oxfordshire. Magdalen College by Interbeat Blenheim Palace is just the beginning however an appetiser for Oxfordshire’s delights. When you hit the city of Oxford itself it’s as if you’ve been transported back in time. From the elegant spires and crenelated medieval towers of Oxford University’s colleges to a host of half-timbered taverns cobbled lanes and old-fashioned shops its combination of grandeur and charm is overwhelming. Oxford Hidden-away squares adorned with Victorian style lampposts make you feel as though you’ve stumbled out of the wardrobe and into Narnia. Which in a way you have C.S. Lewis creator of the Narnia stories created them right here in Oxford when he was a professor at Magdalen College. There’s some debate as to exactly which of these Victorian lamp-posts was the exact lamp-post that inspired him but most say it was the lamp hanging in the courtyard outside his rooms in Magdalen. While we’re talking about books don’t forget that Christ Church college in Oxford became the fictional wizards’ college Hogwarts for the Harry Potter films. Whether you’re a Narnia or Harry Potter fan the feeling of exploring a timeless fairy-tale city is ever-present in Oxford. Christ Church college by Ariaski After stopping for lunch in one of Oxford oldest pubs – the 13th century Turf Tavern I walked over to the famous Radcliffe Camera easily recognisable by its huge silver-blue dome. Tours are available here and lead you right down into the underground tunnels where the book stacks of the huge Bodleian and Radcliffe libraries are to be found. Radcliffe Camera by tejvanphotos Just around the corner is the Museum of the History of Science while a little further north you come to one of my personal favourites the Pitt Rivers Museum. Filled to the rafters with wonders from around the world the museum staff hand you a torch and send you off to explore the darker recesses of the building adding a whole other level of atmosphere to the experience. Feeling a little like you’ve discovered your very own lost civilisation you emerge into the sunlight with a renewed sense of wonder. Pitt Rivers Museum by bazzadarambler But Oxfords not just about heritage. The city bustles with contemporary culture too and the sound of its fiercely independent music scene echoes from its abundance of pubs and live music venues on most nights of the week. Modern Art Oxford is one of the UK’s best modern art galleries while shoppers will discover a rich seam of consumer delights is to be had here from major stores to cosy independent shops tucked away down little lanes. You’ll find some great bookshops here too as you might expect in such a learning-orientated city. Bridge of Sighs by Fearless Fred If you want to unwind in the open air Oxford is home to some magnificent green spaces. South Park is one of the biggest and gives you an unrivalled view down to the spires and towers of the Oxford skyline - come here in the morning or at sunset to make the most of it! South Park by tejvanphotos Outside of the city youre surrounded by the rolling green hills meadows and river valleys of the Oxfordshire Cotswolds interrupted here and there by idyllic country towns like Chipping Norton Burford and Witney. Chipping Norton by tejvanphotos Visiting Oxfordshire is a vital part of any trip to Britain as it brings together such a great cluster of classic British things. Beautiful historic architecture grand stately homes traditional pubs the rural tranquillity of the Cotswolds and the beating heart of the citys modern cultural scene. Get out there and experience it all for yourself!

Stroll the gardens of Gravetye Manor Sussex This elegant Elizabethan manor house was awarded Good Hotel Guide’s César for Country House Hotel of the Year 2017 and for very good reason. The service is flawless and the grounds are glorious. From 1884 to 1935 Gravetye was owned by William Robinson revered gardener and pioneer of the English natural garden style. For the ultimate taste of the manor pick the Lounge and Garden menu take a seat in these amazing gardens and dine on produce plucked from the kitchen garden. Soak up the colourful past of Lewtrenchard Manor Devon If history is your ideal bedfellow make a beeline for Lewtrenchard Manor. Since it first made an appearance in the history books in 1086 AD its owners have lived rather colourful lives. One earned the favour of the newly restored king during the Civil War and was made the Duke of Albemarle. One pretended to be a highwayman and committed murder while trying to retrieve his gambling losses while another penned the hymn Onward Christian Soldiers. Portraits of these figures hang on the walls apparently their ghosts still haunt the place. Take afternoon tea at Cliveden House Berkshire For sheer opulence you can’t beat Cliveden an Italianate mansion above the banks of the River Thames. The Great Hall has an enormous fireplace suits of armour and masses of paintings and antiques all presided over by a grand panelled ceiling. It’s the perfect place to take afternoon tea. Sip Cliveden blend tea as you indulge in delicate finger sandwiches and dainty delicacies or dial up the decadence with a glass of Champagne. Finish with a wander around the gardens. Eat like a king at Hambleton Hall Rutland Hambleton’s restaurant has held a Michelin star since 1982 – the longest retained star in the UK. Head chef Aaron Patterson’s daily-changing menu showcases local produce such as Launde Farm lamb and refreshingly vegetarian dishes get joint top billing. The wine list is equally impressive. Take a sommelier-led tour of the cellar to see the thousands of bottles waiting for their turn in the spotlight. Bread lovers can tour Hambleton’s award-winning traditional bakery in nearby Exton. Do some social climbing at Lords of the Manor Cotswolds If there’s a part of the UK that invites lord and lady-style living it’s the Cotswolds. This timeless cluster of honey-hued villages and green fields is home to a throng of celebrities. Royals Zara Phillips Princess Anne and Prince Charles as well as supermodel Kate Moss and author Jilly Cooper all call the region home. Emulate them at the Lords of the Manor hotel as you sip pre-dinner drinks in the drawing room dine in the Michelin-star restaurant then retire to your bed in the Tracy Room the original master’s room. Feel part of the family at Farlam Hall Lake District Farlam Hall was once owned by a family that brought a donkey into the billiards room for entertainment on rainy-day birthdays! That comfortable informal country house atmosphere still reigns today under the management of the Quinion family who have owned Farlam since 1975. There are just 12 bedrooms each eclectically furnished with patterned wallpaper while the drawing rooms have original fireplaces. Meet there for drinks with the other guests before sitting down to dinner in this most English of manor houses. Try some country pursuits at Ballathie House Hotel Perth & Kinross Scotland This 19th-century house on the banks of the River Tay has a long and illustrious association with salmon fishing and country sports – attested to by the sporting prints and display cabinets showcasing ‘monster’ fishing trophies. The large estate which offers walking cycling clay pigeon shooting as well as the renowned fishing is close to some of Scotland’s finest golf courses. Oh and by the way the Queen Mother came here for a house party in 1922..! Drink in the views at Bodysgallen Hall and Spa Conwy Wales Don’t be fooled by the name - Bodysgallen means ‘house among thistles’ - let’s put that down to characteristic British self-deprecation. The gardens here are manicured and a fitting backdrop to the 17th-century mansion the oldest part actually dates to the 13th century. The views are as exceptional as the hotel. Check into the Lady Augusta or Conwy suite and gaze out of stone-mullioned windows to the Snowdonia mountains and Conwy Castle. Check out VisitBritains stay at the hotel.

Along with the ships they buried many items for the afterlife food drink jewellery furniture carriages weapons and even a few dogs for companionship. Discovered in Oslofjord in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the ships and their wares are beautifully restored offering an evocative emotive insight into Viking life.

The most ostentatious and intimidating of the three is the Oseberg. The burial chamber beneath it held the largest collection of Viking-age artefacts ever uncovered in Scandinavia though it had been looted of its jewellery. As daunting as the ship appears it was probably only ever intended as a royal pleasure craft. The sturdier 24m-long Gokstad built around 890 is the finest remaining example of a Viking longship but when it was unearthed its corresponding burial chamber had also been looted and few artefacts were uncovered. There is also the third smaller boat the Tune which is fragmentary but what remains is incredibly well preserved.

Augsburg with its Mozart heritage is one of the most historically significant cities in Germany – not to mention one of the prettiest. As you stroll through the citys ancient streets it doesnt take much imagination to gain a sense of Augsburgs importance as a prominent financial centre international trading hub and focal point for the fine arts in the days when the Fugger banking empire was at its peak. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Augsburg shaped the history of Germany and Europe over a long period having always been a little richer and more glamorous and imposing than other cities. Augsburgs superb fountains grand old guildhouses exquisite churches and of course the Town Hall – perhaps one of the most important secular Renaissance buildings north of the Alps – combine to form a cityscape of rare intensity. More recent periods have also left their mark most notably the Baroque and Rococo eras and – much later – the art nouveau movement all of which turn a stroll through the city into a very special experience. Since as long ago as the High Middle Ages travellers have been marvelling at Augsburgs stately churches including the cathedral with its stunning bronze portal now nearly 1000 years old and the Basilica of St. Ulrich and St. Afra named after two patron saints of the city. Another marvel was the wealth of the Fugger dynasty which emerged as a powerhouse of capitalism in the space of just three generations. The Fuggers mercantile and banking empire stretched from the Adriatic up to the North Sea and from the Atlantic Ocean across to eastern Europe. Jakob Fugger and his brothers gave the city some of the earliest Renaissance buildings north of the Alps including the Fuggerei the worlds first social housing project and the Fugger chapel in St. Anna. Jakob Fugger soon gained a reputation as a man of unfathomable wealth though this paled in comparison with his nephews fortune Anton Fugger was considered the worlds richest man in the mid-16th century. For fear that this would make the city a likely target for attack Augsburg surrounded itself with extensive fortifications and a continuous city wall parts of which can still be seen today. Numerous gold and silversmiths settled within the city walls and over the centuries their guild established an excellent reputation. Their works are on display in various museums and exhibitions and are even sold in some of the many smaller stores still in existence today. There is a second family with close ties to the city the Mozarts. Leopold Mozart father to Wolfgang Amadeus and an influential composer in his own right was born here. The Augsburg Mozart Festival traditionally held every May not only focuses on famous works by the father and son composers but also offers a fascinating insight into their family friends fellow musicians rival composers and the period in which they lived. Another great event in Augsburg is the annual Brecht Festival a theatre festival in honour of the citys influential – if occasionally obstinate – son Bertolt Brecht. Even in the eyes of the locals the writer was for a long time a controversial and largely unpopular figure. However the people of Augsburg have since made their peace with him and have dedicated a fascinating exhibition to his memory in the house where he was born. Other museums in the city turn attention to different periods of history most notably the Schaezler Palais a highlight of the rococo with its four eminent art collections. The Museum of the Augsburger Puppenkiste puts the spotlight on this adorable string puppet theatre a fond childhood memory for generations of visitors. And in the evenings in one of the many cosy bars in the old town there will always be somebody who will happily discuss Augsburgs puppet theatre Brecht or Mozart at length. Or you might want to ask them about the eighth of August the worlds only state-approved public holiday to be celebrated in just one city. The occasion? Augsburgs High Peace Festival. read more » « less Highlights Handsome homes for the poor the Fuggerei » Industrial architecture and modern art » A world stage in miniature Augsburg puppet theatre » Jewish Culture Museum and Synagogue » The Golden Hall in Augsburg » The Cathedral of Augsburg » Related topics Museums Historic Highlights of Germany Discover more in the local region Skyline Park – reaching new heights » Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura » Nymphenburg Palace & Park.

Featuring eight lanes and three gates the settlement is known as a town within a town and comprises 67 two-storey houses and 147 apartments its own church fountains town walls and gates which are still closed every evening at 10pm by the nightwatchman. The annual basic rent for an apartment is to this day one Rhenish guilder – a nominal amount equivalent to just 88 euro cents. Find out more about TOP 100 Industrial architecture and modern art In addition to many places of historical interest Augsburg also boasts a wealth of contemporary attractions. The city has two outstanding modern art forums the State Gallery of Modern Art in the Glaspalast a light-filled building offering 1500m² of exhibition space and the H2 centre for contemporary art. Both bear the hallmark of modern industrial architecture and are located within close proximity of each other enabling visitors to embark on an in-depth journey of discovery through the world of modern painting. Find out more about Museums A world stage in miniature Augsburg puppet theatre Captivating audiences for generations the Augsburger Puppenkiste puppet theatre with its 6000 marionettes and more than 60 years of history is without doubt one of the most famous puppet theatres in existence today. The theatre has been delighting viewers of all ages since 1953 with its TV shows starring characters such as Luke the Engine Driver and his friend Jim Button from Lummerland Robber Hotzenplotz Urmel the Dinosaur Mikesch the Talking Tomcat Aladdin and his magic lamp and Mother Hulda not to mention Punch and Judy. What many people dont know is that the theatre also hosts puppet performances for grown-ups in the evening which have older audiences rolling in the aisles with their biting satire. Find out more about City-Highlights Jewish Culture Museum and Synagogue The museum has exhibitions on the history of the Jewish community in Augsburg and the rural Bavarian Swabia region and also contains religious and cultural artefacts. The museum is housed in the Augsburg Synagogue which was built between 1914 and 1917 and unites elements of art nouveau Byzantian and modernist styles. The building was badly damaged during the Night of Broken Glass in 1938 but was restored in 1985. Opening times Tuesday-Thursday 9am-6pm Friday 9am-4pm Sunday & public holidays 10am-5pm Find out more about Museums The Golden Hall in Augsburg With its rich gold-adorned ceremonial room in the Augsburg Town Hall the Golden Hall is regarded as one of the most important cultural icons of Germany’s Late Renaissance. The ceiling of the 14-metre-high hall is clad with gold foil. It was completely destroyed in 1944 and reinstated in 1996 after 17 years of restoration. Since then the Golden Hall is used as reception hall and meeting room for the city. Find out more about TOP 100 The Cathedral of Augsburg With its 62-metre-high towers and widely visible silhouette the mighty Cathedral of Augsburg belongs to Augsburg’s most-visited attractions. This place of worship consecrated in 807 has represented the spiritual centre of the city for over a millennium. In time it was expanded and rebuilt several times. Numerous treasures are stored within the church. Of special importance are the romantic windows of the Prophets from the oldest glass painting series in the world the illustrations by Hans Holbein the Elder the impressive bronze portal from the 11th century and the delicate southern portal to name a few.

Nowadays Amsterdam has plenty of excellent beer-related activities and places to visit. Take a tour of a former Heineken brewery where you can learn all about one of Holland’s most famous exports or explore the city’s thriving craft beer scene. There’s even a brewery in a windmill! And of course don’t forget to enjoy a small but refreshing glass of beer in one of Amsterdam’s many cute canal-side bars. Get to grips with Dutch beer culture. Learn more about the history of Heineken Holland’s most famous beer export. Visit a local brewery housed in a windmill. Amsterdam’s beer culture It is no exaggeration to say that Holland is a nation of beer drinkers. Walk along an Amsterdam canal on a summer’s evening and you’ll pass countless little cafés and bars where people are thoroughly enjoying their vaasje – a quarter-liter or roughly half-pint glass of lager. Brewing beer has a very long tradition in Holland beginning with monks in the middle ages and leading to famous brands such as Heineken Amstel and Grolsch. The Dutch even have their own version of craft beer. Speciaalbier or simply ‘special beer’ is often served from bottles and is usually much stronger – both in flavor and in alcohol content – than the standard lager. More Anglo-American styles of craft beer such as American Pale Ale are also widely available. Visit famous breweries in Amsterdam The most famous beer from Holland is undoubtedly Heineken and the Heineken Experience pulls out all the stops to cater to international visitors. Located in the first Heineken brewery to be built in Amsterdam’s De Pijp neighborhood this museum experience offers a self-guided interactive tour where visitors can learn about the history of the brand and the brewing process and of course enjoy a taster. Those who prefer their experience a bit smaller scale should opt for a visit to Brouwerij ’t IJ just east of the city center. The brewery produces various beers that are much revered throughout Holland and best of all it’s located in a towering windmill. Brouwerij ’t IJ offers tours but you can also just go and sample their wares in the cozy bar or on the spacious terrace. Independent craft breweries The global craft beer revolution hasn’t bypassed Amsterdam and noteworthy proponents that can be visited include Oedipus Brewing an arty industrial space north of the River IJ that offers live music to go alongside your beer sampling while Butcher’s Tears is a hip but dedicated craft beer brewery in the south of the city. Another great brewery to visit is De Prael an inclusive social enterprise serving delicious organic craft beer in laid-back cozy surroundings – plus they also host tours and tastings. And at the two locations of the popular Brouwerij Troost you can also indulge in some hearty food such as burgers. Please note that brewery tours typically only admit over-18s. Amsterdam boasts countless small breweries that produce specialty beers with dedication and expert craftsmanship. For an overview please go to the I Amsterdam breweries blog. More to tantalize your taste buds We always recommend you have some good hearty food alongside any Amsterdam beers. Dutch bar snacks are often deep-fried and always delicious. And later you could do worse than trying some traditional Dutch food for dinner. That should equip you for a pub tour taking in some of Amsterdam’s most atmospheric famous or infamous traditional bars. And just in case you’ve had enough beer you could always check out one of Amsterdam’s ‘best-of-both-worlds’ culinary concepts where you can combine for example mussels and gin or hot dogs and champagne.

Built between 1720 and 1744 and enhanced by the magnificent gardens between 1765 and 1780 it exemplifies a glittering era and is one of the most spectacular royal palaces in Europe. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The Würzburg court architect Balthasar Neumann who was given overall responsibility for the enormous construction project had an unenviable role. He had to keep many sensitive artists happy and motivated to give their best these included the leading architects of Germany and France such as Lucas von Hildebrandt Maximilian von Welsch Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand. The Italian Antonio Bossi a gifted decorative artist known as the ornamental genius of Würzburg Palace and star sculptors such as Johann Wolfgang van der Auvera and Georg Adam Guthmann from Munich were among those who worked on the detailed interior decor. And Giovanni Battista Tiepolo no less than the greatest fresco painter of the 18th century was responsible for the wall paintings. They all created timeless works of art in the vestibule staircase While Hall and Imperial Hall – the mirrored hall for example is for many the most perfect example of a room ensemble in the rococo style. Working in creative collaboration these artists of different nationality and language produced what became known as Würzburg rococo the most Italianate of all variations on this style in Germany. Also part of the UNESCO World Heritage site the court gardens are no less opulent in their beauty than the palace itself. Another highlight not to be missed in Würzburg from the Marienberg Citadel you can enjoy incredible panoramic views across the city and its wonderful surrounding countryside where the famous Franconian wine is produced. read more » « less Opening times tours and tips Opening times April to October 9am to 6pm ticket office closes at 5.30pm November to March 10am to 4.30pm ticket office closes at 4pm Open daily excluding 1 January Shrove Tuesday 24 25 and 31 December the gardens are open daily until dusk or 8pm.

These boltholes either have no electricity no roads or they’re remote enough to render ‘Do not disturb’ signs pointless. A cabin in a barley field East England View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sawdays Canopy & Stars @canopyandstars on Jul 22 2015 at 102pm PDT There’s no electricity to power this wooden cabin hidden amid crops of sugar beets and barley near the magical north Norfolk coast in the east of England. Candles and lanterns light up the cosy interior while moonlight stars and a fire pit illuminate the private deck. The Woodcock scores extra romance points for the lovingly handcrafted wooden king-sized bed locally sewn curtains hanging from a locally forged curtain rail and mismatched crockery sourced from local antique shops. Best of all is the huge bath warmed by a wood-fired heater. Alternatively if youre feeling brave there’s always the outdoor shower... A loch-side guesthouse Scottish Highlands View this post on Instagram A post shared by Skiary @skiary_scotland on Nov 14 2018 at 813am PST The all-inclusive Skiary Guesthouse is tucked away on the road-free shores of Loch Hourn. To reach ‘Scotland’s Wildest Guesthouse’ you can walk for 35 minutes from the end of the road or organise a ride in the owners’ little motorboat. Instead of electricity and mobile phones entertainment comes via board games home-cooked meals and good old-fashioned conversation. And whisky naturally. The whole place is lit by paraffin-fuelled lamps or candles and is warmed by a driftwood-burning stove. While you’re there drift across the loch in a rowing boat spot seals and red deer amble hand-in-hand along the loch-side paths or stretch your legs on a hill walk. A cliff-top lighthouse Shetland Islands Scotland View this post on Instagram A post shared by Darwin on the rocks @darwinontherocks on Feb 25 2018 at 112pm PST As an automated lighthouse Eshaness needs electricity but as far as location is concerned this place is seriously off-grid. It perches on the top of sheer cliffs on the western edge of the Shetland Islands the most northerly place in Britain at 962 miles north of London and 400 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Inside the lighthouse is warm and cosy but it’s the 360° views that make this place so romantic. There are no visible neighbours and the only noises you’ll hear are the powerful Atlantic waves pounding the cliffs below and the gannets and skuas soaring overhead. If you’re lucky you might spot whales breaching the endless sea. Hope for an almighty storm for an excuse to cuddle up even closer. An 18th-century retreat Wales View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ben @ben.forshaw on Jan 23 2016 at 808am PST Tune in to a simpler time in Bryn Eglur – a cute-as-a-button traditional Welsh smallholder’s cottage in a remote part of Wales. Built in 1775 the tiny rooms have been carefully restored with just a few subtle modern conveniences added such as a roll-top bath and underfloor heating after all it would be considerably less romantic without! Mobile phone reception is patchy at best and there’s no internet access. Instead you get Welsh wool blankets a grandfather clock and a wrought iron bedframe. Cook on a solid-fuel Rayburn stove cuddle up in front of the inglenook fireplace and fill your days with romantic walks and your nights with stargazing. Read our experience of a stay in the Welsh House. An island escape Southwest England View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bruce Taylor @roolerworks on Feb 24 2018 at 422am PST Admittedly bunk beds aren’t the most amorous of sleeping arrangements but this self-catering cottage’s romance factor is amped up by its location. Originally a signal-and-watch station for boats Tibbets occupies the second highest point on tiny Lundy Island just off the north coast of Devon. It’s one of a few places to stay on Lundy but timber-floored and matchboard-lined Tibbets is the most remote and the only one without electricity. Ramble the island’s rocky shores snorkel or scuba the clear waters of the Lundy Marine Conservation Zone spot puffins sika deer and Lundy ponies and try to count up to 14 lighthouses twinkling in the distance.

For our second installment we spoke with Virginia-native Connie Waters about her impromptu decision to move to London the romantic reason she stayed and the cultural differences she’s noticed as an expatriate. On relocating After graduating from college during the middle of the financial crisis in 2008 I came across an opportunity to move to London for a year-long internship program through the Mountbatten Institute. I love traveling and didnt have any real idea of what I wanted to do for a career so I decided to apply—and got it. During that year I met a great British guy named Ciaran. After returning back to the U.S. and dating long-distance for a bit I made the decision to move back to London. We’re now married. On finding the perfect place to live London has so many distinct neighbourhoods. Its one city but it feels like dozens of little villages all jammed next to each other. Each part of the city has its own character and sense of community. We live in Fulham which is a part of west London. It feels really residential and neighbourhood-y but it’s also walking-distance from plenty of restaurants bars cafes shopping and parks—and is easily accessible to everything in central London. On housing design London is full of period properties from various eras which have more character than you’ll typically see in many American cities. Its common to find a single-family home from 100 years ago split into multiple flats. It’s also very typical for flats not to have any closet space at all – freestanding wardrobes are needed instead. While most flats do have a washer/dryer they’re a lot smaller than the ones you’d find in the U.S. and they’re often located in the kitchen. On using British phrases A lot of British-isms have crept into my vocabulary over the last few years—mostly at work. Now I say lift for elevator diary for calendar and holiday for vacation. Ive also started saying quite and a bit a lot more often too. On staying active Londoners walk a lot! It is a very easy city for pedestrians and many people I know even walk to work. I’m a big fan of Triyoga which has a few locations around London but I prefer the Chelsea studio. My colleague recently told me about a group exercise class called Bounce where you jump around on a trampoline. Apparently it’s really hard! There’s also a running path along the Thames in southwest London—and lots of races to take part in all year long. The Royal Parks Half Marathon is a great because it goes through four of the citys royal parks and past lots of famous monuments. On pub culture In London pubs aren’t just for adults looking for a night out on the town. Going to a pub for a family lunch is just as acceptable and common as going to a pub for after-work drinks or the big game. There’s also a rounds” etiquette where everyone in the group takes turns buying a round of drinks for the table as opposed to people buying individual drinks for themselves. One of my favorite things about British pubs is that you’re allowed to take your drink with you outside. When the weather is nice there’s always a large crowd of people drinking outdoors. Plus a lot of the pubs have great beer gardens. The bars in Broadgate Circle or around Leadenhall Market are always great spots for after-work drinks. On local cuisine Ive definitely started eating fish and chips more since I moved to London. And it may sound weird but its the condiments that Ive really gotten into! There are some foods now that I cannot even eat without Brown sauce Colmans mustard or Pizza Express salad dressing. I love the diversity of London’s food scene. You can find the best food from every country all over the world including Indian Lebanese Spanish and Southeast Asian. Although the portion sizes are smaller in London than the US if you dont finish your meal its awkward to ask to take home leftover food. Most restaurants dont do that—and will look at you strangely for asking! On date nights My husband and I go on a lot of dinner dates because we have a long list of restaurants that we want to try! But we keep coming back to The Sands End in Fulham—it’s a great gastro pub in our neighborhood with seasonal food and real cask ales. They’re famous for their homemade Scotch eggs and serve them all day long. On the social nature of tea People dont just drink tea just for an afternoon pick-me-up… its more of a social thing here. Whenever you visit someones home theyll offer you a cup as soon as you walk in the door and at work its an excuse to take 10 minutes out of the day to chat. While some people like sugar and others dont I dont think Ive ever seen a British person drink a cup of tea without milk. On must-visit attractions London can be so big and overwhelming especially for first-time visitors. I recommend going somewhere that offers a view of the entire city just to see how it all pieces together. It’s hard to get a feel for where everything is when you’re just traveling around underground! City Social at the top of Tower 42 Sushisamba at the top of Heron Tower Sky Garden and Aqua Shard are all great cocktail bars with awesome cityscape views. You can also see a beautiful view of the city from Hampstead Heath in north London if you’d rather be outdoors! On new holiday traditions Every November 5th our friends host a big bonfire party to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night. It feels like the closest thing to a UK Independence Day. There are fireworks a bonfire and lots of food and drinks. On regional travel My husband lived in Brighton for many years and still has lots of friends there so Ive been fortunate to visit there many times. Its a seaside town with a pebble beach and lots of little streets with good cafes and shops. The Brighton Pavilion is definitely worth checking out too. I also really like Cambridge—it’s a beautiful old little city with so much culture. The Cambridge colleges are interesting to explore – but the must-do attraction is punting up and down the Cam River by yourself or with the help of a guide. However my all-time favorite UK destination is the Lake District. It’s absolutely stunning and a paradise for nature lovers. On getting away from it all Every once in a while my husband and I like to leave London for a night to explore somewhere new and take break from the city. Sometimes we’ll visit my husbands family in Wiltshire or as a bit of a splurge and because of the novelty of it! we’ll book a room at one the historic castles and buildings that are abundant across the UK. Most of them have on-site restaurants and are in the most charming little villages. Some of our favorite stays have been in Amberley Castle in Sussex Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire and the Manor House in Castle Coombe.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Innsbruck - attractions with dogs Innsbruck - attractions with dogs Innsbruck was waiting for us covered in dark clouds but this didn’t bring us down. Hostel Jugendherberge Innsbruck on Reichenauerstrasse wasn’t hard to find it lies not far from the motorway. It’s also close enough to walk to the city centre. This won’t be necessary told us the nice receptionist as the bus station is right in front of the hostel. A bus with a mark O drives to the city centre. So we said goodbye to the car for a few days and left it at the hostel’s parking lot. Hostel is also pet friendly and that is the main reason why we chose it. It has perfect location to take a walk with a dog. Behind the hostel is the Inn river and a cycling and walking path runs next to it. You can take this path to the city centre and be there in a little less than an hour. We got the room in the first floor with two bunk beds and a river view. It has an interesting solution of a private bathroom. It’s not in the room but only a step away in the opposite side of the hallway. A big lobby is inviting you with comfortable sofas and free wi-fi. You can also hang out play a board game watch TV in the smaller room with a library or at a nearby garden with a few tables. Laundry room kitchen and luggage room can also be useful for someone. The breakfast room isn’t very big but it is very well organized so it doesn’t get crowded. The offer is diverse so everyone finds something for themselves. The hostel is popular throughout the year so the reservation is recommended. There’s a food store nearby and also the biggest shopping centre in Innsbruck. City temptations The capital of the Austrian state Tirol is one of the most beautiful Alpine cities and one of the most visited cities in Austria which we quickly realised in the city centre. Here you can see city hall arch of triumph dedicated to Maria Theresa churches and museums. Goldenes Dachl Golden Roof is getting special attention. It got the name after the roof above the balcony which was built for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I so he could watch the events on the main square in every weather. Around the square you will find halls with many stores and restaurants. You can not be hungry in Innsbruck there are so many choices and they’re not all expensive. We were searching for something sweet and were amazed by a little confectionery which offered strudel. But they didn’t offer only apfel strudel apple strudel there were about 10 different kinds and unfortunately we couldn’t try them all. There also wasn’t enough time to get the famous Sacher cake which is as popular and at home here as in Vienna. In 1999 they opened the prestigious coffee shop Sacher where it’s always crowded despite the steep prices. A lot of times there’s a line before the coffee shop and people wait for the free table. Sacher cake was created in 1832 by 16-year-old Franz Sacher. The recipe still remains a family secret. Well everyone knows there’s an apricot jam in the chocolate cake but the magic is in the details. In Austria they make at least 1000 Sacher cakes per day. And the cake is even more delicious with cream and coffee or tea. In Christmas time Innsbruck also lives the holiday magic. Stalls are set up on the main shopping street Maria-Theresien Strasse at the end of November and are set up till the 6th of January. Of course you can’t skip mulled wine or punch. Sports Paradise The city got its name after many bridges that cross the river Inn some of them are true architectural masterpieces. An architectural masterpiece is also the funicular that drives partially under ground and rises 300 metres above the city to Hungerburg. The funicular was projected by the famous architect Zaha Hadid and the ride is a special event. From the upper station you can continue your way with a gondola which takes you all the way to the mountain Hafelekar 2256 metres. There’s also a ski slope with one of the steepest tracks in Europe. Taking a gondola makes sense in nice weather otherwise you will only admire clouds and fog. Innsbruck hosted Olympic games twice in 1964 and in 1976. The most famous inheritance of the Olympic games is the ski jump Bergisel. Four Hills Tournament takes place here every year. It was updated in 2003 and is definitely worth a visit. It lies just above the city and the view from the panoramic restaurant is amazing. You can get to the top by an elevator or by funicular. You can watch the spectacular jumps all the time he jumpers fly into the valley a few times a day. Innsbruck is first class sports city where you can try a lot. You can go rafting tour ski or paraglide. The ski slopes are located near the city and about 40 kilometres away there’s the biggest Austrian glacier Stubai where you can ski from October to July. The city is also on the crossroad between Italy and Germany. Less than an hour away is the German ski centre Garmisch-Partenkirchen. You can also take an unusual trip not far away. You will find the Swarovski crystal factory in Wattens and a combination of a theme park modern art gallery a store and much more is inviting the visitors to the Swarovski Crystal Worlds. It might be more suitable for women. But it’s definitely very popular and I recommend you to come early around 10 a.m. when they open it. There’s a regular bus from Innsbruck and it’s another reason to purchase the Innsbruck city card. You will be able to enter most of the city attractions with the card and you also get the access to public transport with all the gondolas and funiculars.

Now museums sites and memorials punctuate the region which is indissociable from this historical epoch. Lets experience the trenches through the eyes of the poilus—the infantry soldiers of the French army. Tread the battlefield © B. Mankin-French/CRT Lorraine There is hardly time to dump your suitcases in Verdun before going to the national forest located at the gates of the city. Created after the war on the old battlefield it had the difficult task of healing this wounded land. Covering almost 10000 km2 25000 acres this forest is an authentic open-air museum with no less than 80 historical monuments from the Great War or built in memory of the combatants. Wear the uniform © Jean-Marie Mangeot If you only can visit one site it should definitely be this one. Desired by the Verdun veterans entirely renovated and expanded in 2016 the memorial puts visitors in the soldiers shoes. You can feel and understand this battle in the exact same place where it took place a century ago. On the last floor you cannot miss the spectacular view of the forest. Mémorial de Verdun External link Mourn in Douaumont © CRT Lorraine The visit of the forest continues at the fort of Douaumont. The most powerful building of the stronghold the fort is the symbol of Verdun taken by the Germans only few days after the beginning of the battle. Not far from there the Ossuary of Douaumont pays tribute to the French and German soldiers who gave their lives on the battlefield. Fort of Douaumont External link Ossuary of Douaumont External link Dine at the canteen © Les Jardins du Mess The immersion continues in Verdun where you can spend the night in the former officers mess. Located on the banks of the Meuse river in a 19th century building this older military canteen is now a 4-star hotel called les Jardins du Mess. You can enjoy the wellness space and its table the Mess Circle in order to build up strength after a trying first day of discovery. Hotel Les Jardins du Mess External link Go underground © CDT Meuse - Michel Petit The day begins below the lands surface at the underground Citadel of Verdun. Lets embark in the pod with an audio guide to experience the activity of the logitics base where the Poilus coming back from the battle line crossed paths with those who were about to fight. Citadelle souterraine de Verdun External link Broaden your horizons © CDT Meuse/Michel Petit Back to fresh air! Lets go to the Centre mondial de la Paix where the exhibition Que reste-t-il de la Grande Guerre ?” What is left of WWI? takes place until the end of the year in the Verdun city center. There is an opening to the 20th century to understand the aftermath of this worldwide conflict better. Centre mondial de la Paix External link Storm the fortress © B. Mankin-French/CRT Lorraine A few kilometers from Verdun the Ouvrage de la Falouse stood against the bombings. You can still find the towers that hosted the machine guns some canons as well as an infantry section. The life behind the battle line is also rebuilt in a 150-meter 500-foot long trench. Ouvrage de la Falouse External link End on a sweet note © CRT Lorraine You cant leave this region without visiting the boutique La Dragée de Verdun. The Braquier House the factory which was destroyed during the battle of Verdun has produced the dragée candies since 1783.

Latest information on COVID-19 and travel to the UK Experience a real medieval banquet! Tuesday 10 April 2018 Courtiers court jesters and a whole lot of good cheer. We spent the night at a historic hotel just over 30 minutes south of Birmingham which was once an abbey and then childhood home to ‘The Winter Queen’ – Elizabeth Stuart of Bohemia – to experience a dinner party 16th-century style… ‘Huzzah!’ We all jeer knocking back our first beaker of mead. It’s super sweet much as you might expect alcoholic honey to taste. My boyfriend Tom and I are at Coombe Abbey a short drive north from both Warwick Castle and Shakespeares birthplace Stratford-upon-Avon for one of their much-lauded medieval banquets which have been running for 40 years. As a history-geek at heart I’ve wanted to go to one for ages – it’s a chance to play time traveller. I’m not sure what our Tudor ancestors would have made of my costume though. I’m dressed as ‘Knight Linda’ – in an indigo tunic emblazoned with a red velvet lion and thick black tights wielding a plastic sword. To top it all off I’ve got a silver-sequinned handbag a cursory nod to real chainmail. Tom’s opted for a sinister-looking brown monk’s robe complete with oversized hood and wooden cross. In the Court of Coombe I notice authenticity is taken to varying degrees of seriousness. I spot one couple in full Tudor finery a robust Henry VIII in white hose with presumably one of his 6 wives who is gliding around in a bejewelled crimson gown. Then there’s a big group of guys in dodgy wigs - one looking ludicrous on a child’s hobby horse. Another man has got the wrong era entirely and is jovially sporting a Viking horned helmet. We’re seated on long benches illuminated by flickering candlelight as they would have been at the abbey back in 1539 when and this evening’s folly begins. The Abbot has invited the local peasants – us – for a feast. We’re a lively crowd fuelled by a couple of ales in the Hairy Monk Tavern beforehand but we calm down quickly in anticipation of feeding detecting the comforting aroma of a hearty broth wafting in from the kitchen. The procession of servers cast shadows with their hooded cloaks as they enter the dining hall Gregorian chants echoing in their wake. Heads down they pour out small bowls of steaming leek and potato pottage which are passed down the rows and eagerly drunk. We’re soon introduced to the de Clapper family who announce the year is 1595 and following the dissolution of the monastery they have taken up residence at Coombe Abbey. Sir Robin delights in informing us we’ve had a status upgrade – we are now his noble guests. True to the era we’re not given forks for the feast – they’ve not been invented yet. So we’re left to tuck in with our hands with just a knife to cut food into manageable chunks. It’s intimidating at first but when the pork ribs arrive delivered by a coterie of buxom wenches we find we need no encouragement to get stuck in. To clean up we just wipe our sticky fingers on the white towelling bibs that have been tied around our necks. By the time the main course is wheeled out – a quarter roasted fowl – the revelry is well under way. We link arms with those next to us for a bawdy ballad or 2 led by Sir Robin. ‘Huzzah!’ Then suddenly the banquet comes to a halt. ‘The PLAGUE has come!’ cries our host from on stage. Fortunately a cup-bearer is on hand with more wine to help soften the blow. Until that is we’re swiftly dealt another blow… ‘We are now at WAR!’ declares Sir Robin. Even his cap woven from cloth of gold is visibly shaken. He rallies the troops and aided by his brother the drunken Sir Nicholas his mother the dowager Lady Ethel and his niece the flirtatious Frances... Somehow amid much hi-jinks they manage to save the day. Eventually partied out we stumble back to our bedchamber. Our regal-looking room with a sumptuous bed on a raised platform is in the oldest part of the building and overlooks the moat. Outside snow has begun to fall dusting a certain magic on the scene. We stick our heads out of the window to admire it. Ancient trees line the driveway which cuts through the abbey’s acres of parkland its resident deer cloaked in darkness. For a moment I can almost picture Sir Robin and his merry band of men on horseback disappearing into the night… Latest Blogs Foodie map of Britain Foodie map of Britain Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Top 10 Events in Wales for 2020 Take on Britains best cycling routes Take on Britains best cycling routes Exploring Brent – Londons next Borough of Culture Exploring Brent – Londons next Borough of Culture 48 hours in Leeds 48 hours in Leeds Stay up to date Email Subscribe Find us on Facebook Twitter Instagram OUR WEBSITE Terms of use Sitemap Cookies Privacy Policy General Competition Terms and Conditions Accessibility statement User Generated Content Terms of Use Our other sites CorporateTradeBusiness EventsSelect languageMedia © 2020 VisitBritain.

Together with the Bohemian Forest National Park adjoining it to the east the Bavarian Forest National Park is the largest unbroken area of protected forest in central Europe. The philosophy of the National Park is to leave nature be borne out by giving it free and unrestricted reign and leaving it entirely to its own devices. More than 300 km of clearly marked footpaths almost 200 km of cycle routes and some 80 km of cross-country ski trails offer visitors plenty of opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the national park for themselves both in summer and in winter. There is such a lot to discover on a journey through this unspoilt highland region 95 per cent of which is covered by forest from mysterious moorland and crystal-clear mountain streams to Lake Rachelsee the national parks only glacial lake. Other attractions include a number of themed trails such as the Watzlik-Hain Schachten & Filze and Seelensteig trails trail networks like Lusenwandergebiet and Felswandergebiet and the ancient woodlands of Rachel-Falkenstein. A rather harsh continental climate long snowy winters and substantial differences in altitude 600 m to 1453 m provide perfect conditions for indigenous species including eagle owls Ural owls ravens otters wood grouse hazel grouse and three-toed woodpeckers. You can see many of these animals in the wildlife enclosure near Neuschönau. The forest play area and the wilderness camp on Mount Falkenstein the only one of its kind in Europe offer children and young people unforgettable experiences in an unspoilt wilderness. You can find out more about the history of the Bavarian Forest National Park including plenty of fascinating facts and figures at the St. Oswald Museum and the Hans-Eisenmann-Haus information centre near Neuschönau. read more » « less Related topics Cycling Walking Nature & technology www.nationalpark-bayerischer-wald.de Copyrights Home ms TOP 100 content Bavarian Forest National Park top of page Search at germany.travel Discover Destination Germany with our interactive map 0 My travel planner Site map | Legal notice Data protection Search at germany.travel Find us on Facebook Find us on Twitter Find us on Instagram Find us on YouTube Scan the Snapcode with your mobile device and find us on Snapchat E-Mail Newsletter Thank you!

Lifestyle joie de vivre or lebensart – whatever you call it Munich has it in spades. It might be down to the clear blue skies or simply the citys beauty but one things for certain the people of Munich always like to show their best side whether theyre in a beer garden on one of the exclusive shopping streets or in Bayern Munichs stadium. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner A modern cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage as suave as it is easygoing buzzing and yet tranquil. Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital. You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich but it doesnt hurt. Besides these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions. Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. That said undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square – it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls. The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the Hofbräuhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around. Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses. Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market – from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies. But take note bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle – so dont be tempted to try least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse Maximilianstrasse Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal. Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques. For a far more affordable not to mention more relaxed shopping experience head to Munichs pub and club quarter which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district but also extends around Glockenbachviertel Gärtnerplatz square and Müllerstrasse. The area is as renowned for its party atmosphere as it is for its alternative shops its relaxed atmosphere and its vibrant LGBT scene. A trip to the English Garden doesnt cost you a penny and Munichs very own piece of paradise situated between the Isar and the city centre is the ultimate chill-out zone. From lazing around or watching people master the latest craze of slacklining better still have a go yourself to the insane fun of surfing the Eisbach river anything goes in the park. Add to that two of Munichs most beautiful beer gardens one at the Chinese Pagoda the other at a picturesque lakeside spot and youve got the perfect recipe for a relaxing afternoon. These are the beer gardens where youll find an eclectic crowd who live life to the full in the shade of ancient chestnut trees. Thats the Munich way. The beer gardens came to be called cellars or keller – as in Salvatorkeller Löwenbräukeller and Hofbräukeller – because brewers once kept their beer underground to keep it cool and soon hit upon the idea of selling it from the very same spot. This was the start of a sacred tradition that as luck would have it is alive and well among locals today. The people of Munich are also proud of the citys museums many of which are of international standing such as the Deutsches Museum the worlds biggest science and technology museum the Alte Pinakothek the Neue Pinakothek the Pinakothek der Moderne and the Lenbachhaus Museum. Then theres the Glyptothek Museum the State Collections of Antiques and the Brandhorst Museum with its breathtaking collection of modern art from 1945 onwards. Here in Munichs Art Quarter however youll also find charming little bars cosy cafés and pretty boutiques yet another example of how the Munich lifestyle combines culture with the finer things in life. The BMW Museum has the citys automotive heritage covered while the stars of Bayern Munich show teams visiting the Allianz Arena another side to the citys unique lifestyle what its like to always be on top. Even if youre not a Bayern Munich fan its still well worth trying to get a ticket to see them play. The stadium atmosphere alone is world-class and guaranteed to give you goosebumps. And you wont be surprised to discover that the Allianz Arena is one of the worlds most spectacular stadiums. It is after all in Munich. read more » « less Highlights Bavaria Filmstadt  the kingdom of illusions » Allianz Arena Home advantage » Munich Pinakotheken galleries a world of art in Maxvorstadt » English Garden Munich a haven of relaxation in the big city » Marienplatz  Munichs magnificent main square » The Hofbräuhaus beer hall the measure of Munich » The ancestral home of the Bavarian rulers the Wittelsbach residence » Pure driving pleasure BMW Welt » Fatherly pride Nymphenburg Palace » A beer festival for the world Oktoberfest » A gourmets paradise the Viktualienmarkt food market » 24-hour party people Glockenbachviertel and Gärtnerplatz » Identity and culture the Jewish Museum » Century-defining works the Brandhorst Museum » The Olympic Park » German Museum » Lenbachhaus » Alte Pinakothek » Neue Pinakothek » Haus der Kunst » Munich Residenz » Munich Frauenkirche — The Cathedral of Our Dear Lady » Related topics Museums Traditions and customs Shopping Discover more in the local region Nymphenburg Palace & Park.

Dating back to 1822 the single lane mountain pass weaves its way through the Applecross peninsula.

Or camp out as wild camping is allowed in Scotland provided that you leave no trace. Its best to book your accommodation in advance especially if youre visiting during the summer.

Using buzzing capital city Cardiff as a springboard you can do a Welsh circuit - roughly 500 miles - in about five days. Enjoy endlessly stunning window views of coast countryside and castles there are more fortresses here per capita than anywhere else on earth then pull over to enjoy a raft of quirky activities designed to raise pulses and smiles. A post shared by Visit Wales @visitwales on Apr 13 2017 at 1007am PDT Once synonymous with its mining and farming industries Wales has become one of Europes adventure hubs and in Pembrokeshire a ruggedly pretty county 150km west of Cardiff you should try the eclectic past-time of coasteering. As the locals will tell you its basically an excuse to do everything your parents told you not to do when you were growing up think rock climbing cliff jumping swimming into sea caves and being flushed around in turbulent natural wave pools nicknamed The Toilet and The Washing Machine. A post shared by Visit Pembrokeshire @visitpembrokeshire on Apr 4 2017 at 123pm PDT Another region guaranteed to get the adrenaline flowing is Snowdonia National Park. Sprawling across north Wales its a dramatic expanse of verdant valleys lakes and mountains including Snowdon at 1085m Wales loftiest peak. You can scale the summit in about four hours on foot though a quicker and easier way up is on a narrow-gauge railway thats been running since 1896. A post shared by Visit Wales @visitwales on May 19 2017 at 1032am PDT For something truly surreal check out Surf Snowdonia. Both novice and expert surfers catch waves generated by a machine in this artificial lagoon built over a former aluminium factory site. Ziplining is another big Snowdonia draw with a cluster of venues letting you whoosh through disused slate caverns and over abandoned quarries. One of the most popular sites Zip World Velocity situated 20km from mighty Caernarfon Castle boasts the worlds fastest zip line you can reach speeds of up to 150km/h here. A post shared by Zip World @zip_world on May 14 2017 at 702am PDT Driving leisurely back towards Cardiff past rolling green landscapes you might fancy a pit stop in the village of Llanwrtyd Wells – especially if youre here in August when the World Bogsnorkelling Championships are held in a peat bog. A bit further south the Brecon Beacons await. Mountain biking horse riding and whitewater rafting are among the outdoorsy fun and games in this unspoilt national park near the Wales-England border. Another fantastic aspect to road-tripping in Wales is the memorable accommodation en route. You can sleep in everything from stately mansions - dont miss Nanteos a Grade I listed country house hotel near the seaside university town of Aberystwyth - to glamping-style pop-ups infused with Welsh myths and legends. This northern summer June-September you can stay in for example a Dragons Eye pod in Snowdonia or a funky slate cabin in west Wales. Dragons Eye Pod Photo © Epic Retreats Did you know? Welsh chefs are big on fresh regionally-sourced produce from land and sea and in the countrys cafes gourmet restaurants and gastropubs you can expect to feast on the likes of tender Welsh mountain lamb and dry-aged black beef and hand-dived scallops hake and oysters.

Around one million visitors come here every year from all over the world – to look marvel pray attend services enjoy the summer concerts and of course for quiet contemplation. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The statue of the Scourged Saviour was erected in 1730 for a pilgrimage but was subsequently put into storage in an attic. In 1738 the peasant woman Maria Lory having retrieved the statue saw tears and drops of blood on the statue. The news quickly spread more and more pilgrims came and soon the wooden village chapel built in 1740 was no longer enough to accommodate them all. The foundation stone for the current church was laid in 1746. Two brothers from neighbouring Wessobrunn were responsible for the realisation of this multifaceted work of art in the elaborately ornamental rococo style. The altarpiece is by the Munich court painter Balthasar August Albrecht while the statues of the four fathers of the western church – Jerome Ambrose Augustine and Gregory the Great – are the work of the Tyrolean sculptor Anton Sturm. The churchs exuberant interior decor is unparalleled in richness and refinement with opulent stucco ornamentation by Dominikus Zimmermann and ceiling frescoes painted by his brother Johann Baptist Zimmermann the court painter of the Bavarian Prince Elector. The gilded stucco garlands and the intricate trompe-lœil fresco on the dome ceiling are masterpieces of human creativity and a moving testament to a deeply-held faith. Master builder Dominikus Zimmermann remained closely associated with the Wieskirche in Bavaria until his death in a house he built himself which today serves as an inn.

And of course football fans will be overjoyed when visiting the hallowed grounds of Old Trafford and cheering Man U on as they practice. But Manchester is more than just music and sports. You’ll find great food spots popular hipster areas and cultural events taking place all the time. Whatever you’re after on your holiday Manchester has it! Daytime diversions It may seem a little odd but some of our favourite places to visit in Manchester are the libraries. For instance Chetham Library is the oldest English-speaking library in the world and looks like it was plucked right out of a Harry Potter film. Theres also The Central Library which was recently refurbished as well as the Victorian gothic John Rylands Library on Deansgate. Art lovers are spoiled for choice in Manchester. The Whitworth Gallery has an extensive textile collection dating back to 300AD and is located in one of the prettiest settings – Whitworth Park. Other notable galleries include The Lowry Gallery Oldham and Manchester Art Gallery. If you just want to wander take in the brilliant architecture and people-watch along the canals in Manchesters huge conservation area Castlefield. Here you can walk past big warehouses old mills and beautiful bridges – a nod to the citys important industrial past. Out and about The Northern Quarter is the place to go for shopping. Check out Manchester Craft and Design Centre where more than 30 designers sell their handmade work direct from their studios. Find more independent stores at HOME which boasts a theatre a cinema and a handful of restaurants. For the best burgers in town go to Almost Famous in the incredibly cool Northern Quarter. Head to Fress for brunch and then pop back in the evening for a cocktail. Find some time in your schedule to eat as many cronuts as is humanly possible at Albert Schloss and check out their burlesque shows every Tuesday evening. Food-loving travellers can’t miss Altrincham Market for all the best street food and local produce. The hotspot to be seen at night is 20 Stories located at the top of a high-rise building and boasting brilliant views over the entire city. For a laugh with cheap and honest drinks look no further than the Frog and Bucket comedy club. Stylish stays If you love a bit of glamour book a room at indie boutique Cow Hollow Hotel in the heart of the Northern Quarter. The rooms are modern without losing the charm of their restored Victorian textile factory setting. Indulge in the complimentary bubbly and snacks delivered to your door during ‘Prosecco Hour’. While Hotel Gotham is more reminiscent of the roaring 20s in NYC than modern day Manchester. Its rooms are decorated to mirror the era and create a luxurious feel. There’s even a rooftop bar and private members club looking over the impressive city skyline.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Melodious stopover in Salzburg Melodious stopover in Salzburg Salzburg which literally means salt fortress” got its name from its early salt exploitation which also constituted its main wealth. Located near the German frontier it is the fourth largest Austrian city and is probably one of the most charming places of the country. Nowadays the city is mostly known as the birthplace of 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart it is also a UNESCO world heritage site since 1997. On visit in Munich I decided to plan a one-day trip to Salzburg which is enough to discover the main sights and historical monuments the city has to offer. In this article you will discover what I consider as the highlights of the city complemented with some tips and practical information to make your stay even better. Accessibility and transportation Because of its central location it is possible to access Salzburg through different ways. On a national level it is easily accessible by car and train from Vienna. Within Europe it is well connected to Munich and Zurich especially by rail. However as a landlocked city with limited parking spaces private vehicular access is discouraged through cheap and simple alternatives. Salzburg is an eco-friendly city putting a lot of attention on both environmental protection and noise pollution. In this context the city launched an environmentally friendly bus system made of electric trolleybuses. The dense network covers numerous stops and buses run every 10 minutes during the daytime. It is thus simple and easy to access the city from the airport within 4 kilometers from the city-center or from the train station 15-minute walk. Special tip if you arrive by car I would very much advise to park in one of the Park & Ride P+R parking lots on the outskirts of the city which offer a total of 1100 spaces. Apart from being practical it is also the cheapest way to get around. In fact the price 15 EUR includes the parking space and a daily-unlimited bus ticket. What to do? What to see? Despite the small size of the city it offers countless opportunities whether you are a history buff an architectural amateur or a classical music listener. In fact as a result of its history and the ones who shaped it Salzburg reveals its multifaceted aspects as you walk through it. The tour begins with Hohensalzburg Fortress the largest completely preserved castle of Central Europe whose first traces go back to 1077. It was originally built both to guarantee the safety of the archbishops but also served as barracks and a prison. Since 1892 it is accessible to the public throughout the year offering numerous opportunities and ticketing options. From the guided tour with an audio-guide to attending events like the Fortress Concert or simply admiring the stunning 360-degree view on the city and its surroundings it is definitely a must-see in spite of the somewhat high prices. Accessibility It can be easily accessed by foot or by using the Salzburg Fortress Funicular in Festungsgasse. Special tip If you plan to visit most of the touristic attractions I warmly recommend to opt for the Salzburg Card available for 24 48 or 72 hours. After this enriching visit the next stop on the list was Mozart’s birth house known as Mozart’s Geburtshaus”. Salzburg’s Wunderkind” was born there in 1756 and lived there until 1773. This now world-known museum attracts thousands of tourists from all around the world. And for a good reason even though one is not a fan of classical music there is no denying that this place makes one shiver. While wandering through the original rooms where Mozart first saw the day of the light you have the unique opportunity to contemplate valuable artifacts such as historical instruments e.g. Mozart’s childhood violin mementos and letters written by Mozart’s hand and even more surprising a sample of the virtuoso’s hair. Special tip In addition to Mozart’s Geburtshaus and if you want to prolong the pleasure you can also visit Mozart’s Wohnhaus known as Tanzmeisterhaus” just across the river where he and his family moved in 1773. You will probably notice that the city is largely marked by a baroque style under the influence of an important Prince Archbishop which it deserves the surname of The Baroque City. The greatest expression of the baroque nature of Salzburg and an insight into the former archiepiscopal power is undoubtedly the DomQuartier. This complex of 15.000 square meters consists of palaces cathedrals and an Abbey for which the public access was prohibited for 200 years. There you will be able to enjoy the stunning Residence State Rooms its gallery the Cathedral Museum and many more. Special tip If you are not that convinced by the greatness of this place stop at least by the Salzburg Cathedral which is considered as the spiritual center of the city. Still not impressed? Heading towards the next stop across the river you can simply enjoy the beauty and the charm Salzburg’s streets. The most famous one remains Getreidegasse. It is the best-known shopping street but derives its uniqueness and originality from its numerous interior alleys inner courtyards and other curiosities you should discover by yourself! Special tip Lose yourself in one those tiny alleys and try to find this secret treasure shown below. One hint it is close to Mozart’s Geburtshaus… After this short break cross one of the bridges and make a last stop at the baroque Mirabell Palace and Garden in the heart of the city. There you will enjoy the visual orientation towards the DomQuartier and the Fortress offering a last overall historical view of the city before leaving. There you can recharge your batteries by rambling through The Rose Garden or The Orangery constitutive of this rich array of floral ornamentation typical of baroque gardens. Where to eat and delicacies You shouldn’t discover Salzburg without tasting one of the main celebrities of the city the Mozartkugel produced since 1884 by Fürst manufactory? Since then many manufacturers and brands try to imitate the original recipe and mislead unwise visitors. You don’t want to be one of those? Then you are lucky because here are the four shops where the original Mozartkugeln are sold next to the Mirabell Palace at the old market in the Getreidegasse and at Ritzerboden. Aside from this famous sugar refinery I recommend the Gasthaus Wilder Mann to all those who want to taste some traditional Austrian cuisine with a good quality-price ratio approximately 10 EUR on average for main course. Where to find it Getreidegasse 20 5020 Salzburg It is obvious that Salzburg has far more to offer and this article only presents the top-attractions and the must-see” sights for short-term visitors. In my perspective the most impressing remains the contrast between the relaxing atmosphere emanating from the streets and the splendor and the grandiosity of the architecture. This city will thus stay in my mind as a mix of romanticism and power charming and hypnotic all at once!

Augsburg with its Mozart heritage is one of the most historically significant cities in Germany – not to mention one of the prettiest. As you stroll through the citys ancient streets it doesnt take much imagination to gain a sense of Augsburgs importance as a prominent financial centre international trading hub and focal point for the fine arts in the days when the Fugger banking empire was at its peak. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Augsburg shaped the history of Germany and Europe over a long period having always been a little richer and more glamorous and imposing than other cities. Augsburgs superb fountains grand old guildhouses exquisite churches and of course the Town Hall – perhaps one of the most important secular Renaissance buildings north of the Alps – combine to form a cityscape of rare intensity. More recent periods have also left their mark most notably the Baroque and Rococo eras and – much later – the art nouveau movement all of which turn a stroll through the city into a very special experience. Since as long ago as the High Middle Ages travellers have been marvelling at Augsburgs stately churches including the cathedral with its stunning bronze portal now nearly 1000 years old and the Basilica of St. Ulrich and St. Afra named after two patron saints of the city. Another marvel was the wealth of the Fugger dynasty which emerged as a powerhouse of capitalism in the space of just three generations. The Fuggers mercantile and banking empire stretched from the Adriatic up to the North Sea and from the Atlantic Ocean across to eastern Europe. Jakob Fugger and his brothers gave the city some of the earliest Renaissance buildings north of the Alps including the Fuggerei the worlds first social housing project and the Fugger chapel in St. Anna. Jakob Fugger soon gained a reputation as a man of unfathomable wealth though this paled in comparison with his nephews fortune Anton Fugger was considered the worlds richest man in the mid-16th century. For fear that this would make the city a likely target for attack Augsburg surrounded itself with extensive fortifications and a continuous city wall parts of which can still be seen today. Numerous gold and silversmiths settled within the city walls and over the centuries their guild established an excellent reputation. Their works are on display in various museums and exhibitions and are even sold in some of the many smaller stores still in existence today. There is a second family with close ties to the city the Mozarts. Leopold Mozart father to Wolfgang Amadeus and an influential composer in his own right was born here. The Augsburg Mozart Festival traditionally held every May not only focuses on famous works by the father and son composers but also offers a fascinating insight into their family friends fellow musicians rival composers and the period in which they lived. Another great event in Augsburg is the annual Brecht Festival a theatre festival in honour of the citys influential – if occasionally obstinate – son Bertolt Brecht. Even in the eyes of the locals the writer was for a long time a controversial and largely unpopular figure. However the people of Augsburg have since made their peace with him and have dedicated a fascinating exhibition to his memory in the house where he was born. Other museums in the city turn attention to different periods of history most notably the Schaezler Palais a highlight of the rococo with its four eminent art collections. The Museum of the Augsburger Puppenkiste puts the spotlight on this adorable string puppet theatre a fond childhood memory for generations of visitors. And in the evenings in one of the many cosy bars in the old town there will always be somebody who will happily discuss Augsburgs puppet theatre Brecht or Mozart at length. Or you might want to ask them about the eighth of August the worlds only state-approved public holiday to be celebrated in just one city. The occasion? Augsburgs High Peace Festival. read more » « less Highlights Handsome homes for the poor the Fuggerei » Industrial architecture and modern art » A world stage in miniature Augsburg puppet theatre » Jewish Culture Museum and Synagogue » The Golden Hall in Augsburg » The Cathedral of Augsburg » Related topics Museums Historic Highlights of Germany Discover more in the local region Skyline Park – reaching new heights » Buchheim Museum of Imagination » Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura » Nymphenburg Palace & Park.

Hardworking honest but poor citizens were taken in and given fully furnished homes that even included cutlery. Featuring eight lanes and three gates the settlement is known as a town within a town and comprises 67 two-storey houses and 147 apartments its own church fountains town walls and gates which are still closed every evening at 10pm by the nightwatchman. The annual basic rent for an apartment is to this day one Rhenish guilder – a nominal amount equivalent to just 88 euro cents. Find out more about TOP 100 Industrial architecture and modern art In addition to many places of historical interest Augsburg also boasts a wealth of contemporary attractions. The city has two outstanding modern art forums the State Gallery of Modern Art in the Glaspalast a light-filled building offering 1500m² of exhibition space and the H2 centre for contemporary art. Both bear the hallmark of modern industrial architecture and are located within close proximity of each other enabling visitors to embark on an in-depth journey of discovery through the world of modern painting.

Since then the Golden Hall is used as reception hall and meeting room for the city.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Christmas Markets and Holiday Vienna Christmas Markets and Holiday Vienna Vienna in Christmas is one of the European cities that we simply must visit at least once. It is known for being beautifully decorated every year and that many stands and markets are just waiting for us to visit. We can’t just skip a cup of punch that we can order almost everywhere this time of the year. Christmas markets have long history that goes back in medieval times. First markets were mentioned in 14th century. In Vienna they were called December Markets and were mentioned in 1294. Markets offer Christmas cookies baked almonds mulled wine and egg punch. This year I was given the opportunity to visit Vienna. From the middle of November people can visit Christmas Vienna when the time comes that makes everything more beautiful and magical. It lasts until the end of advent. On many squares in Vienna we can find markets where we can buy Christmas deserts mulled wine punch or tea. On Mary-Therese Square Maria-Theresien Platz we can visit Christmas Village that is located between Natural History Museum and Art History Museum. The village is offering us handmade gifts that can be an inspiration for our own creativity or we can simply buy the presents and give something special and personal. We can also visit both museums that are also architectural beauties both built between 1872 and 1891. Natural History Museum is one of the most important museums in the world as collecting for the museum started 250 years ago. Today it offers more than 30 million exhibit pieces. The museums stand right next to each other and look almost the same. Not far away you can visit ‘’fairyland’’ on Rathausplatz where you can visit 150 stands that offer Christmas gift choices ornaments for a Christmas tree sweets or something to eat and drink to warm yourself in cold Vienna. The square is decorated with thousands of lights each street is decorated differently. City Hall is shining from all the lights and you can also have a look at the whole Vienna from the tower. City Hall was built between 1872 and 1883 and is currently being renovated. Across from it there is a huge park. You can also visit a theatre a parliament and a university from the square. There are also many street performers on the square and the most exciting thing – a 30 metre high Christmas tree that weighs 5 tons. In the square Stephansplatz there are also a lot of events. We can find a market and a big Christmas tree with many lights. Stephansplatz was named after one of the tallest churches in the world – Stephansdom that was recently renovated. We can also have a look on Christmas Vienna from the top of it there is also big Christmas crib inside. Across from Stephansdom there is a good example of modern architecture – Haas-Haus that gives a contrast between medieval and modern architecture. From the square we can go to a lot of shopping streets where you can buy ridiculously expensive tree ornaments or you can go Christmas shopping in one of the wallet-friendly stores. A big Christmas market is also near the Schönbrunn palace that was home to Habsburg emperors from 18th century until 1918. The palace is today under UNESCO. Choirs and musical groups sing Christmas songs in front of the palace as they have a stage right under the Christmas tree. They took care of the children also – there are many workshops organized for them where they can make gifts bake Christmas cookies and gingerbread biscuits. Tours and advent walks are also organized. The look of Christmas Schönbrunn is majestic the look from the hill will not disappoint. Christmas markets can be found on every square – Karlsplatz Riesenradplatz Belvedere Square and Spittelberg should not be left out. You can also find a Christmas market completely by accident if you walk around Vienna. It is a fact that Vienna is beautiful all year round but it is magical in Christmas time. Holiday spirit will not be possible to hide whether you’re an adult or a child. Visit hihostels.com to book hostels in Vienna.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Turracher Höhe Turracher Höhe In Nockberge mountains between Styria and Carinthia in Austria is Turracher Höhe which is famous for its ski slopes. There are ski slopes above the lake on the surrounding hills. In summer it is a perfect destination for hiking and for other activities. The idyllic mountains can be reached in only two hours. Winter joy in Turracher Höhe The ski slopes lie 2205 metres above the sea and have a snowy blanket throughout the whole winter. There are 14 funiculars and wide ski slopes which are never crowdy. Ski slopes have different difficulty levels so they are also appropriate for the beginners. You can also go cross-country skiing which aren’t easy because of the uneven terrain. Cross country skiing is recommended only to experienced skiers. Sledding is also a possible activity – there are special parts where sledding is allowed. Nockberg also offers off-piste skiing. Summer in idyllic mountain landscape There are many hiking paths you can choose from. There are easy and short and long and hard. But each hike will reward you with a beautiful view on the neighbouring hills and valleys. In the valley there is a lake Turracher See which can be admired from the neighbouring hills. In the winter the lake is icy so you can walk or skate on it. And in the summer it is perfect for walking around the lake or boat riding. If you’re not up for a hike you can go to the heart of the high hills with a funicular. In summer months you can walk around enjoy the beautiful nature and take your children with you as there are many playgrounds for them to have fun. When you step out of the funicular a wooden bunny will point your children in the right direction – to the playground. The playgrounds aren’t only on one point. They are all over the hill with a circular path which connects them. The playgrounds are very original and will entertain children of all ages. They will also entertain you. You can go back to the valley with a funicular or with sledge and bathe in the special pool in the lake. It looks like the pool is part of the lake but the water is heated so you can enjoy it the whole year. There are a lot of possibilities for activities in this wonderful nature which has always been an attraction – in the past people searched for gold in this area. While turning the big bowls watching the water pour away you will hope that there will be gold in the sand which will stay in the bowl. With a little luck you can also find a mineral. You simply have to spend at least a few days here so I would recommend nice hostel in Klagenfurt.

That’s why one of Micropia’s main aims is to establish a more positive view of microorganisms – including their role in daily life and how they can be utilised to improve our future. This modern museum perfectly caters to audiences with enquiring scientific minds as well as providing a fun introduction to this fascinating subject for kids in Amsterdam and their parents.

After all it was here in 1674 that Dutchman Antoni van Leeuwenhoek – the founding father of microbiology – became the first person to discover microorganisms. Situated right next to Artis Royal Zoo Micropia opened in 2014 with the core goal of filling the knowledge gap between the scientific community and the general public. In doing so it ignites inspiration in young and old showing visitors the positive relationships between themselves and microbes and changing the minds of even the staunchest germophobes.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Innsbruck - attractions with dogs Innsbruck - attractions with dogs Innsbruck was waiting for us covered in dark clouds but this didn’t bring us down. Hostel Jugendherberge Innsbruck on Reichenauerstrasse wasn’t hard to find it lies not far from the motorway. It’s also close enough to walk to the city centre. This won’t be necessary told us the nice receptionist as the bus station is right in front of the hostel. A bus with a mark O drives to the city centre. So we said goodbye to the car for a few days and left it at the hostel’s parking lot. Hostel is also pet friendly and that is the main reason why we chose it. It has perfect location to take a walk with a dog. Behind the hostel is the Inn river and a cycling and walking path runs next to it. You can take this path to the city centre and be there in a little less than an hour. We got the room in the first floor with two bunk beds and a river view. It has an interesting solution of a private bathroom. It’s not in the room but only a step away in the opposite side of the hallway. A big lobby is inviting you with comfortable sofas and free wi-fi. You can also hang out play a board game watch TV in the smaller room with a library or at a nearby garden with a few tables. Laundry room kitchen and luggage room can also be useful for someone. The breakfast room isn’t very big but it is very well organized so it doesn’t get crowded. The offer is diverse so everyone finds something for themselves. The hostel is popular throughout the year so the reservation is recommended. There’s a food store nearby and also the biggest shopping centre in Innsbruck. City temptations The capital of the Austrian state Tirol is one of the most beautiful Alpine cities and one of the most visited cities in Austria which we quickly realised in the city centre. Here you can see city hall arch of triumph dedicated to Maria Theresa churches and museums. Goldenes Dachl Golden Roof is getting special attention. It got the name after the roof above the balcony which was built for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I so he could watch the events on the main square in every weather. Around the square you will find halls with many stores and restaurants. You can not be hungry in Innsbruck there are so many choices and they’re not all expensive. We were searching for something sweet and were amazed by a little confectionery which offered strudel. But they didn’t offer only apfel strudel apple strudel there were about 10 different kinds and unfortunately we couldn’t try them all. There also wasn’t enough time to get the famous Sacher cake which is as popular and at home here as in Vienna. In 1999 they opened the prestigious coffee shop Sacher where it’s always crowded despite the steep prices. A lot of times there’s a line before the coffee shop and people wait for the free table. Sacher cake was created in 1832 by 16-year-old Franz Sacher. The recipe still remains a family secret. Well everyone knows there’s an apricot jam in the chocolate cake but the magic is in the details. In Austria they make at least 1000 Sacher cakes per day. And the cake is even more delicious with cream and coffee or tea. In Christmas time Innsbruck also lives the holiday magic. Stalls are set up on the main shopping street Maria-Theresien Strasse at the end of November and are set up till the 6th of January. Of course you can’t skip mulled wine or punch. Sports Paradise The city got its name after many bridges that cross the river Inn some of them are true architectural masterpieces. An architectural masterpiece is also the funicular that drives partially under ground and rises 300 metres above the city to Hungerburg. The funicular was projected by the famous architect Zaha Hadid and the ride is a special event. From the upper station you can continue your way with a gondola which takes you all the way to the mountain Hafelekar 2256 metres. There’s also a ski slope with one of the steepest tracks in Europe. Taking a gondola makes sense in nice weather otherwise you will only admire clouds and fog. Innsbruck hosted Olympic games twice in 1964 and in 1976. The most famous inheritance of the Olympic games is the ski jump Bergisel. Four Hills Tournament takes place here every year. It was updated in 2003 and is definitely worth a visit. It lies just above the city and the view from the panoramic restaurant is amazing. You can get to the top by an elevator or by funicular. You can watch the spectacular jumps all the time he jumpers fly into the valley a few times a day. Innsbruck is first class sports city where you can try a lot. You can go rafting tour ski or paraglide. The ski slopes are located near the city and about 40 kilometres away there’s the biggest Austrian glacier Stubai where you can ski from October to July. The city is also on the crossroad between Italy and Germany. Less than an hour away is the German ski centre Garmisch-Partenkirchen. You can also take an unusual trip not far away. You will find the Swarovski crystal factory in Wattens and a combination of a theme park modern art gallery a store and much more is inviting the visitors to the Swarovski Crystal Worlds. It might be more suitable for women. But it’s definitely very popular and I recommend you to come early around 10 a.m. when they open it. There’s a regular bus from Innsbruck and it’s another reason to purchase the Innsbruck city card. You will be able to enter most of the city attractions with the card and you also get the access to public transport with all the gondolas and funiculars.

Vienna is an expensive city everyone was saying to me when they heard that I’m going there for a student exchange. Why would I listen to them I thought quietly and was confident that my scholarship would be more than enough. It would last me at least two months in Maribor. Vienna definitely isn’t the cheapest city but it’s a city that charms you while walking through the city centre and definitely deserves the title of the city with the highest quality of life. U-Bahn and multiculturality The first fact that I quickly learned in Vienna is that you will probably hear some other language than German wherever you will be. Of course you will hear it in restaurants or shops but it will be more rare when you’ll walk through the city or drive with its underground. Vienna is a multicultural city where German isn’t a necessary language to get around but you will earn a smile or two for trying to squeeze out this Guten Tag” you’ve been practicing. If I already mentioned the underground or U-Bahn let me tell you that this really is the fastest and the cheapest option to get around and see all the sights. You can buy a one- two- or seven-day and so on which is really cheap for what you’re getting. With the ticket you can drive with U-Bahn or underground a tram or with a bus. They all drive very regularly the underground train comes every two to five minutes which means that you almost never wait for a train. If you’re from a small city where the buses leave every hour or two this is a big deal. But you soon get used to that and the next time you will find yourself waiting for a train for five minutes and you want to complain just remember your public transport at home. Coffee in the morning beer in the evening Even though Vienna is a big city there’s no rushing. Austrians will always take time for a cup of coffee and a pretzel in the morning or a beer I recommend Gösser in the evenings. Coffee shops are always full of people who watch people strolling by drink coffee and read the newspaper. Unesco even included Viennese coffee culture in cultural heritage in 2011. Turks introduced coffee to Viennese. Austrians beat Turks in 1683 and they left bags of coffee beans behind and introduced them this drink. The popularity of coffee has only been growing and now you can find coffee houses in Vienna that are up to 300 years old. One of the coffee houses with great history and tradition is Café Korb which was visited by Franz Josef in 1904 when it was opened. Viennese coffee houses helped Sigmund Freud Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt to its glory. Famous writers wrote their stories there and Strauss Mozart and Beethoven even played in coffee houses. Find a coffee house with history and tradition in Vienna don’t just go to Starbucks with wi-fi. Sit in a coffee house and enjoy the culture. And at night go to a pub. There’s a lot of true Austrian pubs but if you want some good music and atmosphere go to an Irish pub comfy sits and amazing atmosphere will wait for you at Golden Harp. Huge summer residences Of course you simply must visit at least one of the palaces in Vienna. Schönbrunn palace is a place where you will see flocks of tourists sighing at the beautiful architecture. The palace was only a summer residence of emperor family. It was built in 1642 but it was redesigned and renovated by Maria Theresa. Of course Schönbrunn is much more than just a building. It has an amazing park and the biggest gloriette in the world. And then there’s a zoo which was founded in 1752 and is the biggest zoo in the world you can even see pandas there which is quite rare. The second palace that is accessible by public transport is Belvedere Palace which was also a summer residence and is one of the most important baroque buildings in Austria. It consists of two buildings the Upper and Lower Belvedere. The Upper Belvedere will spoil you with the biggest collection of Klimt paintings. You can also see masterpieces of Schiel and Kokoschka but the entrance in this museum is enormous. Schnitzel or Bratwurst that is the question. Because you will probably get hungry while exploring all the attractions worth a visit are also Rathaus Museumsquartier Stephansdom parliament and Hofburg and you can see everything except Stephansdom on one stroll from the university to Hofburg I will also give you some advice on that area. I mentioned at the beginning that Vienna isn’t cheap and it’s the same with food but you can still get full for cheap. There’s a lot of possibilities for kebab or pizza slices but if you want something more local go get a bratwurst käsekreiner sausage with cheese and a piece of bread or something similar. Or get a wienerschnitzel. Everyone recommends the giant schnitzel” from Fieglmüller but if you’re on a budget try the schnitzel from Schnitzelwirt 52 where two can definitely get full from one portion especially if you’re a woman. Or try a giant pretzel which can be salty or sweet. Bon appétit! To stay on a budget book an accommodation at Briggitenau Youth Hostel which is a great starting point for visiting all the attractions and offers cosy and cheap rooms and even a breakfast for affordable prices. Vienna truly is an amazing city with lots of culture and everything else you could wish for.

What does Berlin have that other world cities dont? Well first of all theres the locals whose rough yet friendly charm is all part of the Berlin experience. Add to that an incredible array of sights that reflect not only the citys newfound swagger but also its great history and the dramatic events of the 20th century. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner When people think of Berlin the first thing that usually comes to mind is its most famous landmark – the Brandenburg Gate. For decades a symbol of division the monument has always been the beating heart of a major city bursting with ideas inspiration art culture and creativity. Highlights in the western parts of Berlin include the Kurfürstendamm as elegant a shopping street as youll find anywhere the Kaufhaus des Westens department store better known as KaDeWe on-trend boutiques and exclusive galleries as well as beautiful residential streets and of course Berlins famous nightlife. And speaking of nightlife no trip to Berlin would be complete without an evening at Friedrichstadt Palast Germanys leading variety theatre. The cosmopolitan vibe also permeates the government district which spreads out to the east from Brandenburg Gate and from the neighbouring Reichstag. Theres a sense of peace and freedom in the air here – in stark contrast to the days when Berlin was responsible for unthinkable crimes. The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe a work by New York architect Peter Eisenman located near the Brandenburg Gate serves as a reminder of those atrocities as does the Topography of Terror documentation centre at the former Gestapo headquarters. Berlins prestigious Unter den Linden boulevard extends eastwards from Brandenburg Gate towards Alexanderplatz square passing the Museum Island World Heritage site as well as Berlin Cathedral the Neue Wache and the baroque Zeughaus armoury which today houses the German Historical Museum. Keep going far enough and youll reach the TV tower which to this day remains the tallest structure in Germany. The view from the top stretching across Berlin and all the way to Brandenburg is a major sightseeing highlight. Nearby is Gendarmenmarkt widely lauded as Berlins most beautiful square. The German Cathedral the French Cathedral and the Concert Hall form an ensemble of great majesty and grandeur here. The atmosphere of the Hackesche Höfe also within the central Mitte district is somewhat less grand but all the more laid-back easygoing and relaxed for it. This retail complex is the largest series of enclosed courtyards in Germany and has been heritage-listed since 1977. For an authentic taste of Old Berlin explore the courtyards vibrant mix of art galleries cinemas theatres variety venues restaurants and bars not to mention all the welcoming little shops and big-name flagship stores. Theres also no escaping the citys artistic flair here. A characteristic that nearly a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall remains a defining feature perhaps more so than in any other capital. Berlin is the creative workshop of Germany a trendsetter and a capital of fashion design and music. The progressive spirit of optimism that engulfed the reunified city was – and still is – astounding. Hundreds of backyard art studios emerged from the shadows and art soon began to take over streets the walls of buildings and even entire districts. Famously artists have also appropriated the remains of the Berlin Wall the section from Oberbaum bridge to Ostbahnhof station now going by the name of East Side Gallery has become an illustrated encyclopaedia of street art. Today Kreuzberg Prenzlauer Berg Neukölln and Wedding are the districts of choice for more than 20000 artists. It is this creative force that lies behind the citys distinctive vibe – a vibe that renders Berlin the capital for alternative and established art alike. Immerse yourself in this creative cosmos. Let yourself be inspired seduced and enchanted. Get to know the people of Berlin. Besides all the sightseeing the locals are arguably the best reason to discover this incredible city – and the perfect excuse to come back and visit. read more » « less Highlights A passageway to history Brandenburg Gate » The elegance of power the government quarter in Berlin » Mixing with the stars the Berlinale film festival » A treasure trove of human history Berlins Museum Island » Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum » The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe » A taste of Old Berlin the Hackesche Höfe » All the way up Berlins TV tower » The show must go on Friedrichstadt-Palast » Quiet contemplation in the pleasure garden Berlin Cathedral » A memorial to peace the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church » For those with expensive tastes Quartier 206 » Two thousand years of German-Jewish history » German Historical Museum » Down the ages the Jewish Cemetery at Weissensee » A water sports paradise in the leafy suburbs Lake Wannsee » Berlin Wall » Berlin Philharmonic » Jewish Museum » Unter den Linden » German Historical Museum » Museum of Natural History Berlin » Germany Museum of Technology » Berlin Wall Memorial » Topography of Terror » DDR Museum » The Berlin- Hohenschönhausen Memorial » Related topics Museums Creative Shopping Top 100 Discover more in the local region Berlin Zoo – animal fun for all the family » Palaces and parks of Potsdam and Berlin » Glienicke Palace & Park – a touch of the mediterranean on the Havel river. » Mildenberg brickworks centre and industrial culture park » Highlights close A passageway to history Brandenburg Gate No other monument in Berlin is as famous around the world as Brandenburg Gate built between 1789 and 1791 to plans by C. G. Langhans on Pariser Platz in the heart of the city. After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 Brandenburg Gate became impassable for 28 years. As a signature attraction and symbol of German reunification it now represents the past and present of the German capital in exemplary fashion. The gate is supported by six Doric columns forming five passageways with pedestrian-only access. The famous quadriga depicting the goddess of victory Victoria riding a four-horse chariot was added in 1794. The elegance of power the government quarter in Berlin The route along Wilhelmstrasse right through the old and new government quarter and embassy district heads towards Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. The ministerial buildings and the Federal Chancellery in particular reflect the successful synthesis of the old with the new through prestigious yet modest elegance. From here your gaze is immediately drawn to the Reichstag one of the most famous sights in Berlin. Its glass dome by leading British architect Norman Foster has become a hugely popular attraction for visitors from far and wide. Mixing with the stars the Berlinale film festival The citys largest cultural event and a major festival for the international film industry the Berlinale is for Germany what the Oscars are for Hollywood.

At a height of more than 200 metres its observation platforms offer a magnificent panoramic view of the city. The tower was opened in 1969 although apparently the architects were not invited to the ceremony. The reason was that those in power at the time were annoyed about the cross-shaped reflection on the outer panels – known as the Popes revenge.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria From mining to skiing - Austria From mining to skiing - Austria A small mining town in Austrian land of Styria has transformed into a very popular ski resort. Schladming is famous for many events in winter skiing sports and excellent ski slopes. Its recognised far off and attracts visitors from all over the globe. Its just a 3 hours drive from Slovenia and its a world renowned ski centre. The central ski slopes are located on a mountain Planai but around it there are also many other high class skiing centres. Once mining today skiing The town of Schladming was first mentioned in 1180 but with a different name resembling Slaebnich. At the time the entire Styria was part of the Slavic dukedom of Karantanija. During German colonization the town started getting a Germanic character. As there was a lot of ore to be found here the settlement attracted many miners. At the heights of mining industry there was around 1500 miners living here which was a noticeable number at the time. It was around that time that we know of first initiatives for combining the rights and working conditions for all miners started. During reformation the miners joined the rebellious peasants which lead to the almost complete destruction of the town by the grand duke Ferdinand I. Still the rich deposits of silver lead copper and other ores made sure the town was quickly rebuilt. Another great transformation took place in 1865 when the town got the railroad track. It was around that period that the town started attracting tourists which boosted the service sector and expanded year after year. Today they are famous for winter sports. Winter sports dominates The town has transformed from a small mining community into a ski centre of superlatives.

The central ski slopes are located on a mountain Planai but around it there are also many other high class but not as famous skiing centres. A cable cart can take you from the town to the Mt. Planai from where there are great connections to other parts of the mountain range as well.

Mainz is famous for its university its Roman heritage its status as a media hub and regional capital and its three most defining features the Romanesque cathedral the Gutenberg printing press and the Rhineland carnival. The people of Mainz have good reason to be proud of their citys history spanning almost 2000 years. This rich cultural heritage incorporates a well-established winegrowing tradition which only adds to Mainzs appeal. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner For over 1000 years the citys skyline has been dominated by one building Mainz Cathedral. Towering majestically in its central location the cathedral is one of the most important churches in Germany. Its foundation stone was laid in 975 AD under the aegis of Bishop Willigis. In its shadows lie the medieval and early modern quarters of Mainz. The hustle and bustle centres around the twisting narrow lanes with names such as Nasengässchen and Heringsbrunnengasse as well as the many small shops boutiques and cafés surrounding pretty Kirschgarten square with its romantic timber-framed houses and Marienbrunnen fountain. In the evenings one thing is plain to see Mainz is Germanys wine capital. Rheinhessen is the countrys largest winegrowing region and a generation of young vintners are proving that they have what it takes to achieve extraordinary feats year after year. Locals enjoy the fruits of the winegrowers labours in cosy bars and taverns with pious names like Collection Box and Confessional. The Weinmarkt is one of Mainzs three major festivals. It made its first post-war appearance in 1946 with the French occupying forces contributing a remarkable 100000 litres of wine as a conciliatory and friendly gesture. The citys other major festivals are carnival were on the Rhine after all and Midsummers Eve a huge four-day fair that takes place at the end of June. Originally held in memory of Johannes Gutenberg the fair today comprises a vibrant mix of music traditional customs variety entertainment delicious food and of course wine. In contrast to the lively old quarter the view of Mainz from the banks of the Rhine is rather distinguished quiet and almost somewhat austere. The city is dominated by two architectural periods the modern age as evidenced by the town hall the Hilton hotel and Rheingoldhalle complex and the Renaissance-Baroque with the Neues Zeughaus the Deutschordenshaus and the Electoral Palace. According to some art historians the unusually ornate nuanced design of the Electoral Palaces facade surpasses even that of Heidelberg Castle – though locals in Heidelberg might think differently! Mainz also offers a wealth of fascinating museums. The Gutenberg Printing Museum and the Central Romano-Germanic Museum in the Electoral Palace stand out as the best in the city. The palaces pre-history and early history collections along with those on Roman and early medieval history are complemented by large restoration workshops that enjoy an international reputation – even Ötzi the Iceman found in the Alps has paid a visit. An even broader spectrum from the Stone Age to modern times is explored at Mainz State Museum founded in 1803 with 36 paintings donated by Napoleon. The Cathedral and Diocesan Museum in the cathedral provides information about the history of the episcopal church and the bishopric. The Museum of Municipal History gives an extensive insight into the development of Mainz while the Natural History Museum is the largest of its kind in Rhineland-Palatinate. The Kunsthalle Mainz art gallery rounds off the museum highlights in impressive fashion the strikingly redesigned building at the former customs port is now encased in glass and even features a sloped exhibition floor on a seven degree incline. Of course if you want to see the world from another perspective you could just enjoy a glass or two or more of the fantastic local wines served in the citys bars and restaurants. But thats not a bad thing remember.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria The valley of falling water – Maltatal The valley of falling water – Maltatal Maltatal is a valley where youll for some 14 kilometres stretch of road see more waterfalls rapids and even a huge dam than you can imagine. The interesting mountain panoramic road to the famous lake is very attractive for bikers cyclists and hikers… as well as many other athletes who use it as the base to go on in the mountains. The famous road start at the elevation of 911 meters and ends at 1933 meters with many tunnels of which some more resemble mines. The panoramic road ends at the parking road of the hotel near the lake. The best view of the clear water is from the lookout point the »Skywalk« suspended 200 meters above ground hooked to the dam. Falling waters The valley of Malta has many waterfalls and in the winter they become attractive for ice climbing. During summer people prefer watching them or climb the established feratas along the falling water. This is a great way to cool off in hot summer days. Climbing is very attractive and you get a special set of guides for it. Ice climbing is especially exciting so you get many people coming here. In the summer it’s a special feeling climbing an almost slick rock near the waterfall. The beautiful valley is partly ended by a dam. Partly because that’s where the road ends but it’s where the beautiful mountain paths begin that take you along the many lakes and creeks. During winter there’s also tours skiing available apart from ice climbing. Skiing down with a view of the lake is a special experience especially if you take on the highest peak of Hochalmspitze 3360 m. The Kölnbrein dam This is the largest dam in Austriy and among the largest in Europe. It’s 200 meters tall 626 meters long and 41 meters wide. Behind it is the lake with the same name. The lake is captured by the grand stage of High Tur glaciers and contains 15 million cubic meters of water proving to be among the biggest engineering achievements of central Europe. The mighty complex produces around 618400 MWh of electricity annually and was created in 1979. It also holds precious water reserves for the dry summer months. Due to high efficiency and accessibility it can produce enough electricity to cover Austria’s needs and beyond. It’s the main reason that the tourism in the valley has developed to such an extend. Next to the dam there’s a hotel with a restaurant in the form of a falling cylinder. This is the base for many paths in the mountains. Due to height German rowing team trains there annually mostly when preparing for world competitions and Olympic games. And the dam even features bungee jumping. The valley gets more and more visits and the offers are ever richer. Home inns and typical taverns mountain cabins and basically everything to make a visitor welcome. All you hostel lovers there’s also a near by tourist hostel at Bad Gasteinu. The steep road with many unlighted tunnels with some equipped with traffic lights and too many waterfalls follows the river Malta down below. And from almost all over the place you can see many restaurants and the huge dam with the background of might Alps. All of it just invites you to visit the valley.

Blessed with a unique natural setting the island also enjoys a mild maritime climate. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Although Heligoland is not strictly located on the high seas from a geographical or legal point of view it is often referred to as Germanys only high seas island due to its significant distance from the mainland. The island has good connections though with boats travelling to it from Büsum Hamburg Cuxhaven Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven. A particularly enjoyable way of making the North Sea crossing to Heligoland is to take a small cruise ship and see the majestic red cliffs rise up out of the water as you approach your destination. Heligoland has an interesting geological structure and is in fact an archipelago. The main island has three distinct areas the lower middle and upper lands although the best spot for sunbathing is on the smaller island known as the Dune. As there are no cars and thus no exhaust fumes on the island Heligoland is an ideal destination for health and wellness holidays and for allergy sufferers who will benefit from its fresh virtually pollen-free North Sea air and mild maritime climate. Various themed trails guide holidaymakers through the islands flora and fauna to the worlds smallest nature conservation area – the Lummenfelsen guillemot cliffs. The charming Heligoland Museum showcases the islands history and culture. It is located in the Nordseehalle a multi-purpose conference and events centre for business travellers. Those seeking a real flavour of the island should make a trip to the heritage-listed fishermens houses in the harbour where they will get the chance to try a freshly caught local delicacy – the world-famous Heligoland lobster. read more » « less Discover more in the local region Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park – endless expanses and endless beauty » Spiekeroog – a lush North Sea dream » Museen am Meer » UNESCO-Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea and Hallig Islands Biosphere Reserve » www.helgoland.com Copyrights Home Leisure and recreation Germanys islands North Sea islands Heligoland top of page Search at germany.travel Save route Share/forward route Print route Delete route Create new route My routes 0 View in Google route planner Unnamed route 0 DestinationsLength of route 0 kmDuration 0 Means of transport The route cannot be calculated.

Along with the Roland statue the citys very own statue of liberty it still stands as a reminder of the pride that the locals have for their city their freedom and their sovereignty. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Once inside the town hall you simply must take a look in the Upper Hall. In this exquisite room the lovingly crafted model ships dating from the 16th to the 18th century reflect the importance of shipping for the city. Other special attractions include the adjoining Golden Chamber with its art nouveau features. A gem of a different kind can be found below ground the historical Ratskeller – Germanys oldest wine cellar. Writers such as Wilhelm Hauff and Heinrich Heine used to come here for inspiration and todays visitors can still sample from the largest collection of German wines in the country. Back on the market square you can stand eye to eye with Sir Roland – or rather eye to knee. Because at five and a half metres in height 10.21 metres including the base and baldachin this is the tallest free-standing sculpture of the German Middle Ages. It represents Hanseatic freedom and also served a much more practical purpose as the distance between the knees is exactly one Bremen elle a historical unit of measurement it is thought that the pragmatic Bremen merchants used it to measure out their material. Today it is customary to touch Rolands pointed knees before setting off on a stroll through the lanes of Bremen old town.

Lifestyle joie de vivre or lebensart – whatever you call it Munich has it in spades. It might be down to the clear blue skies or simply the citys beauty but one things for certain the people of Munich always like to show their best side whether theyre in a beer garden on one of the exclusive shopping streets or in Bayern Munichs stadium. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner A modern cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage as suave as it is easygoing buzzing and yet tranquil. Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital. You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich but it doesnt hurt. Besides these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions. Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. That said undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square – it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls. The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the Hofbräuhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around. Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses. Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market – from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies. But take note bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle – so dont be tempted to try least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse Maximilianstrasse Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal. Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques. For a far more affordable not to mention more relaxed shopping experience head to Munichs pub and club quarter which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district but also extends around Glockenbachviertel Gärtnerplatz square and Müllerstrasse.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Koralps - Austria Koralps - Austria So close yet almost unknown The skiing region of Koralps is the only place in south eastern Alps that has the elevation of over 2000m. Koralps are a beloved skiing resort both for downhill skiers and boarders as for cross country and tour skiers. Many people visit them in the summer as well for the unspoiled nature where they either cycle of hike. One of the main reasons for a visit is the great view from the top which covers a huge part of Austria with many Slovenian mountains as well. The tourist infrastructure is well developed with restaurants guesthouses and lodgings of different categories. Visitors in Klagenfurt Celovec can enjoy the Alps as a day trip. They can stay at the hostel Klagenfurt in the regional centre and biggest town. The Koralps are in Southern Austria and divide two regions. They are mostly made of metamorphic rocks some of which are of great interest to geological research. There are also some places where they dig for half-precious stones. In the past they used to dig for raw materials to produce glass and porcelain as well as there is a lot of flint stone and clay o hand. Most of the waters are collected behind a dam which is used to produce hydroelectricity. An alpine and tour skier’s paradise You’ll find here around 28 kilometres of ski slopes from which 13km range in the mid difficult and 12km in the easy category. There are also 60 kilometres of cross country tracks and a sledding range. This means every visitor can something to do. There is almost no waiting in lines as there are many cable carts with the joint capacity of 10.000 an hour. Many tour skiers also come as the top is the best place to start a wild descend in any direction. Generally it is not wanted for them to mix with other skiers as they represent an obstacle on the arranged slopes if they walk up them. But as the alpine range is big enough there’s enough place for everybody to enjoy their winter activities. Unspoiled nature is their great advantage The tourist operators who work in this alpine region are proud and like to point out they have the unspoiled nature. They also make sure they keep good care of it and make sure it’s sustainable. True there is an asphalt road leading all the way to the top but you can only reach it by bicycle or on foot. The road is there only for the radar stations which is at the very top. And it’s these huge round radar dishes that are one of the reasons why people come to visit the Koralps. They are visible from a long way away from many valleys and other peaks. The trails are very well marked and a lucky hiker will be able to see and maybe invent take a photo of a mountain goat or a groundhog on the way to the top as they live there in abundance. The most popular peak for the hikers is undoubtable the tallest one of them all. It’s the so called Speikkogel with 2140 elevation above the sea level. The steep slopes are during spring and summer months covered with soft grass and those planes are the home to many mountain flowers. On the way you will often be able to stop at a mountain cabin where they offer food and drink but also bed for the night. They also have other offers which feature a range of activities from Nordic walk courses skiing boarding wellness and many more. Koralps are really close to Slovenia but for most of us quite unknown. Since they are very well developed for tourists with nice skiing slopes and great view from the top but also with much more to offer than just that they are a great destination to try and visit.

Are the people of Freiburg so cheerful because their city gets more sun than anywhere else in Germany or have they been rewarded with so much sunshine precisely because they are so good-natured? Its hard to say. But what is certain is that life is good in Germanys southernmost city. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Freiburg has more to offer than friendly faces alone including one of Germanys prettiest old quarters with its characteristic bächle – the narrow channels of water that run alongside the pavements. Add to that a wealth of culture and history lots of cafés and cosy bars delicious regional food and scenic surroundings. Whats more the overall atmosphere is easygoing laid-back and more carefree than most. Its almost – in a word – mediterranean. Experience it for yourself with a stroll through the old quarter overlooked by the 116-metre-tall spire of the stunning minster one of Germanys most beautiful religious buildings. The square on which it stands is the largest in the city centre and hosts a market every day except Sunday. The squares main sights are the Historical Merchants Hall from 1532 with its deep-red facade and colourful corner towers the Museum of Municipal History in the Haus Zum Schönen Eck from 1761 and the Alte Wache now the House of Badensian Wines – certainly not the worst use for this beautiful old guardhouse! The other major square in the old quarter is Augustinerplatz. Overlooked by an Augustinian abbey and the remains of the city wall this is a popular rendezvous for locals which probably has something to do with the stone steps that flank one side. The lively atmosphere here is strongly reminiscent of the Spanish Steps in Rome. Its then onto Rathausplatz location of the Old and New Town Hall gothic St. Martins Church and a fountain with a statue of monk and alchemist Berthold Schwarz who supposedly invented gunpowder here in the city. Oberlinden and Unterlinden are two rather more peaceful squares in the centre of Freiburg and both have a beautiful old lime tree as their focal point. True Freiburg connoisseurs describe pretty little Adelhauser-Platz which lies away from the beaten track as the citys loveliest square. These marvellous locations provide an ideal backdrop for the dozens of celebrations both large and small which take place every year in Freiburgs old town. The programme kicks off in January with the international trade fair of culture and the grenzenlos festival and continues uninterrupted through to December when the Christmas market and the Circus Festival round off the season. Among the highlights in between are the colourful antics of the Freiburg Carnival the citys marathon film seasons open-air cinemas a summer film festival various fun fairs the Summer of Culture the Sea You music festival and the Tent-Music-Festival as well as plays performed in the town hall courtyard the Lake Night Festival and a wine festival. Its hard to believe there could be so much going on but just ask anyone whos been! And if all the celebrations get a bit too much you can unwind in the many parks and green spaces such as Schlossberg hill Mundenhof wildlife park 1284m Mount Schauinsland on the doorstep of Freiburg and lots of lakes in and around the city. After all Freiburg values Mother Nature and never wavers in its commitment to its environmental policies of sustainability and renewable energy. This has been a great success. As a green city Freiburg has become a global benchmark for eco-friendly living. But you dont have to be an energy expert to be impressed by Freiburg – even if you visit on one of those rare occasions when the sun has decided to take a day off. read more » « less Highlights Typically Freiburg the Bächle » Gothic grandeur Freiburg Minster » Architectural monuments and zest for life the old quarter » A worthy setting for beautiful art the Augustinian Museum » Museum of Modern Art » Wentzingerhaus Museum of City History » Colombischlössle Archaeological Museum » Museum of Natural History and Ethnological Collection » Related topics Museums Wine country Historic Highlights of Germany Discover more in the local region Typically Freiburg the Bächle » Gothic grandeur Freiburg Minster » Wentzingerhaus Museum of City History » Museum of Modern Art » Highlights close Typically Freiburg the Bächle Freiburgs Bächle are one of the distinctive features of the historical old quarter.

Lifestyle joie de vivre or lebensart – whatever you call it Munich has it in spades. It might be down to the clear blue skies or simply the citys beauty but one things for certain the people of Munich always like to show their best side whether theyre in a beer garden on one of the exclusive shopping streets or in Bayern Munichs stadium. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner A modern cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage as suave as it is easygoing buzzing and yet tranquil. Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital. You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich but it doesnt hurt. Besides these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions. Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. That said undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square – it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls. The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the Hofbräuhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around. Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses. Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market – from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies. But take note bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle – so dont be tempted to try least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse Maximilianstrasse Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal. Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques. For a far more affordable not to mention more relaxed shopping experience head to Munichs pub and club quarter which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district but also extends around Glockenbachviertel Gärtnerplatz square and Müllerstrasse. The area is as renowned for its party atmosphere as it is for its alternative shops its relaxed atmosphere and its vibrant LGBT scene. A trip to the English Garden doesnt cost you a penny and Munichs very own piece of paradise situated between the Isar and the city centre is the ultimate chill-out zone. From lazing around or watching people master the latest craze of slacklining better still have a go yourself to the insane fun of surfing the Eisbach river anything goes in the park. Add to that two of Munichs most beautiful beer gardens one at the Chinese Pagoda the other at a picturesque lakeside spot and youve got the perfect recipe for a relaxing afternoon. These are the beer gardens where youll find an eclectic crowd who live life to the full in the shade of ancient chestnut trees. Thats the Munich way. The beer gardens came to be called cellars or keller – as in Salvatorkeller Löwenbräukeller and Hofbräukeller – because brewers once kept their beer underground to keep it cool and soon hit upon the idea of selling it from the very same spot. This was the start of a sacred tradition that as luck would have it is alive and well among locals today. The people of Munich are also proud of the citys museums many of which are of international standing such as the Deutsches Museum the worlds biggest science and technology museum the Alte Pinakothek the Neue Pinakothek the Pinakothek der Moderne and the Lenbachhaus Museum. Then theres the Glyptothek Museum the State Collections of Antiques and the Brandhorst Museum with its breathtaking collection of modern art from 1945 onwards. Here in Munichs Art Quarter however youll also find charming little bars cosy cafés and pretty boutiques yet another example of how the Munich lifestyle combines culture with the finer things in life. The BMW Museum has the citys automotive heritage covered while the stars of Bayern Munich show teams visiting the Allianz Arena another side to the citys unique lifestyle what its like to always be on top. Even if youre not a Bayern Munich fan its still well worth trying to get a ticket to see them play. The stadium atmosphere alone is world-class and guaranteed to give you goosebumps. And you wont be surprised to discover that the Allianz Arena is one of the worlds most spectacular stadiums. It is after all in Munich. read more » « less Highlights Bavaria Filmstadt  the kingdom of illusions » Allianz Arena Home advantage » Munich Pinakotheken galleries a world of art in Maxvorstadt » English Garden Munich a haven of relaxation in the big city » Marienplatz  Munichs magnificent main square » The Hofbräuhaus beer hall the measure of Munich » The ancestral home of the Bavarian rulers the Wittelsbach residence » Pure driving pleasure BMW Welt » Fatherly pride Nymphenburg Palace » A beer festival for the world Oktoberfest » A gourmets paradise the Viktualienmarkt food market » 24-hour party people Glockenbachviertel and Gärtnerplatz » Identity and culture the Jewish Museum » Century-defining works the Brandhorst Museum » The Olympic Park » German Museum » Lenbachhaus » Alte Pinakothek » Neue Pinakothek » Haus der Kunst » Munich Residenz » Munich Frauenkirche — The Cathedral of Our Dear Lady » Related topics Museums Traditions and customs Shopping Discover more in the local region Märchenwald fairytale forest – once upon a time in the Isar valley … » Nymphenburg Palace & Park.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Bad Kleinkirchheim - Austria Bad Kleinkirchheim - Austria One of more beloved ski resorts in Austria among Slovenians is the resort Bad Kleinkirchhem. Naturally they dont only offer skiing they offer much more than that! Every winter we go for a winter trip a snow break and this time we’ve decided on a closer location – for a change. Usually the far off places seemed more interesting but I’ve asked myself wasn’t the only reason to choose them just the distance? There are several extremely good skiing destinations much closer to home as well. Skiing or spoiling oneself in the spa? It’s a great feeling to come from the white slopes into the thermal spa. An ideal offer both for winter sport enthusiasts and those who just want to laze off in the hot water. Bad Kleinkirchheim offers a varied palette of thermal pools in two spas – the old one and the new one. There is a quality and price difference between the two. Despite a slightly higher price it is worth to visit the modern spa which even features three floors of saunas. And the surrounding mountains offer many skiing sledding and tour skiing opportunities along with other snow fun… including – if the weather conditions allow – ice climbing. Naturally cross country skiing has a special set of great tracks as well. The guest is always first Austrians have an extremely well developed tourist sector and among most popular destinations is the Austrian Carinthia. So Bad Kleinkirchheim fits right in with tourist attractions especially since the beginning of its tourism date back to the Roman Empire. The definite advantage is that there are geothermal springs and beautiful nature all around. And the tourist offer is made even richer by various sporting events and competitions. With their whole family offer they really can take care of everybody. Apart from wither sport tourism they also have a great offer of heritage historical and natural a great culinary offer and naturally many interesting events and organized activities as it is expected of a high class tourist destination. There are many tourist guides to make sure you’ll get a great experience while staying there. The offer however is not only limited to winter months as the surrounding nature welcomes visitors during all four seasons. And despite it being so close it was my first visit to a place just a two hour’s bus drive from the Styrian capital to the famous tourist destination. So from the slopes to the spas you can also stop by at authentic farm houses among which many are dedicated to tourism as well. The prices are a bit higher than back home but the quality of offer is well worth the price. And if you prefer backpacking and a hosteling experience I’d suggest you book the Hostel Villach in Villach just a short distance from Bad Kleinkirchheim.

Together with Wilhelmshöhe Palace it forms a unique whole that combines culture nature and landscape architecture in perfect harmony. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Kassels Wilhelmshöhe Park is a baroque creation in which developments in the art technology and landscape design movements of the time can be discerned. The 300-year-old topography exemplifies the coming of age of landscape architecture in absolutist Europe. It dates from 1696 when Landgrave Karl of Hesse-Kassel aimed to elevate the Kassel princes over the other ruling houses of the day. In 1701 Italian master builder Giovanni Francesco Guerniero added large parts of the water features which in 1717 were crowned with a statue of Hercules that dominates all it surveys. This mighty copper figure is designed to symbolise the virtues of a wise and just ruler and the omnipotence of the Landgrave himself. At the foot of the 70-metre plinth a unique spectacle is played out. Over 750000 litres of water rush down a total of twelve kilometres of water features towards the Grand Fountain in the Palace Pond where the water jets 52 metres into the air under the force of natural pressure. Lit up in the evenings the cascades and fountains between the Hercules monument and Wilhelmshöhe Palace are a sight to behold. Significant art can also be found in the palace itself. Severely damaged in the Second World War the building was restored as a museum and opened to the public in 1974. With its old masters gallery antiquities collection and collection of prints and drawings it is one of the main attractions at Wilhelmshöhe Park. Opening times tours and tips Opening times Wilhelmshöhe visitor centre April to October Tuesday to Sunday and public holidays 10am to 5pm November to March Saturday Sunday and public holidays 10am to 4pm Hercules visitor centre 10am to 5pm daily Museum at Wilhelmshöhe Palace Tuesday to Sunday 10am to 5pm Wednesday 10am to 8pm Wilhelmshöhe Park and water features open all year round with water features operating from 1 May to 3 October on Sundays Wednesdays and public holidays from 2.30pm water features illuminated on the first Saturday of every month.

Germany’s most original town hall There are plenty of historical town halls in Germany but probably the most beautiful of them all is the one in Michelstadt in the romantically situated Odenwald low mountain range. You’d have to search far and wide to find one as fancy and unique as this. The world around 1500 you could say it has been preserved true to the original here. Incredibly romantic timber-framed buildings little crooked lanes pretty houses and the lively hustle and bustle around the market square. And in between tiny shops lovely cafés bakeries cider pubs restaurants and no less than three breweries. The town hall. Simply magical. In the centre is the historical town hall that looks like it’s straight out of a fairy tale film with its pointed gables and bay turrets. The Diebsturm Thief’s Tower by the town wall which doesn’t have a door or window on the ground floor just like in the Rapunzel fairy tale goes perfectly with this. If you take the Early Medieval Kellereihof Late Gothic town church ancient Einhards-Basilika and of course the legendary landscape of the Odenwald low mountain range too there’s just one thing for it go there yourself... and be enchanted.

Gateway to the world beautiful seafaring hub maritime capital of the north – even the normally reserved locals find it hard to conceal their pride in their home city its ambience and its cosmopolitan charm. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner How do you like the sound of a port sightseeing tour followed by a stroll through the old town before heading to HafenCity Hamburgs new city centre? Or perhaps the other way around… ? There are countless ways to discover the beguiling character of this Hanseatic trade centre that is at once steeped in tradition and at the forefront of modernity. That said no visit to Hamburg would be complete without a boat trip around one of Europes biggest ports. Sightseeing boats launch from the Landungsbrücken jetties and weave their way through huge container vessels majestic steam-powered ocean liners and elegant yachts an experience that can only be described as unforgettable. Make your visit all the more memorable with a leisurely stroll through the old town where noble merchants once traded coffee tea and spices. Today its an inviting scene of residences and grand corner buildings from the 17th to the 19th century quaint restaurants and laid-back bars. Another reminder of Hamburgs heritage is the historical Speicherstadt home to the worlds largest single complex of traditional brick warehouses resting on thousands of oak supports and intersected by narrow waterways the Fleets. Or if you want to discover the Hamburg of today and tomorrow head to HafenCity one of the largest inner-city construction projects in Europe and a contrast between seafaring heritage and cutting-edge architecture in the heart of the Überseequartier. Nestled between Speicherstadt and the port this maritime world of discovery and shopping paradise stretches all the way to the Hamburg Cruise Center along a broad boulevard. If this place doesnt give you a taste for cruises then nothing ever will. After seeing some of the worlds biggest and most spectacular cruise ships sailing in and out of Hamburgs port youre sure to leave with aspirations of sailing the seven seas. The people of Hamburg are especially fond of the Queen Mary 2 a vessel for whom the city has become something of a second home. Every time the majestic ocean liner comes into port thousands of well-wishers line the Elbe to welcome her – often accompanied by a huge fireworks display and always with great exuberance. There are many places to enjoy spectacular views of the citys maritime goings-on such as the viewpoint at the Cruise Center or from the Perlenkette along the banks of the Elbe with its luxurious residences and exclusive restaurants or from the Magellan Terraces that give an unparalleled view of Hamburgs latest landmark the Elbe Philharmonic Hall on the western tip of HafenCity. One of the best places to see Hamburg in all its glory is the public viewing platform at the futuristic Dockland office building which rises up from the Elbe at a height of 40 metres. Views of a very different kind are on offer in the lively slightly flipped-out alternative quarter of St. Pauli with its famous red light district the Reeperbahn. Or theres the fish market in Altona where fresh fish and much more besides is auctioned every Sunday at the crack of dawn – a shopping experience like no other. And speaking of shopping Hamburg has something for everyone including on the Jungfernstieg the citys chic centre of shopping and finance that begins at the Inner Alster. Even here in the heart of the city you can take a gentle stroll along the riverside promenades. The same is true of the Outer Alster the perfect place for a spot of leisure and recreation within easy reach of central Hamburg. And if you get the impression that the people of Hamburg simply cant get enough of the water then youd be absolutely right. read more » « less Highlights Hamburg Kunsthalle art masterpieces spanning 700 years » A beautiful harbour and thick ancient walls the warehouse district » Infamous around the world St. Pauli » Geometry brought to life Dockland » Hamburgs new city centre HafenCity » Long-running hits Hamburgs musicals » Music of the future the Elbe Philharmonic Hall » Hamburger Port » Hamburgs most famous landmark St. Michaels Church » A lake in the heart of the city the Alster » The place to see and be seen the Jungfernstieg » Out for a stroll in Planten un Blomen Park » Civic pride Hamburgs town hall » For the young and young at heart Miniaturwelt Wunderland model railway » Speicherstadt Museum » Bucerius Kunst Forum » Deichtorhallen » BallinStadt Emigration Museum Hamburg » Related topics Musicals & shows Shopping UNESCO World Heritage Discover more in the local region Speicherstadt and Kontorhaus district with Chilehaus » Hamburg Dungeon horrible histories in the Hanseatic city » Planten un Blomen Park Hamburg.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Me alter-ego Vienna and Sex in the city Me alter-ego Vienna and Sex in the city My soul led me down the trail of music and songs. I went to listen I went to watch… I went and my other me went… I wanted to taste the tune of rock’n’roll. I received much more. Experiencing Vienna in my very own way You melt into the fabric of the magical city as soon as you align yourself to the flow of the subway train. Smell of tracks smell of people… everybody speaking their own language and with some imagination you see what they say what they think and what they feel. You take on the form of their essence for now you heart beats with this city. Suitcase small but comfortable Jeans black nail polish some jewellery and a lot of enthusiasm. You make a fist raise it high and enjoy the sounds of string. I know today to be my day! The scent of a guitar carries me into a hall full of people. We all wait for one - Alter Bridge! No disappointment. City laughs. We all laugh. I think we all blushed a little. The string’s a lifeline connected directly to our hearts. Full of adrenalin I return to the hostel. Tired from the travel from tension from the concert… but me and my alter-ego are too full of adrenalin! No bedtime yet! I flew on the wings arriving to the room. I can’t believe the body to be so tired when the soul is so awake. Let’s hit the hay. Tomorrow is another day. The roomie is not happy about my night wondering through the room. Angry looks and a comment of utter dissatisfaction with my behaviour just bounced off this happy face of mine above any negativity. Today I’m happy. I thought how silly of a person to take a dormitory room without expecting a happy-go-lucky person like me prancing into the room at night lighting a light and letting out a sound. Majestic Vienna in the morning Everybody is rushing to work. The city is overcrowded with people. I missed a heartbeat of connection with the city but got in synch with when I saw the first café with a couple holding hands glazing at each other full of love. A punker with red hair slowly approaches with his face full of piercings and an elegant lady with a fancy handbag and a strong perfume rushes by me on a micro scooter. A micro scooter! People here love micro scooters and MP3 players. Vienna charmed me anew It’s not my first time in Vienna. Hence no interest in the buildings no interest in sights. I’m interested in people. I watch sip and learn. I fill my soul with a few hour long walk through the art gallery where I realize how thin a line between being humane and being human is. Everyone who sees the Egon Schiele exhibition and the other I might say of same conviction will reflect on themselves at least a bit for walking among these works of art you see how little it takes to fully reveal one’s self – and how much talent egoism and difference it takes to show this to the world. Recommended. Night life – yes or no? Yes. Following the advice of the teens from the subway club Chelsea is the place to go. Nothing special I’d say. Maybe. But its modesty and good music convinced me. It’s clear this club had been through many a thing. Cracks carry a burden on their shoulders. Not just the fact it’s under the railroad… we can’t imagine how many stories unfolded here. Stories are written here with words that need to remain hidden and untouched. Austrians are shy people. It’s clear as soon as I show I’m different. I’m foreign. They eat me with their eyes and I feel they desire a pinch of my devilishness my spontaneity. Dorm room shines in its true colours First the angry roomie” takes my shower gel privileges away come on it’s like taking somebody’s used socks then during the night I see something that surprises even an open minded person. A girl from the dorm decided to bring her nightly treat into the room to give us a glimpse of Sex in the city – or a little nightly digital TV programme – free of charge. And by a treat I’m not talking about a dildo but a piece of flesh. Drunk to oblivion they were unable to reach a climax in 2-4 hours time is a very relative and touchy thing in the still of the night but they have tried really hard. Moaning his nor hers didn’t help. I awake to the sounds of ecstasy. It doesn’t end. We go for the toilet if there’s nothing to do at night you need to go pee toss and turn in beds and don’t know what to do – but they don’t seem to notice. Drunk as a skunk When they during a pause relieve themselves of a pint or two of consumed alcohol I realize how drunk the girl really is. Leaving the toilet she found herself in front of the wardrobe closet and due to her dumbed down reflexes she could not avoid them. The wardrobe hit her so hard he woke up the people in the other room too. Oh yeah when there’s war it’s war for everybody no sleeping tonight! Open invitation Next morning a Spaniard a really cool roommate told me I had a feeling it was an open invitation to join in!” I only laughed when he crossed himself in the which made me sure I was not the only one who thought how tasteless and idiotic this behaviour was. Not understanding the angry and convicting looks from tired faces a friend of hers told the girl she was a bit too loud – but she remembered nothing. Sad isn’t it? Alter ego It’s ok for people to escape from their daily routine and let go forget and enjoy the ride where it takes us. Each in their own way. Through smells sights sounds or sex… it’s just important not to forget our soul for regardless of the city Vienna or any else the adventures stories or experiences we get – tomorrow is a new day when we’ll have to live with today. Travel meet live! Your alter ego should just be the last resort to open your eyes and give you courage to do one or two things more which you might not do otherwise … Good night Vienna!

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Salzburg Salzburg Salzburg without „The Sound of Music I should admit it I hate the movie „The sound of music which everybody seems to love. Even a friend of mine told me once that I was a bad person just because of that. So it was such a challenge for me to visit Salzburg avoiding all „The Sound of Music related attractions. And I did it! @Credit Hohenwerfen Österreich My first stop was a double attraction located in Werfen about one hour from Salzburg by train. The ride is quite good the train departs in the Salzburg main train station every 30 minutes and it costs about 9 Euro one way. In Werfen I have visited two really amazing places The biggest ice cave in Europe called Eisriesenwelt and the Hohenwerfen castle. The Eisriesenwelt cave is open just during the summer time and one should carry a warm jacket and proper pair of shoes because the temperature inside is 0 degrees even if outside there is 30 or even more. At the Werfen train station a shuttle bus to the Eisriesenwelt departs every hour. The visit into the cave lasts about one hour but one should plan about 3 hours for the whole trip because after the 20-minute ride with a shuttle bus one should walk about 20 minutes take a cable car and walk another 20 minutes to get to the entrance of the cave. The entry costs 24 Euros and together with the cable car and the shuttle ride this whole trip costs about 35 to 40 Euro. But what it is to be seen there is totally worthy. Visitors are separated in groups given old oil lamps and guided into the cave a true masterpiece of nature. The guide tells us about the first men who discovered the cave back in the time where just the trip to get there lasted 2 days without shuttle buses and cable cars. The ice formations ice lagoons and ice stalagmites and stalactites that one can see around are really breathtaking. @Credit Eisriesenwelt Österreich Once I was back at the Werfen train station I decided to walk to the Hohenwerfen castle. It was a 15 minute nice walk to the parking place which is visible from the train station and easy to reach. There one can get up in a lift which costs 15 Euros including entrance to the castle. Without lift one should walk all the way up – I already had too much of that in the Eisriesenwelt. I was surprised to discover that this castle was used as a location in the TV show I was watching at that very same time The man in the high castle highly recommended dystopian series where Japan and Germany won the II World War and divided United States to dominate it. The place is beautiful well maintained with a nice and reasonably priced restaurant and during summer time there is a falcon show in the very pretty courtyard. This castle was famous in the Middle Ages for the falcons they domesticated for hunting following the Mongolian tradition which reached Europe in the XI Century. Now there is a non-profit society of romantics who still domesticate and train these birds at the castle providing the visitors with a wonderful show. The show lasts about half an hour and several falcons and other birds are shown to the public in fly hunting and performing skill tests. It was really something wonderful to see and free of charge. All together my visit to Werfen including the Eisriesenwelt and the Hohenwerfen castle took me the whole day. My third non-sound-of-music place to visit in Salzburg was the Augustiner Bräu a monastery built in 1621 which was turned into a brewery-restaurant because of the lack of monks. Here guests can buy beer directly from a fountain. A dream come true! Try appetizers and regional products and eat and drink at one of the five high-roof halls with capacity for about 1.400 guests back then used by monks for their daily meals. The entrance is free and one can just not buy anything and walk around admiring the halls and the amazing stained glass windows. Or like me have a really good beer and some bread goat cheese and grilled chicken from one of the different kiosks from local producers which offer excellent quality and reasonable prices. Because the place is a bit far away from Salzburg downtown one need to walk about 15 minutes along the river Salzach enjoying a wonderful view of this beautiful city which is way more beautiful than „The Sound of Music.

Fan of modern architecture? With Canary Wharf - one of London’s most instantly recognisable skyscrapers - standing proudly on the other side of the bridge it’s not all about the past. Formerly the tallest building in the United Kingdom this skyscraper marked the start of the area’s regeneration in the early 1990s and is now a buzzing mecca for international business and investment not to mention high-end shopping bars and restaurants 1 Tower Bridge 2. Spitalfields Located in bustling east London one of the city’s thriving arts and culture destinations Spitalfields is a hub of independent boutiques artisanal stores and pubs steeped in history. The heart of the city’s silk-weaving industry in the 17th and 18th centuries a ride around the area’s hidden alleyways is like cycling back in time with cobbled delights such as Princelet Street revealing original townhouses dating back to Georgian times. Nestled at the heart of this celebrated area lies Spitalfields Market. Originally founded in 1638 and re-stablished by King Charles II in 1682 this former food market is now home to original fashion jewellery and arts and crafts and lined with delectable eateries fit for every taste and budget. 2 Spitalfields 3. The Gherkin Officially called St Mary’s Axe but affectionately known as ‘the Gherkin’ by Londoners this cornichon-shaped building is a glass and steel wonder in the heart of the city. Completed in 2004 its distinctive structure has seen it star in a number of films including Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince while its location close to attractions including the Sky Garden Spitalfields and Brick Lane makes it a highlight on many a bike ride through the city. 3 The Gherkin 4. Lloyds Building A blueprint for Bowellism architecture the Lloyd’s Building’s external lifts and pipes make it another memorable landmark on the capital’s skyline. Built on the foundations of East India House the central office of the historic East India Company the building and its location have a staggering past while its ground-breaking ‘inside-out’ structure looks positively futuristic when illuminated at night. 4 Lloyds Building 5. Leadenhall Market From sci-fi to ancient history it’s just a short cycle from the Lloyd’s Building to Leadenhall Market. Dating back to the 1st century its location marks the centre of Roman London with the market flourishing until the Great Fire of London ravaged sections of it in 1666. Rising from the ashes once again it was reborn as a covered market swiftly becoming one of the city’s best known. Having undergone various facelifts throughout the centuries today its Victorian beauty makes it a perfect filming location – including in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone when it doubled as Diagon Alley. 5 Leadenhall Market 6. St Paul’s Cathedral At 111 metres high St Pauls Cathedral is one of the most recognisable landmarks on the London skyline its Baroque splendour elegantly holding its own against the soaring skyscrapers that dominate the City. Cycling in the cool shadow of its awe-inspiring dome it’s easy to imagine the 538-step climb to the top and the panoramic views that greet you on arrival. Designed in the 17th century by pre-eminent British architect Sir Christopher Wren today the cathedral is another favourite spot for movie makers as seen in the children’s classic Mary Poppins. 6 St Paul’s Cathedral 7. Bank of England Located on the corner of Threadneedle Street the Bank of England is the heart of Londons financial district. Designed by architect Sir Herbert Baker the 10 storey Neo-Classical building is crammed full of incredible works of art while its history as the eighth-oldest financial institution in the world makes it a fascinating sight for budding economists. Keen to see more? Just across the road lies the Royal Exchange an elegantly columned building known for its airy central courtyard intricate friezes and rich royal history. 7 Bank of England 8. London Bridge While not the most beautiful crossing London Bridge is one of the best-known in the city when it comes to popular culture even acting as the star of the show in the well-known British nursery rhyme London Bridge is falling down. One of 33 bridges over the Thames it’s the surrounding attractions that make London Bridge a must-see sight on any virtual tour. Surrounded by cultural hotspots including Borough Market – one of the city’s most historic food venues – the dizzy heights of The Shard and some of the area’s cosiest pubs it’s a fitting place to end our virtual bike ride of all the city has in store. 8 London Bridge Carleen Shoy 03 Jun 2020last updated Related articles Celebrate International Museum Week in Britain with these virtual tours Celebrate International Museum Week in Britain with these virtual tours 7 ways to enjoy a virtual British garden experience 7 ways to enjoy a virtual British garden experience Get a taste of Britain’s brilliant breweries dazzling distilleries and vibrant vineyards Get a taste of Britain’s brilliant breweries dazzling distilleries and vibrant vineyards British Entertainment Hub British Entertainment Hub Stay up to date Email Subscribe Find us on Facebook Twitter Instagram OUR WEBSITE Terms of use Sitemap Cookies Privacy Policy General Competition Terms and Conditions Accessibility statement User Generated Content Terms of Use Our other sites CorporateTradeBusiness EventsSelect languageMedia © 2020 VisitBritain.

Today with its Bauhaus-influenced design the mine is a triumph of modern industrial architecture and a centre for art and culture. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner It is often referred to as the worlds most iconic colliery. And rightly so as the architects Fritz Schupp and Martin Kremmer created a very special industrial complex here between 1927 and 1932. With a harmonious composition of red brick facades in a steel framework – a paragon of symmetry and geometry – the building still has great aesthetic appeal. In 2010 the Zollverein mine was the cultural and artistic centre of the European Capital of Culture Essen in North Rhine-Westphalia. Coal was mined and processed here for 135 years before the mine was decommissioned in 1986. Founded in 1998 the Zollverein Foundation very quickly dedicated its attention to repurposing the complex and preserving the industrial monument. With great success today it is a cultural highlight in the Ruhr region and a living museum of mining history and the development of industrial architecture. Visitors following the Zollverein heritage trail will learn about the modernists of the 1920s and 1930s the development of heavy industry and how black gold was processed preserved in all their glory here are the former separation plant the coal bunkers and the coal washery gargantuan machines and conveyor belts seemingly endless rows of coke ovens and six imposing chimneys. The tour also includes models films and installations. However it is not only the design of the colliery that stands out. The Red Dot Design Museum housed at the complex has the worlds largest collection of contemporary design and is now part of the World Heritage site.

Register here. Forgotten password? Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Lake break near Salzburg Lake break near Salzburg Ive decided to conclude my visit to Salzburg in a more tranquil surroundings. The nearby lakes are perfect for it just that especially during the week days. East of Salzburg the Mondsee the Moon Lake invites you for a visit. The shape resembles the young moon thus the name. The lake is especially inviting during the warm months when the water really heats up. The frequent winds also allow for kiting and sailing or you can just lazily take a ride with a boat around the 10km long lake. It is not difficult to find a place to sleep along the lake as the offer is very varied. I’ve decided for a budget friendly accommodation at Jugendgästehaus Mondsee which is a hostel the HI network is rightfully proud of. I found the hostel right away for the town is really not big. There were no problems with parking either. The square building is in a peaceful part of town just a short walk away from the city centre. The lake is near too and from the second floor I could even admire the view of it over the surrounding roof tops. Before the start of the season I was treated with all the luxury – I was all alone in a room for four. There were two bunk beds in the room which had its own bathroom. Otherwise the hostel features 21 rooms that can accommodate 80 people all together and each room has its bathroom. Three rooms are specially equipped to suit the people in wheel chair as well as the access to the entre and the restaurant. All of this is the result of the refurbishment three years ago. The hostel has no age limitations and you get a key to the front entrance allowing you to go out at night and return to your room regardless the time – but quietly during the night. The prices for a night start at 195€ and you can decide between a half and full board. The self-serving breakfast was ready for me in a huge dining room with walls decorated by citrus motives. The entrance and the reception on the other hand are in typical red colours – as are parts of the furniture and photographs. And not to forget another speciality I was greeted by the dog guests upon my arrival. The manager Gabi Hackl explained she has a dog and would feel really weird not to allow guests to bring their companions with them. »But naturally we don’t allow dogs in beds or the restaurant!« she remarked seriously when heading off for a morning walk with her four-legged friend. The hostel also organizes many activities and trips so the few days spent there pass really quickly. A film location The centre of the town features a smaller square next to the former monastery which is now a hotel. Along with colourful houses there’s also the church of St. Michael. Many people visit the Mondsee just to see the church as it was the setting to the wedding of the extremely popular Julie Andrews film The sound of Music. I guess most of current hostel visitors never saw the movie… I’ve met a group of Japanese tourists in front of the church enquiring where to get the traditional pastry – the Apple Strudel. I’ve sent them to the nearby pastry shop and I hope they were not disappointed. Apart from a dozen of shops and restaurants you can also see the open air museum with wooden houses typical for this part of Austria. The town also features a railroad museum dedicated to the track which use to connect the town with Salzburg. Mondsee is even on the UNESCO heritage list with the prehistoric Pile dwelling which however is today under the water. The resort town does hold some manifestation but apart from that the place to be is the Big Bamboo bar which has been providing musical events for visitors for the past 25 years now and is known way beyond the lake area. The Bar is close to the shore and the promenade park Almeida. Mondsee is very attractive in winter also. It’s less than half an hour away from Salzburg and close to the neighbouring ski slopes. Not to mention other large lakes nearby which of each offers something special.

A 660-kilometre network of trails leads through an enchanting landscape characterised by ancient beech forests mysterious marshes and huge expanses of water – including more than 130 lakes. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Müritz National Park in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is a stunningly beautiful region with countless lakes. It is also an important breeding ground for rare and endangered large birds – ideal for nature lovers and ornithologists. The chance of seeing rare animals close up such as the endangered white-tailed eagle pairs of ospreys in Federow and cranes makes any excursion along the numerous cycle and walking trails a voyage of discovery. In the eastern part of the national park near Serrahn there are even specially constructed hides where visitors can watch the wildlife. Swedish hornless cattle have been grazing near Müritzhof since 1969 as part of a trial with Gotland sheep being added in the 1980s. There are a large number of cycle trails on which to explore the region and the national park office regularly conducts guided walks. But visitors are not restricted to cycling or walking when it comes to discovering the new and unexpected as boats and canoes provide excellent alternatives. Larger pleasure boats are often able to accommodate bicycles on board. Canoeing trips on the Havel river and the Alte Fahrt circular route are an excellent way to get to know this rich and varied landscape. The Heinrich Schliemann Museum in Ankershagen is dedicated to the life and work of this famous archaeologist. The town of Waren with its old quarter and steamboat cruises is also well worth a visit. read more » « less Related topics Cycling Walking Nature & technology Discover more in the local region Uckermark Lakes Nature Park – go with the flow » The Queen Louise of Prussia Route – On royal trails » The Peene Valley River Landscape discoveries on land and water » The Vorpommern Village Route – The Amazon of the North » www.mueritz-nationalpark.de Copyrights Home Leisure and recreation Natural landscapes National parks Müritz National Park top of page Search at germany.travel Save route Share/forward route Print route Delete route Create new route My routes 0 View in Google route planner Unnamed route 0 DestinationsLength of route 0 kmDuration 0 Means of transport The route cannot be calculated.

What does Berlin have that other world cities dont? Well first of all theres the locals whose rough yet friendly charm is all part of the Berlin experience. Add to that an incredible array of sights that reflect not only the citys newfound swagger but also its great history and the dramatic events of the 20th century. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner When people think of Berlin the first thing that usually comes to mind is its most famous landmark – the Brandenburg Gate. For decades a symbol of division the monument has always been the beating heart of a major city bursting with ideas inspiration art culture and creativity. Highlights in the western parts of Berlin include the Kurfürstendamm as elegant a shopping street as youll find anywhere the Kaufhaus des Westens department store better known as KaDeWe on-trend boutiques and exclusive galleries as well as beautiful residential streets and of course Berlins famous nightlife. And speaking of nightlife no trip to Berlin would be complete without an evening at Friedrichstadt Palast Germanys leading variety theatre. The cosmopolitan vibe also permeates the government district which spreads out to the east from Brandenburg Gate and from the neighbouring Reichstag. Theres a sense of peace and freedom in the air here – in stark contrast to the days when Berlin was responsible for unthinkable crimes. The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe a work by New York architect Peter Eisenman located near the Brandenburg Gate serves as a reminder of those atrocities as does the Topography of Terror documentation centre at the former Gestapo headquarters. Berlins prestigious Unter den Linden boulevard extends eastwards from Brandenburg Gate towards Alexanderplatz square passing the Museum Island World Heritage site as well as Berlin Cathedral the Neue Wache and the baroque Zeughaus armoury which today houses the German Historical Museum. Keep going far enough and youll reach the TV tower which to this day remains the tallest structure in Germany. The view from the top stretching across Berlin and all the way to Brandenburg is a major sightseeing highlight. Nearby is Gendarmenmarkt widely lauded as Berlins most beautiful square. The German Cathedral the French Cathedral and the Concert Hall form an ensemble of great majesty and grandeur here. The atmosphere of the Hackesche Höfe also within the central Mitte district is somewhat less grand but all the more laid-back easygoing and relaxed for it. This retail complex is the largest series of enclosed courtyards in Germany and has been heritage-listed since 1977. For an authentic taste of Old Berlin explore the courtyards vibrant mix of art galleries cinemas theatres variety venues restaurants and bars not to mention all the welcoming little shops and big-name flagship stores. Theres also no escaping the citys artistic flair here. A characteristic that nearly a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall remains a defining feature perhaps more so than in any other capital. Berlin is the creative workshop of Germany a trendsetter and a capital of fashion design and music. The progressive spirit of optimism that engulfed the reunified city was – and still is – astounding. Hundreds of backyard art studios emerged from the shadows and art soon began to take over streets the walls of buildings and even entire districts. Famously artists have also appropriated the remains of the Berlin Wall the section from Oberbaum bridge to Ostbahnhof station now going by the name of East Side Gallery has become an illustrated encyclopaedia of street art. Today Kreuzberg Prenzlauer Berg Neukölln and Wedding are the districts of choice for more than 20000 artists. It is this creative force that lies behind the citys distinctive vibe – a vibe that renders Berlin the capital for alternative and established art alike. Immerse yourself in this creative cosmos. Let yourself be inspired seduced and enchanted. Get to know the people of Berlin. Besides all the sightseeing the locals are arguably the best reason to discover this incredible city – and the perfect excuse to come back and visit. read more » « less Highlights A passageway to history Brandenburg Gate » The elegance of power the government quarter in Berlin » Mixing with the stars the Berlinale film festival » A treasure trove of human history Berlins Museum Island » Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum » The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe » A taste of Old Berlin the Hackesche Höfe » All the way up Berlins TV tower » The show must go on Friedrichstadt-Palast » Quiet contemplation in the pleasure garden Berlin Cathedral » A memorial to peace the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church » For those with expensive tastes Quartier 206 » Two thousand years of German-Jewish history » German Historical Museum » Down the ages the Jewish Cemetery at Weissensee » A water sports paradise in the leafy suburbs Lake Wannsee » Berlin Wall » Berlin Philharmonic » Jewish Museum » Unter den Linden » German Historical Museum » Museum of Natural History Berlin » Germany Museum of Technology » Berlin Wall Memorial » Topography of Terror » DDR Museum » The Berlin- Hohenschönhausen Memorial » Related topics Museums Creative Shopping Top 100 Discover more in the local region Babelsberg Film Park – a touch of Hollywood » Palaces and parks of Potsdam and Berlin » Glienicke Palace & Park – a touch of the mediterranean on the Havel river. » Mildenberg brickworks centre and industrial culture park » Highlights close A passageway to history Brandenburg Gate No other monument in Berlin is as famous around the world as Brandenburg Gate built between 1789 and 1791 to plans by C.

The gate is supported by six Doric columns forming five passageways with pedestrian-only access. The famous quadriga depicting the goddess of victory Victoria riding a four-horse chariot was added in 1794. The elegance of power the government quarter in Berlin The route along Wilhelmstrasse right through the old and new government quarter and embassy district heads towards Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. The ministerial buildings and the Federal Chancellery in particular reflect the successful synthesis of the old with the new through prestigious yet modest elegance.

Saint John was tortured for a long time and his body then hurled from Charles Bridge in Prague into the River Vltava. The legend tells that five stars appeared above his head at that moment. Since that time stars and the number five have been regarded as symbols of this saint. Discover the Santini code This legend was used ingeniously by the architect Santini who designed the whole church on the floor plan of a five-pointed star. The symbol of the stars and number five appear in the building countless times. In the area around the arcade are five gates and five chapels in the church are five altars and on the high altar are five central stars. The whole complex is literally interwoven with mystical symbols and enigmas. Experts are to this very day still looking for the entrance to a secret corridor which allegedly led from the church to the monastery in the nearby Žďár Estate. Visit the New Generation Museum When visiting Zelená hora make sure to stop by at the former Cistercian monastery from the 13th century today a chateau bearing Santini’s legacy which includes the New Generation Museum a modern exposition combining experience elements with exhibits from prominent Czech institutions.

They are only an hour away from each other so we could get to know them in a few days. Linz is connected with the Danube river that was giving home to people for centuries even Romans started settling there. Linz was once a boring industrial centre and a lively port but is now also known as educational and cultural centre. Linz was an European capital of culture in 2009 and it met some big changes in that year. They renovated buildings industrial areas were brought to life they fixed up many parks and opened a few new museums. Ars Electronica Center was the one I found more attractive. Every science and new technology fan should stop there. They present new achievements and knowledge. A modern building is also an every-year meeting place of technologically-oriented artists at September festival Ars Electronica. It was built right above the Danube hill and overlooks at the old city centre. The museum is especially attractive at night when it is lighted with different colours and light effects. The same idea was also used on the modern gallery Lentos on the opposite hill. A shopping street Landstrasse is running by and the most interesting part of the street begins at the big square with plague column. The traffic is limited to trams. Because of them the smaller streets became more attractive that run parallel and are also home of many shops restaurants and coffee shops. Many parks and an attractive botanic gardens are also waiting for you in Linz. If you like to run bike or just walk there are many paths by the river Danube that lead from the city centre to the big port. The port was also livened up with many art projects mostly with big murals. Danube river invites you to see the city from the water on one of the tourist boats. We could sleep in HI hostel but because it was raining we decided to look for the sun in 150 kilometre far Salzburg. The weather was better and we found an accommodation in one of the four HI hostels not far from the city centre on Aigner street. The hostel is located in a calm neighbourhood and is surrounded by a big park. We were kindly welcomed at the reception and they gave us all the needed information for exploring the city despite the late hour. We rented a room with three beds and a big bathroom with two sinks. They were very useful. The hostel’s long hallways a staircase and the dining room were livened up by mosaics. The breakfast also stood out they offered enough choice even for vegetarians. The wi-fi was available only close to the reception where one will also find a room for hanging out. But this isn’t a minus as you have an opportunity to chat with other guests. Nearby is a bus stop so we parked the car on a free parking lot and explored the city by bus. But for a start we started just walking to the city centre which is 20 minutes away through one of the most green parts of the cities with a quiet neighbourhood and some parks. If we ate Linz cake in Linz the greatest temptation in Salzburg were Mozartkugels. Yes a lot of things are running around the most famous citizen Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. We visited his birth house his museum were amazed by the souvenirs walked on the Mozart Square where you can find a tourist office. There are also many baroque buildings churches palaces and mansions around the square. The most attractive is definitely Mirabell. You can find it on the other side of river Salzah that divides the city. If you like mansions you also have to visit the castle on the panoramic hill and mansion Hellbrun about 5 kilometres outside of the city. Its specialty are parks with waterfalls and fountains that were once a form of fun for aristocrats. The mansion is also called baroque Disneyland. Salzburg got its name after the salt mines nearby that brought big wealth to the city. Today Salzburg is a university city with many festivals that don’t just showcase classical music. Salzburg definitely offers many reasons to visit it. While getting to know both cities we used these two tourist discount cards Linz Card www.linz.at/english/tourism/5887.asp Salzburg Card www.salzburg.info/en/sights/salzburg_card As usual they offer free entrance to many museums free city buses and trams discounts at hostels restaurants events tours and many more.

Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner In the 17th century King Louis XIV of France was a champion of grandeur and decadence who presided over the most extravagant court in Europe . His Palace of Versailles provided the inspiration for many other residences of the European nobility. The absolutist rulers most fervent admirer was Bavarias fairytale king Ludwig II who did not just want to copy Versailles but to surpass it. In 1873 he found the means to buy idyllic Herrenwörth island in Lake Chiemsee the perfect place to let his imagination soar. Work on the fairytale palace which would become a refuge for the melancholy king began in 1878 to plans by the architect Georg Dollmann. The breathtaking interior is a work of pure extravagance in the French rococo style.

Having survived the years without damage or alteration this historical ensemble has now been granted UNESCO World Heritage status. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner You can almost smell the aromas of tea and coffee fine spices and all kinds of delicacies as you stroll through the district. It is a miniature city in itself a collection of warehouses built on thousands of oak piles between 1885 and 1927 in the neo-Gothic brick style. Narrow streets bridges and canals link together the worlds largest warehouse complex which once provided over 300000 square metres of storage space for all manner of goods at the heart of Hamburgs port. Reminders of a golden age Merchants didnt just need storage space however they also needed offices. And so they built the Kontorhäuser the first purely administrative buildings in Europe right next to the Speicherstadt. To this day the Kontorhäuser bear witness to the prosperity of the former trading dynasties. The most famous of them is the Chilehaus which was built using an incredible 4.8 million hand-layered bricks. Henry B. Sloman who had made his fortune trading saltpetre from Chile commissioned the architect Fritz Höger to design a spectacularly tall building with angled facades to resemble the bow of a ship. So much to see and do Both quarters the Speicherstadt and Kontorhaus district hold great attraction for tourists in the area between the Elbe Philharmonic Hall and HafenCity.

Reaching seemingly endlessly up into the sky Ulm Minsters tower has watched over the city for centuries. After the Second World War during which much of the city was destroyed Ulm took the right approach to reconstruction. The city planners achieved a successful compromise that resulted in a unique cityscape of lovingly restored buildings on the one hand and breathtaking modernity on the other. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Ulm Minster the finger of God with the highest church tower in the world is the citys predominant building. And the square on which it stands is an endlessly fascinating place that offers a great mix of historical and modern architecture. But there is definitely more to Ulm than the Minster and Münsterplatz square and at a stones throw away the beautiful town hall is one of the reasons why. The oldest part of the present building was erected in 1370 and served as a trading house. It was first mentioned as a town hall in 1419 and the ornate astronomical clock was added in around 1520. In the buildings stairwell you can look up and see a replica of the flying machine built by Albrecht Ludwig Berblinger the legendary tailor of Ulm. Unfortunately his attempts at flying more than 200 years ago were not crowned with success. On the crucial day there was no favourable wind and his flight ended in the gushing Danube. Nevertheless he is still esteemed today as an able man and the locals penchant for striking out in new directions – at least in spirit – is a reminder of another famous son of Ulm Albert Einstein. A new direction at least in terms of urban development was taken with the design of Ulms Neue Mitte new centre between Münsterplatz and the town hall. Here old and new buildings form an ensemble of striking contrasts. The first of these is the Stadthaus by New York architect Richard Meier. This internationally acclaimed milestone in modern architecture is an open house for encounters with art culture and people – and with a remarkable city. Its basement contains a fascinating permanent exhibition on the archaeology and history of Münsterplatz square providing a clear contrast to the architecture of the building itself. The House of Senses which features an opticians with a café on the third floor and affords fantastic views of the minster the Sparkasse building Wolfram Wöhrs Weishaupt art gallery the glass pyramid municipal library by Gottfried Böhm and the Obere Stube with its moving facade stand out against the nearby historical minster and town hall with their modern mode of expression – which was welcomed wholeheartedly by experts but divided opinion among Ulm residents. Further ahead via the Weinhof – an important trading house for almost 500 years – are the ancient Steinhaus stone house the Romanesque Chapel of St. Nicholas dating from around 1220 and the 17th-century Schwörhaus oath house. Every year on Schwörmontag a public holiday in Ulm the towns mayor stands on the Schwörhaus balcony and repeats the historic oath of 1397 to uphold the constitution. A walk through Ulm Museum is also fascinating. The archaeological collection boasts the Löwenmensch lion man the oldest animal/human sculpture in the world dating back approximately 30000 years and features alongside a collection of major European and American artworks from 1945 onwards. A distinctive feature of Ulms townscape are two towers that form part of the old town fortifications the Gänseturm goose tower and the Metzgerturm butchers tower built in 1345 and better known as the Leaning Tower of Ulm. The story behind the tower is typical of Ulm. Legend has it the tower got its name from the butchers who added sawdust to their sausage mix. When the townspeople realised this they locked the culprits in the tower. And as the corpulent butchers huddled together in fear in a corner upon the angry mayors entrance the tower is supposed to have tilted. In actual fact the tower is leaning because it stands on a former swamp. However you should try to stay upright when you visit the quaint fishermens quarter which dates from the Middle Ages or one of the many beer gardens in Ulm and Neu-Ulm – Ulms sister town in Bavaria on the other side of the Danube. But that is of course up to you. The main thing is that you visit Ulm. read more » « less Highlights Reaching for the skies Ulm Minster » Where Ulm has its roots the fishermens and tanners quarter » Visionary urban development in Ulms new centre » Delicious and nutritious the Breadmaking Museum » Discover more in the local region Frontiers of the Roman Empire Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes » Visit your favourite animal at Augsburg Zoo! » Le Corbusiers work – the houses in the Weissenhof housing estate » LEGOLAND Deutschland Resort the skys the limit when it comes to Lego! » Highlights close Reaching for the skies Ulm Minster The Gothic Minster has been a dominant feature in the centre of Ulm for centuries and is the towns most famous landmark. It is also known far and wide for having the tallest church tower in the world the Finger of God stretches up to the skies reaching a height of almost 162 metres. This stunning piece of architecture is complemented by a number of exquisite art treasures inside the church. The minster is also famous for its 15th century choir stalls by Jörg Syrlin. The carved busts in particular are considered masterpieces of art history. Where Ulm has its roots the fishermens and tanners quarter Set in an idyllic location at the confluence of the Blau and Danube rivers is the fishermens quarter. Resided in predominantly by craftsmen in the Middle Ages it is the main historical ensemble in the heart of Ulms old quarter. This is the site of the Franconian royal court established in around 800 and of Ulms royal palace which was first documented in 854. Its ancient lanes winding passageways half-timbered houses bridges and jetties give a real impression of what medieval life must have been like. The tributary of the river Blau is lined with an array of historical buildings from the towns past. Find out more about City-Highlights Visionary urban development in Ulms new centre The futuristic buildings in Ulms Neue Mitte new centre between Münsterplatz square and the town hall – such as architect Richard Meier’s marvellous Stadthaus the House of Senses and the Sparkasse building both by Stephan Braunfels Weishaupt art gallery by architect Wolfram Wöhr the glass pyramid municipal library by Gottfried Böhm and the new Obere Stube – strike a deliberate contrast to the nearby historical minster and town hall with their modern mode of expression. The fascinating effect of this bold urban development still draws plenty of attention today and has earned the approval of international experts. Find out more about City-Highlights Delicious and nutritious the Breadmaking Museum The Breadmaking Museum in the historical salt storehouse in Ulm was founded by the entrepreneur Willy Eiselen in 1955 as the first bread museum in the world. It features a collection of 14000 objects which document the history of bread its importance to mankind and its manufacturing process. The exhibits explore the history of bread-making technology and the equipment used models of all kinds of baked goods and the diverse relationship between bread and art – including why we still to this day use the phrase breadless arts.

Indeed it was the ambitious sailing voyages of the early 19th century that led to the founding of the town in 1827. Today Bremerhaven preserves a great deal of Germanys maritime heritage as a shipbuilding centre international port and setting for important museums research institutes and cultural organisations. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner From Bremerhaven to the New World The city of Bremen situated 60 kilometres upriver from the coast required a sea port and so purchased land from the Kingdom of Hannover where it then proceeded to build a harbour basin. The docks continued to grow and the young town became a major port for fishing and international shipping. Leading the way was the service from Bremerhaven to New York which was operated by Bremens celebrated Norddeutscher Lloyd company with huge passenger liners. Millions of emigrants hoping to find better lives in the USA or South America said their final farewell to the old continent in Bremerhaven. For many the last glimpse of land would have been the Brinkamahof lighthouse which then stood outside the borders of the town. In 1980 it was moved six kilometres to the fishing harbour to become a new Bremerhaven landmark and also the towns smallest bar. Lighthouses and many other aspects of maritime life are the subject of the Historical Museum of Bremerhaven. The building – an attraction in itself with its bold visionary architecture – is situated in one of the prettiest parts of the town right in the centre but in a quiet leafy spot. Adopting a modern interactive concept it explores the past present and future of an entire region through realistic multifaceted exhibitions. The museum opened in 1906 marked its centenary in 2006 and continues to be a leading attraction in the town. A benevolent spirit for sailors in days gone by Bremerhaven is also home to the mythical Klabautermann who protects sailors at sea. This diminutive character can be seen in a fountain close to the German Maritime Museum. According to folklore this barely two-foot tall imp is the spirit of someone who died and whose soul took up residence in a tree. Should this tree become a mast of a ship the spirit will become a Klabautermann and watch over the ship and the crew even if it can occasionally lose its temper. An endearing legend – and one that could surely only have originated in a maritime town such as Bremerhaven. read more » « less Highlights The German Emigration Centre bidding farewell to the old world » Klimahaus® Bremerhaven blowing hot and cold » Bremerhaven Harbour Worlds Harbour life from a new perspective » Shipping museums and museum ships » Discover more in the local region Horst Janssen Museum Oldenburg » Bremen Bürgerpark.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Karavanke Karavanke View mountains on Austrian side of Karavanke For mountaineers Austria is among the most beautiful countries in the world. It offers endless possibilities for mountaineering and other outdoor activities. Its clean safe with accessible nature… all the reasons Slovenian mountain lovers like to visit it over and over again. Karavanke They are the longest Slovenian mountain range with the length of 120km. The ridge of it is also the national border between Slovenian and Austria thus the tallest peak Stol 2236m belongs to both countries. There are two important mountain passes crossing this part of the Alps – Jezersko and Ljublelj. These two passes were considered important trade routes in ancient times already. Ljubelj is also one of the first road passes in Europe and there’s a known motorway tunnel under the Alpine massive connecting two countries and shortening the travel. The lookout peaks are equipped” with mountain lodges and feature many well marked paths. They are offering great opportunities for hikers who are attracted mostly by the excellent view on landscapes on both sides of the border. There are some peaks that are in Slovenia only and some that are only in Austria yet most Slovenian mountaineers don’t know about Austrian peaks although they have native names in both languages. Freiberg / Setiče It’s a lone peak and one of the most beautiful mountains on the Austrian side of Karavanke. It’s a mountain with a great view with just under 2000m above sea level. It is however a bit more difficult for hiking to the top. The shortest path takes two and a half hours and you’ll cover the altitude difference of over 900 meters. Austrians have many forest roads which are closed for traffic. They are for farmers and forest workers only. That’s the case here too. The forest road does lead to a hunting cabin which is only about an hour under the top but you are not allowed to drive there. Those who made it to the top say it is like out of a fairy tale. The soft grass centuries old pines and above all larch trees with the view opening to all sides… and the especially a beautiful view of Košuta which seems to be on the palm of your hand make all the effort needed to come to the top well worth it even if the way there is steap. Obir and its attractions The massif of Obir is one of the most famous in Austrian part of Karavanke. The most popular and visited by Slovenian is the peak Ojsterc with 2139m of altitude. Under the top there is the famous mountain lodge Eisenkappler hütte which you can reach by car if you pay the extra toll. The lodge is also the starting point to reach all of the peaks of Obir. The paths are not difficult and everybody can venture on them. A well-known and well-marked path is also the nature learning path. In the past the mountains featured lead mines which are now abandoned and are only used as shelters in case of bad weather. From the top you get a great view even of the Visoke Ture if the weather is clear enough. And the mountain range doesn’t only offer great tops but also interesting underground world. There you’ll find the tourist cave Obirska jama and also the waterfalls Obirski slap and Podkanjski slap. Also very attractive and popular is the accumulation lake Borovniško jezero. And plant lovers will get to see the speciality in its own right the obirski grobeljnik. Other peaks Mountaineers climbers skiers nature lovers… have also many other peaks to visit. There are so many you will probably not be able to visit them all. In between them there are also many lakes where you can relax and in most of them you are allowed to swim too. Austria is famous for its great tourism offer which you can witness throughout the Karavanke which belong to the territory of Koroška. Karavanke stretch all the way to the city of Beljak on the Austrian side. As the city itself is also very interesting as it offers historical and other attractions I suggest you book into the hostlu Villach. From there you can go on many daily trips to the mountains with excellent views and other great offer which changes with the seasons.

This UNESCO World Natural Heritage site covers an area of around 11000 square kilometres and includes the three Wadden Sea National Parks of Schleswig-Holstein Lower Saxony Hamburg and Denmark plus the Wadden Sea conservation area in the Netherlands. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Mussel beds dense sea grass meadows and soft mudflats provide food for many animals. Flowering salt marshes in the transitional zone along the dykes and on the islands and Hallig islets give way to white sandy beaches and dunes. For millions of migratory birds the Wadden Sea is an essential stopover or resting place. Geologically it is a very young area only 10000 years old and is constantly being re-shaped by the winds and tides. High and low tide alternate every six hours transforming the landscape as if by magic. You can witness this at any time of year! The changing water levels make it possible to walk right out onto the mudflats and across to the islands that lie just off the coast. On a walk through the mudflats ideally with an experienced guide you can feel the interaction of wind water and waves and watch huge flocks of birds demonstrating their aerial prowess. In the distance you can sometimes even watch seals sunning themselves on a sandbank.

Energy for the mine was supplied by the Upper Harz water management system the worlds foremost pre-industrial water management system for the mining industry. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Producing almost 30 million tonnes of ore the Rammelsberg mines shaped the history and development of the town of Goslar in the Harz region they also led Emperor Heinrich II to establish an imperial palace here. The first imperial assembly in Goslar took place in 1009 and the town remained a royal seat for German kings and emperors until 1253. In 1988 after more than 1000 years of virtually non-stop mining the ore extraction was stopped. Today it lives on in a museum of impressive scale and authenticity. Not quite so big but just as authentic is Goslars old town whose enchanting skyline is dominated by the mighty Romanesque palace and the towers of no fewer than 47 churches and chapels. The preserved townscape is dominated by elegant guildhalls reflecting the wealth of the citizens by the historical town hall and by timber-framed houses with ornamental carvings. In 2010 the World Heritage site was expanded to include Walkenried Abbey the historical Grube Samson mine in St. Andreasberg and the Upper Harz water management system. The latter considered a masterpiece of early mining and engineering artistry consists of 107 historical ponds 310 kilometres of ditches and 31 kilometres of waterways. It is one of the largest pre-industrial power supply facilities in the world.

Clean simple lines. Antique motifs. Beauty harmony the ideal. All these are hallmarks of the Classicist and Empire styles. Enter a dream world the endless search for the ideal! Our forebears found this ideal in the form of Classicism and the Empire style. These sober simple styles preferring strict symmetry were the exact opposite of the restless curvy Baroque. They were applied in urban design and the architecture of newly-built theatres and spas. Download guides and brochure Read More Chateaux in the Antique style Harmony clean beauty and the use of motifs from ancient Greece and Rome are the key features of Classicism and Empire. Do they seem too simple too austere? Then go and take a look at Kačina Chateau near Kutná Hora and you’ll change your mind! This grandly laid-out chateau the most beautiful Empire chateau in the Czech Republic is designed in the form of a 227 m long crescent. The main building is joined to two symmetrical single-storey wings with colonnades and pavilions. Similar ideals were held by the architects who designed Kynžvart Chateau a Viennese-style Classicist palace built on the orders of the famous Chancellor Metternich. In the chateau you will see the famous Cabinet of Curiosities and the chateau gardens boast several ponds a Neo-Gothic chapel a gazebo with a view and a number of statues. You can also go for a round of golf. The Garden of Europe and inch-perfect towns Classicism soon became the style of choice for normal urban buildings in fact some towns or districts were designed purely in this style. Worth a look are the Estates Theatre in Prague and Františkovy Lázně which has thanks to its Classicist architecture and white and yellow tones retained the magic and atmosphere of an old-time spa centre! A special atmosphere can be experienced in the towns of Terezín and Josefov with their regular network of streets and squares both constructed according to similar designs.

That was what the citizens of Olomouc had in mind when creating the Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc. This column which was included in the UNESCO monument list due to its historical and artistic value is the largest free-standing Baroque sculpture in Central Europe. Download guides and brochure More info For more information please contact Information center Horní náměstí Upper Square Town Halls archway +420585513385 infocentrum@olomouc.eu tourism.olomouc.eu/welcome/en Read More Its height and monumentality will captivate you at first glance. It is so large that there is even a small chapel hidden in its bowels. When the power of art is stronger than a cannon ball The story of the column in Olomouc is an unsettled one. The stimulus for its construction was one of the most extreme bouts of the plague which hit Moravia at the start of the 18th century. Although the city already had one plague column at that time the citizens thought it was not spectacular enough. Once it was finished the Holy Trinity Column immediately became a source of immeasurable pride for the people of Olomouc who already at that time uncovered its unique nature and artistic value. Their love for this work was so great that when the city was under siege they set out to plead with the Prussian general to tell his soldiers not to shoot at their column. The liberal general accommodated their wishes and so you can feast your eyes on the original beauty of this place to this very day. A Baroque gallery in the open air The Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc was conceived on the basis of the symbolism of the heavenly hierarchy. Over three levels you can see statues of saints relief work depicting the apostles and the personification of the Virtues. Above them you can see the sculptural group of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and at the very top of the column is the dominant feature of the Holy Trinity. The fact that the empress Maria Theresa also participated in the consecration of the column is further testament to its importance. All you need do is take a seat… In order to feel the true atmosphere of elegant Olomouc all you need do is take a seat at the foot of the Holy Trinity Column and watch what is going on around you. The magnificent city palaces the pleasant cafes and the ubiquitous students from the local universities provide the perfect backdrop for this monumental and at the same time harmonious Baroque work of art.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Vienna architecture and classical music Vienna architecture and classical music After driving for less than 400 kilometers from Ljubljana through a heavy mid July downpour which forced most drivers to stop along the way we’ve reached the capital of once mightiest country in Europe during the reign of Charles V in 15th century. The traffic runs smoothly thanks to the wide three lane highways and organized public transports that includes trams and underground trains thus we didn’t believe we’ve reached the center of the town for the lack of the traffic jams. At that point I realized my Nomad navigation was completely unusable. The history of the city Vienna is the capital of Austria and the state capital of one of nine states of Austria. It has a little less than two and a half million of population and s the political economical and cultural center of the country. Originally a Celtic settlement from 2500 years ago became a border city of the Roman Empire 15 years before the current year count which was meant to defend the Empire from Germanic raids. In 13th century the vast Mongolian Empire was threatening it but after the death of their ruler the Mongols left never to return again. In Middle Ages the city became the home of the Banbenburg family and in 1440 the Habsburgs took it over. It was then the city became the capital of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nationality. In 16th and 17th century the Turkish army tried to conquer the city and besieged it on two separate occasions. When Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the Holy Roman Empire the city became the capital of the Austrian Empire and in 1867 of Austro-Hungary once the country got divided into these two parts. After the Great War in city became the capital of Austrian Republic but when the country was forced into the Third Reich the city lost the status of a capital until 1945 when it again became the capital of the Republic of Austria. The sights of the city At a hostel or a tourist info point take a map of the city where the special buildings attractive to the eye and lens are marked. I suggest you have a camera with at least 5 time optical zoom otherwise you might not be able to capture the things you want to in the objective. If you don’t feel like walking all the way you can rent a bicycle at the city hall for the price of just a few Euros. Your artistic sense should point out the architecture to you for most of Vienna really has beautiful 18th century architecture. It’s called the Biedermeier style the main artistic style in literature music furniture and painting from between the years of 1815 the great congress in Vienna and 1848 the year of national movements across the Europe. It’s on the level of British regency American federal and French empyreal period. We might say since they are all similar it’s just one artistic movement that got different names in different countries but due to different artists there is also some variety to it making it even more interesting. Otto Wagner was the main architect of the city and was mostly active at the end of 19th century. The center and beauty of the city lays on the south bank of Danube with five city parks. The biggest of them is the Stadtpark with an area of 65.000 m2. When it was opened in 1862 it became the first public park in Vienna. It’s also used for dances concerts congresses and there’s a restaurant in it. A gilded bronze statue of Johann Strauss II stands in the park where he had conducted one of his concerts. Strauss II. was a composer of operettas and dance music who wrote 500 waltzes polkas and other compositions including librettos and ballets. He got famous as the king of waltzes already in his own lifetime and is mainly responsible for the popularization of the Viennese waltz. No wonder his statue is one of better known and photographed ones. The park itself can boast with most statues and monuments at one place in the entire city along with the variety of flowers and trees including rare specimens like the wind hazelnuts from the Caucasus. If you however want fun you should go to the Prater park which has the amusement park with the giant wheel with a great view over the entire city. A closer inspection of the map shows us the most luxurious and beautiful buildings are placed around the Heldenplatza in front of the royal palace. Two colossal statues of horsemen and many tourist carriages stand there to take you around the city in the manner people traveled before cars came into everyday use. Originally the palace of the government is now a national museum that has the empyreal crown and jewels on display. The parliament was built at the end of 19th century in the classical Greek style which includes the gilded copy of the goddess Athena. The statue might symbolize democracy which originates from Athens. The city hall might surprise you for at first glance it resembles a cathedral due to its shape and steeples but it is not. The three most famous churches of the city are Votiv St. Stephen and Charles’ church the main object of which includes pyramid worship indicating the influence of the free masons. All the buildings even get a special dimension after dark once the reflectors hit them. The fountains statues and domes of buildings can be very splendorous as well for some of them are also gilded. In the parks you’ll get to see famous people from the past times such as Mozart Beethoven Goethe Strauss and many others. There are several opera houses in the city The Vienna theatre the City opera house and the National opera house with the Vienna musical society building and Vienna concert house hosting concerts of classical music as well. There are also several museums from the former empyreal palace Hofburg museum Sisi dedicated to empress Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie with empyreal living quarters National-history museum and many museums in the museum quarter of the city with the Museum of national art Leopold’s museum and the palace of Liechtenstein with one of the largest private baroque painting collections in the world. You can also visit the Belvedere castle exhibiting the erotic paintings of Gustav Klimt and works of Egon Schiel and Franz Xavier Messerschmidt along with many painters of the early 20th century Military museum technical museum and the museum of the clock of Vienna. In short – you won’t be missing any cultural sights but as the proverb goes a picture is worth a thousand words. All the car lovers might be somewhat disappointed though for I haven’t seen a single noteworthy car during my four day stay. It’s not Paris Dubai Monaco so there’s very little chance to see a Bugatti Pagani zonda Bentley McLaren or Lamborghini. Food and souvenirs There is a huge market place in the city but fruit and vegetables are too expensive there. It’s much cheaper to buy in stores like Billa. There are many stands with fast food and some spaghetti houses but most of all there are Chinese restaurants. There are many in general many restaurants around the city from virtually all over the world but I couldn’t find a Brazilian restaurant. There are quite a lot vegetarian and vegan restaurants but it’s easier to Google them in advance. The souvenirs are not expensive they are even surprisingly cheap. Conclusion Vienna is definitely a city worth a visit. With many universities and schools you can even stay there and get an education or maybe even a job and will never be bored. To me the whole city is just like made for walks. There’s also a lot of entertainment and I especially liked the amusement park. Typical for Vienna there’s always a concert there out in the open or in a hall a theatre performance or even children theatre opera or museum. go see it it’s not far and you will not regret it.

A friend and I woke to the Ljubljana fog that –except for the cold – didnt feel wintery. We put the last things in our backpacks and went to the station from where we should depart. When all the travellers were gathered the bus driver turned the key and pressed the pedal so we were off to the 280 kilometre drive to Salzburg which passed by quickly. In just over four hours with some short breaks we arrived to the city of the Mozartkugeln. Under the magnificent mountains at the river of Salzach the city of Salzburg where history and art meet is located. In the European scope the town with 15.000 people is easily explored. You don’t need a mat just a bit of orientation and follow the smell of cinnamon and sound of yelling kids… and after dark the glow of lights. You can’t get lost. Mirabell palace We got off at the bus station under the hill of Festungsberg that dominates over the town and crossed the river of Salzach. We crossed the river over the famous Makartsteg bridge where the railings are covered by padlocks placed there by couples in love who made sure their hearts stay together. We continued towards the palace Mirabell and admired the beauty of carefully tended garden from far away. The palace and the fortress Hohensalzburg are on top of the Festungsberg staring at each other with a beautiful garden between them also with the river and the city at the foot of the hill. The palace was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau who probably couldn’t imagine this will be turned into a concert hall four centuries later where theatre productions take place and where people come to get wed. The palace is used by the mayor and the city council of Salzburg. Even if you don’t get to see the inside of the palace you’ll be amazed by the exterior the architecture and the beautiful gardens under the protection of UNESCO. Get your camera ready you’ll have much work for it as there are many moments that should be captured and framed. Mozart’s birth house and residence We again crossed the river Salzach but on one of the many other bridges and returned to the foot of the mountain. As you just can’t leave the town without tasting the birth place of one of the biggest composers the Mozartkugel we went and had some. And I tell you there’s no place in the world where they would taste the same as in the birth town of Mozart in his house sitting on the sofa listening to a gifted musician while at work. It was as if young Mozart got reborn to play just for the two of us. The house where on January 27th in 1756 the famous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart first saw the light of the day is located in the Getreidegasse. You can see many documents and portraits of the family and also their instruments. There is also a residence in the town where Mozart lived between 1773 and 1780. It is located yet again on the other side of the river Salzach and there you can walk among his instruments notes and furniture. Fortress Hohensalzburg On top of the hill Festungsberg stands a mighty 11th century fortress. It’s one of the town symbols and the largest perfectly preserved medieval European fortress. You can walk to the fortress and lose your breath or you can leave the city hustle and get to the mighty walls in matter of minutes by taking the cable cart. We took the cart. The view from the fortress is magnificent and all the – just a moment before mighty – buildings seem to be made of lego bricks and the people as ants. You can also go and see the inside of the fortress where the visitors get to explore the bishop’s chapel golden hall golden chamber and the bishop’s bed chambers with original furniture and interior design. We didn’t enter because we rather went to explore the Christmas fair in the courtyard and marvelled at the town from almost bird’s eye view. Old heart of Salzburg The town gets its Christmas image in the second half of November already and attracts people from near and far. They offer tours of exploring the city for several days and you can visit the beer museum Stiegl Stiegl Brauwelt the natural history museum Haus der Natur Red Bull Hangar-7 or go to the old salt mine in Halleinu pri Salzburgu. If you decide to stay for a few days I suggest you make yourself comfortable in one of the city’s four HI hostels that will welcome you under their roof. The town is also a great one day city escape. Seeing the main attractions hanging around cafés drinking hot chocolate eating Mozartkugeln and sipping Gluhwein are especially magical in the days of advent in the city of Salzburg. You can also visit the skate ring in the centre of the town usually attracting children of all ages. Around the skating ring – especially after dark – there are people with frosty noses and in gloves enjoying a glass or two of warm cooked wine. Just a few metres away there’s two colourfully decorated Christmas trees inviting you to enter one of the largest Christmas fairs with a rich variety of homemade specialities. I will definitely remember Salzburg as the city with the smell of cinnamon and for the nice and joyful people who live there and share their warmth despite freezing winter cold.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria Alpine lake with a touch of Mediterranean Alpine lake with a touch of Mediterranean Lake Boden is among the biggest lakes in Central Europe and is a border between Germany Switzerland and Austria. It covers the area of around 500 km2 so it is not surprising it reminds us of the sea when we first see it. Especially with the boats fares and sailboats constantly moving about the surface with many lovers of windsurfing and kiting enjoying the constant wind. The comfort of a hostel I’ve started exploring the lake – or better said attractive places around its shore – on the Austrian side. First I spent a night in a quiet resort in Hard. At the river bank you’ll find a HI hostel. It is in a modern building next to the sport center thus it often hostess various sport teams. Most rooms are comfortable have their own bathroom and even a TV – and a direct access to the attractive terrace. There are up to 6 beds per room which are roomy and equipped for handicapped as well. In the summer you should book ahead for the hostel is well visited and has the lowest prices around especially if compared to the similar hostels in Switzerland. Hostel is a great base to start exploring the lake and its surroundings. It’s only a short walk away from the shore of the lake the marina restaurants… It’s also a great starting point for visiting the cycling routes. You can go along the naturally preserved shore over the river of Ren to the nudist beach and only five kilometres further there is Bregenz one of the largest cites on the shore of the lake. The James Bond trail Bregenz is proud of its attractive city center wedged between the rail station and the harbour. There also a promenade in the shade connecting the two a point where young and old gather for decades. This is also the stage of the Opera on water! One of the world’s largest stages on the water attracts tens of thousands visitors annually who come to the Bregenz festival Festspiele every July and August. The spectacular setting impressed the movie makers so much they placed the 2008 James Bond Quantum of Solace in the opera. The scene and production runs for two years and 2012 is the second year for Umberto Giordano’s Andre Chenier. By water or air ship Exploring the Boden Lake by water is far most comfortable. For a few day travel you should buy the BodenseeErlebniskarte which allows free lake transports and entrance to some of the many museums – as well as other tourist discounts. The first interesting city is just a half an hour sail away – the German Lindau with the old centre on an island. Next stop is one of the bigger cites Friedrichshafen which is also a railroad crossroad and even has an airport. The city is famous for the museum of Zeppelins which connected Europe and North America before WWII. These airships were constructed by Ferdinand von Zeppelin who was born at the lake capital of Konstanca. If you’re interested you should try the special surprise the city offers – flights over the lake in reconstructions of several original designs! The prices are not too budget friendly but it is a special feeling you should try. I felt like floating through clouds while being in an enclosed gondola navigating through a picturesque landscape. But coming down to the shore you really should visit Meersburg with its mansion and Konstanca with its harbour. Konstanca is also an Univerity city so it’s always full of youngsters. There are many festivities in the city during the summer. The flower lovers should also visit the nearby island of Mainau with its beautiful gardens and arboretum. Visit the grand duke Hard is also a great place from which to visit Liechenstein – only 50km away. This miniature state does not look much different than the surrounding Austrian or Swiss places around it. Still Vaduz is one of the smallest capitals in the World. It has a very attractive promenade in the old town centre with many shops and restaurants. The modern parliament and the old town hall will also catch your attention. You can also visit the tourist office and get a stamp in your passport the border doesn’t give them for years anymore. But get this – you’ll have to pay to get the stamp in your passport. They prefer the Swiss franks which are here the official currency but also accept Euro. The prices are similar as in Switzerland - expensive! There are several museums in the town postal national skiing… there’s a few castles and some attractive mountain villages. There are many cycling and mountain paths for recreation climbing as high as 2000m. And before I forget here like along the lake itself there are several vineyards with some quite good wines.

The height of neo-Gothic architecture. Fortified with a multitude of towers and turrets Hohenzollern Castle sits in splendour almost 900 metres above the Swabian Alb. This is a storybook fortress from the heyday of the neo-Gothic. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner On a balmy summer evening in 1819 the 24-year-old Prussian Crown Prince saw the crumbling walls of his forefathers castle and decided to have it rebuilt. The future king Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia was a clever enterprising man with a passion for the fine arts. His heart belonged to the Middle Ages which led him to commission leading Berlin architect Friedrich August Stüler to rebuild the castle. Stüler sought inspiration from medieval architecture in France and England where the Gothic Revival or neo-Gothic style was very much in vogue. Building work began in 1852 and the restoration was completed in 1867. There are 140 rooms in the castle most notably the library with its murals the Kings bedroom a family tree hall and the Queens Blue Salon. This has a stunning gilded coffered ceiling an exquisite marquetry floor and portraits of Prussian queens. Prussian memorabilia displayed in the royal treasury includes the crown worn by Kaiser Wilhelm II. A painted Hohenzollern family tree adorns the walls of the castles entrance hall. The Prussian kings German emperors and their descendants are documented through to the present day. Nearby attractions dont miss Ulm Münster whose spire is the tallest in the world at just over 161 metres. Most of the building work was completed between 1377 and 1543 and it has retained its original character to this day. The town of Villingen-Schwenningen has a medieval centre an early-Gothic minster a late-Gothic town hall the Franciscan Museum and a town hall to discover. read more » « less Discover more in the local region Ludwigsburg Palace.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria A town in midst of Alps A town in midst of Alps A visit to Tyrol I’ve visited Innsbruck several times but since I liked it so much I’ve decided to return there once more and present it to you. Well I did have other reasons too. I love cycling but cycling really really fast and the air of Ljubljana started bothering my lungs so I wanted to go to the other side of the Alps to where the air is clean! After some 500 kilometers and seven hours of train rides I’ve arrived at Telf just a stone’s throw away from Innsbruck the regional economic administrative and cultural center of Tyrol. If you’ll drive through the region on Austrian highways you’ll see a flashing sign for 100km/h warning you to slow down – but not because the road would get dangerous but to reduce pollution. It’s a preventive action to preserve the environment – but the fines for speeding are no lower as they shouldn’t be. Innsbruck is the biggest city in Tyrol and fifth biggest in Austria after Vienna Graz Linz and Salzburg with its 120.000 people. It’s in the middle of a long but narrow valley with tall mountains on the sides even higher than 2500m. A place to feel good... Unlike the air in my native Ljubljana this air is cleaner and lung friendlier for there’s basically no smog here maybe only for a few days in a year. Hopefully it will stay that way for the number of population keeps growing mostly due to Turkish and Chinese immigration in search for a better future. Traditionally they’re preserving the environment separating waste to the most detailed subgroups. And not only that’s it’s beautiful almost everybody speaks English – for tourism plays a vital role in the economy. If you wish to stay active there’s even a 24 hour fitness studio so if you can’t sleep… But if you’re a martial arts buff better go across the border to Germany. But if you simply enjoy contact sports you might try boxing in Innsbruck – as a sport in the ring naturally. A University city Innsbruck is an ideal place for somebody who wants to get a university degree in many a branch. You pay for tuition but the studies are for free. Illogical? Well every student get’s a scholarship but sets aside a part of it to pay for tuition so there’s enough left to live. Yes it’s true. It’s not all as it seems at the first glance. You’ll not be missing a classical burek if you study here for they’ve spread across Europe just like Balcan beats which play in Innsbruck discos at night. Unfortunately not every study is available so for machine engineers you have to go to Graz or Vienna. There is a manager school here though like it was in Kumrovec in our Yugoslavian days where you gain political skills. An Olympic city The city hosted winter Olympics twice in 1964 and 1976 making it the only city to host the game twice within a dozen years apart the ancient Greek games at mount Olympus. In 1999 they hosted the biggest snow boarding spectacle of the world »Air & Style Contest« and were one of the places for the 2008 UEFA European championship in football. There’s a whole lot of goings-on in the fields of sports and culture either high ranking events or simply just a lively local scene at the stations or squares. Austrians spend a lot of money on culture which is obvious from the numerous theatres in the city. There’s the State theatre the City theatre the Kellertheater Knight games the Western-Rail theatre the Melon... And there are also many museums the castle Ambras State museum of Tyrol National arts museum City museum the Royal hunting museum the museum of anatomy… and many parks like Alpenzoo Hofgarten Rapoldi Schlosspark Abras Pechegarten Wilten and Beselepark. »Hallo Grüß Gott …« The local transport runs like clockwork. Apart from the bus they also have the tram system all also well connected to the main railroad station and the airport. So walking or cycling around town there might be airplanes just a few feet above your head. It’s a very friendly environment for tourists both biologically as socially. The nature is beautiful the air is clean – especially in neighboring mountains. There’s a lot of sunshine and if not it’s only rainclouds above. The people are open and welcoming even the girls greet back on the street although they don’t know you. It’s even more obvious in smaller places where everybody greets everybody else. The city center is beautiful with many pedestrian zones many fountains and benches to relax and enjoy the view. It’s a beautiful city with a big center. So if you want a healthy place with Alps around with no traffic jams and friendly people… then Tyrol is the choice you should consider as a holiday destination or maybe even permanent settlement in either Innsbruck or one of the small neighboring places. But if not in the city you might have to take the bus train or even a bike to the center. Oh and btw who makes the best mountain bikes in the world? KTM Austria.

Holašovice situated in the middle of the harmonious landscape of Southern Bohemia is surely the most charming village in the whole of the Czech Republic. The pride of this place is the wonderful Baroque farms set around the extensive village green which even ensured inclusion of Holašovice in the UNESCO world heritage list. Download guides and brochure Address Infocentrum Holašovice Holašovice 43 373 84 Dubné GPS 48.970624 14.272447 Phone +420 387 982 145 infocentrumholasovice@seznam.cz www.holasovice.eu Read More It sounds unbelievable but Holašovice has retained the same number of buildings for the whole 800 years of its existence. To this very day you can thus see 17 farms with barns and stables but also a blacksmith’s two taverns and the small Chapel of St. John of Nepomuk. But the village is no open-air museum. Most of the houses here are inhabited permanently and the locals hold several cultural events among which the Shrovetide festival in February Building of the Maypole in April and the Rural Festival in July with its Old Bohemian Fair stand out. Gables which look like lacework The village gained its current appearance in the 19th century when the local rural class escaped from servitude and the farmers could thus afford to convert their houses in the flamboyant style of the so-called Rural Baroque. Gaily coloured gables thus began to bloom on what was originally an austere medieval village green elaborated down to the very last detail which people nowadays come from all over the world to admire. Take more than just memories away with you When touring Holašovice make sure to also visit farm number 6. In the farm here you can see what rural life was like and how the people farmed until the 1st half of the 20th century. Don’t forget to visit the cosy ceramics workshop too where you can have an original mug jug cup or nameplate for your door made or a number for your house with typical Southern Bohemian motifs. A magical place from Celtic mythology Do you like mysterious places charged with strange energy? Then set out for the Holašovice Stonehenge”. A beautiful view opens out over the surrounding area from this Celtic stone circle built on a raised point above the village. You will see not only Holašovice itself but also the powerful silhouette of one of the most beautiful of Czech chateaux Hluboká nad Vltavou. You can above all enjoy the unique atmosphere of this place during solstice celebrations. Where else to go? From Holašovice it is not far to another Czech UNESCO monument.

The baroque influenced Czech architecture visual art literature theatre and music and gave rise to churches massive monasteries palaces and chateaux that changed the fact of Czech towns and villages. Prague too was given a Baroque makeover – and who doesn’t know the Prague baroque? Dientzenhofer and Santini Remember these two names because without them the Czech Baroque wouldn’t enjoy the excellent reputation that it does. Amongst the works by Christoph Dientzenhofer and his son Kilian Ignaz are for example the Church of St. Nicholas in the Lesser Quarter in Prague called the most beautiful Baroque church in Prague and one of the most valuable Baroque structures in Europe. The Loreta pilgrimage site in Prague with its world-famous carillon Plasy Monastery the Benedictine monastery in Broumov and Ploskovice Chateau also bear their imprint. One peculiarity of the Czech lands not found anywhere else is Baroque Gothic combining both styles into a harmonic whole. The master of this style was the architect Jan Blažej Satini many of whose buildings have been entered on the UNESCO list for example the Church of St. John of Nepomuk on Zelená hora or the Cathedral of the Assumption of Our Lady in Kutná Hora-Sedlec and the nearby All Saints’ Chapel beneath which can be found the picturesque ossuary. Theatre statues and so on The art of the baroque also influenced other areas. Visitors can admire for example the marvellous Baroque theatre at the chateau in Český Krumlov. Ostentatious Baroque terraces and balustrades can be viewed at Vrtba Garden and other gardens in the Lesser Quarter in Prague. For a true open-air gallery of the Baroque see the thirty Baroque statues on Charles Bridge the allegorical statues of Virtue and Vice in Kuks and another UNESCO site the Column of the Holy Trinity in Olomouc. The interiors of the chateaux in Slavkov u Brna historically Austerlitz Vranov nad Dyjí and Kroměříž.

A city of emperors and princes leaders and followers inventors and scholars Nuremberg has mirrored German history ever since the Middle Ages – the power the tension great achievements and great tragedies. Protected by the castle arts and crafts once flourished while a new spirit of freedom enlivened the city at a time when few other places could offer such a quality of life. And the same is still true today. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Nuremberg and its castle to this day the cityscape is dominated by the mighty fortress begun in 1140 during the reign of Emperor Conrad III and continually expanded until the 17th century. Every year hundreds of thousands of visitors journey back in time to the early modern period and the Middle Ages – eras that live on in Nuremberg. Nurembergs Historical Mile ends or begins at the castle and anybody following this tour will be astounded by the number of important buildings and monuments in the city the mighty city fortifications the glorious ornately decorated churches the elaborate fountains and the legacies of international trade. Theres also the Fembohaus featuring the City Museum and the Tucher Mansion – maintained with such authenticity you would be forgiven for thinking the former occupants had just popped out for a stroll. Centuries ago Nuremberg became an early hub for precision engineering and wealthier residents could even afford to buy themselves a famous Nuremberg Egg pocket watch. This golden era also brought us the two magnificent town halls as well as the Albrecht Dürer House where the artist spent many years of his life. In stark contrast other sites in Nuremberg serve as reminders of the darker years in the citys long history. They include the documentation centre at the former Nazi Party Rally Grounds the eerie site where the National Socialists staged their vast marching processions. Theres also Court Room 600 at the Palace of Justice where the chief perpetrators of the Nazi atrocities were tried and convicted in 1946 – home to Memorium Nuremberg Trials since 2010. Necessary reminders of painful scars in Nurembergs history which will forever be part of the city. Turning to happier thoughts December sees the arrival of Nurembergs Christkindlesmarkt a tradition reaching back more than 400 years. During the festive market the old town bathes in the glow of thousands of twinkling lights putting smiles on the faces of children and adults alike. Alternatively theres the toy museum with exhibits dating back to the early modern period. In the railway museum home to the Adler – Germanys first locomotive – you can gain an insight into the early days of modern transport. The Germanic National Museum meanwhile delves even further back in time. Germanys largest museum of cultural history it contains 1.3 million exhibits that document changing times from the earliest days of civilisation through the Middle Ages the baroque Renaissance and enlightenment periods and into the 19th century. The Handwerkerhof craft courtyard directly opposite the neo-baroque central train station also offers a glimpse into the past. Travellers used to enter the city through its gates and today it houses a colourful array of ancient and modern crafts. Its a place to watch artisans at work pick up souvenirs such as tin toys or leather wallets and of course taste Nurembergs famous spiced gingerbread. The locals also show their love of tradition by enjoying the citys staple snack the Nuremberg rostbratwurst. Records indicate that the city has been serving up these delicious little sausages since the first half of the 14th century. Since that time traditional bratwurst kitchens have continued to prepare these specialities according to the original recipe. One such kitchen is the Bratwurstglöcklein at the Handwerkerhof visited by merchants and travellers from around the world as well as locals craftspeople artists and Nuremberg scholars including Peter Henlein Hans Beheim Albrecht Dürer and Hans Sachs. That many people cant be wrong – why not follow in their culinary footsteps? So if you like to see history brought to life – perhaps accompanied by a freshly poured draught beer in one of the old town bars – then Nuremberg is the place for you. read more » « less Highlights Steam engine to InterCityExpress the Deutsche Bahn Museum » Renaissance style the Albrecht Dürer House » 500 years of childhood dreams the city of toys » Documentation centre at the Nazi Party Rally Grounds » Kaiserburg Castle Nuremberg » Nuremberg Old Town » Germanic National Museum » Nuremberg Trials Memorial » Toy Museum » Related topics Museums Traditions and customs Discover more in the local region Bamberg Old Town » Nuremberg Zoo – a year-round attraction for all the family » Medieval Crime Museum Rothenburg » The Old and New Hermitage Palace – a romantic stroll through history in Bayreuth. » Highlights close Steam engine to InterCityExpress the Deutsche Bahn Museum Founded in 1899 the Deutsche Bahn Museum in Nuremberg is Germanys oldest railway museum.

Find out more about Museums 500 years of childhood dreams the city of toys As far back as the Middle Ages childrens toys were sold at the Christmas market in Nuremberg and the city was home to many doll-makers. However it was from the 16th century onwards that it became a real hotbed for toy manufacturing with numerous craftsmen producing miniature objects and toys. Examples of the magnificent dolls houses made here can still be seen today at the toy museum and in the Germanic National Museum. Nuremberg first came to international prominence in the 19th century following the industrialisation of its toy production and the city has hosted the worlds leading international toy fair every year since 1950.

This aspect of the citys history is also documented at the Memorium Nuremberg Trials museum in Court Room 600 at the Palace of Justice where the trials of the Nazi war criminals were held in 1946. Find out more about Museums Kaiserburg Castle Nuremberg Nuremberg Castle where every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire lived at least for a time between 1050 and 1571 is one of the most important medieval imperial palaces. Friedrich Barbarossa and his successors added large extensions to the Salian royal castle which had been in existence since around the mid 11th century. The double chapel which has survived intact to this day dates back to this time. The imperial apartments and state rooms in the main building whose original panelling has largely been preserved contain 16th and 17th century paintings tapestries and furniture. Nuremberg Old Town Cultural riches and beautiful medieval architecture are the defining features of Nuremberg. The lovingly restored old town with its picturesque lanes and historic buildings is ideal for a leisurely stroll and there are numerous cafés in which to relax and unwind. Between 1471 and 1528 Nuremberg was home to the famous artist Albrecht Dürer. The Dürer House is the only artists residence of the Renaissance in northern Europe to be preserved largely in its original form. In the media station the life and legacy of the artist is explored in digital format using 43 selected works. Historically significant copies of his most important paintings can be seen in the recently opened Dürersaal.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria The paradise for extreme sportsmen The paradise for extreme sportsmen The paradise for extreme sportsmen and nature lovers The whole-year round skiing slopes of Dachstein along with skiing boarding cross country and round skiing also offers the great starting point from where you can reach many of the tallest peaks. The amazing cable cart rises above the might south wall of Dachstein over 1000 meters. In a few minutes it takes you to the ski slope open all year round at the glacier on the elevation of 2700 meters. On a clear day the view from the glacier is simply unbelievable. But you don’t need to take the cable cart to reach the glacier. You can walk the well-marked mountain paths the ferata or some of the climbing options. And to reach the cable cart at Türlwandhütte 1700m you can take a mountain road from Schladming some 18 kilometres away. So you can get there by car it’s a popular spot for bikers and you can reach it also by bus. The bus from the valley runs there few times a day regardless which season it is. The three land’s mountain The area of Dachstein covers approximately 20 times 30 kilometres and features 10 peaks taller than 2500 meters. The glacier is the biggest in the Northern Alps. The limestone structure also features many caves among the better known are Mammuthhöhle and Hirlatzhöhle. Both are among the biggest in Austria. The area of Dachstein was along with Salzkammergut placed on the UNESCO natural heritage list in 1997. Dachstein is also famous for many fossil finds which are still being explored today. The tallest peak Hoher Dachstein 2995 m was first conquered in 1832 and is the tallest peak of Styria. Today there are so many mountaineers visiting it they cause a regular traffic jam on the walking paths. The peak is a very popular destination with many great paths leading up to is making it easy to reach. They also call it the mountain of three lands as it is on the border of three Austrian lands – Salzburg Upper Austria and Styria. A very special and especially popular among climbers is the south wall which measures 1000 meters. Dachstein is also a popular spot for painters and photographers. Unfortunately the glacier is facing a natural catastrophe since it has shrunk for 20 meters since 2003 and it is predicted to be gone about 80 years in the future. Many ways to explore the glacier and mountains The cable cart from the mountain station Hunerkogel with a modern self-service panoramic restaurant is among the most beautiful overview points in the Eastern Alps. The glacier features around 15 kilometres of skiing slopes and three ski lifts and a two seated cable. There are also 15 kilometres of cross country tracks where many athletes go to for summer training when you can’t exercise the sport in the valley. And there are several options for tour skiing on many levels – from extremely difficult to fairly easy ones. Experienced guides lead these tour skiers. Well maintained and marked are also hiking paths and climbing rocks. And you can always hire a guide for any of them. The ice palace One of the main attractions for tourists who do not undertake extreme sporting experience but come to visit the beautiful nature and view is the visit of the ice palace. Inside the glacier they’ve carved halls sculptures and only equipped it with lights – everything else is ice. It really is spectacular walking along the ice statutes inside ice halls. On the walls you can also learn about the ice itself as you see different layers of it from naturally bright and almost clear ice to very dark ice. There are also five sculptures who constantly tend to the ice creations by the help of irons and cutting tools. The Dachstein with its high class tourist offer is a great place for sportsmen and nature lovers of all ages offering both activities and relaxation at the same time. You can reach the glacier and many peaks all year around and spend time in a idyllic mountain world where all nature lovers will find something spectacular to feed their soul.

Saint John was tortured for a long time and his body then hurled from Charles Bridge in Prague into the River Vltava. The legend tells that five stars appeared above his head at that moment. Since that time stars and the number five have been regarded as symbols of this saint. Discover the Santini code This legend was used ingeniously by the architect Santini who designed the whole church on the floor plan of a five-pointed star. The symbol of the stars and number five appear in the building countless times. In the area around the arcade are five gates and five chapels in the church are five altars and on the high altar are five central stars. The whole complex is literally interwoven with mystical symbols and enigmas. Experts are to this very day still looking for the entrance to a secret corridor which allegedly led from the church to the monastery in the nearby Žďár Estate. Visit the New Generation Museum When visiting Zelená hora make sure to stop by at the former Cistercian monastery from the 13th century today a chateau bearing Santini’s legacy which includes the New Generation Museum a modern exposition combining experience elements with exhibits from prominent Czech institutions. This multimedia experience exposition is dedicated to the legacy of Cistercian monks and the boom days of the Baroque period.

Everything about travel Travelogues Austria The tallest peak of Austria and its tour skiing The tallest peak of Austria and its tour skiing »Tour skiing is one of the nicest activities we can undertake in the mountain world« or at least that how this sport should be described. Slovenia but even more its two neighbouring countries Austria and Italy offer many great opportunities for tour skiing. It’s an even more popular sport and a reason why all three countries try to promote it. You can get the equipment for a reasonable price there are guide books and you can also hire guides. Every year there are more and more fans of the sport and consequentially there are also more and more accidents. To avoid those there are many courses in fields of avalanche rescue and other protection. One of the very popular peaks for tour skiing is the Austrian Grossglockner. I’m sure that part of its appeal is also the fact it’s the highest Austrian peak but also offers excellent tour skiing. Tour skiing The history of the sport is long from the times when people started using first tools to walk on snow. Back in those days it meant survival today it’s an adrenalin sport full of pleasure physical activity and fun. It’s becoming ever more popular and thus there are ever more people coming to snowy mountains to enjoy the long descents down the unspoiled and non-existing slopes. A lot of charm is in testing and increasing one’s skills and insurance. I also like the prise which – except for the initial purchase of equipment – isn’t high. As in many sports people again try to do more that they can thus they are risking their and other people’s lives. Good and reliable equipment is necessary if you want to enjoy the snow but you also need to know how to use the equipment and what to do when a mountain presents a danger. But you have to know what you’re capable off and how much experience you’ve got. Equipment Tour skiing is a combination of mountaineering and skiing in one. Hence we need two types of equipment – for climbing and skiing. Additional gear depends on the difficulty of the mountain we’re going to conquer. To get everything you will have to reach deep in the pockets – skiing shoes skies and binds for tour skiing… Skis are usually a bit shorter and wider than those we’d use in established ski slopes. They should not be taller than the person using them. Today you can get flat skis and those with enhanced outside arch – which are not so good as they are harder to handle on ice. The binds for tour skiing are vital – they have to be able to allow the heels to lift off skis so you can walk – important for going uphill. The shoes themselves combine the characteristics of hiking shoes and skiing boots. You have to be able to walk in them but still be high enough to support the ankle but still allowing the flexibility of the ankle so you can walk. This should be blocked upon skiing downhill. Another part is really important to allow you to walk uphill. It’s the skin” or dogs” which are long synthetic strips that you paste to the skies with special glue. On the outside they’ve got fringes or hare on the outside so the skis don’t slip. Sometimes you must even use crusts which are made of metal and you place them on skis like crampons. They are U shaped and you place them under shoes to allow for walking on the icy areas. I also suggest you take some other stuff like the snow probe and shovel which have saved many lives. To Grossglockner on tour skis The mountain visited in every season is not the easiest to conquer so you do need to be in shape! With its 3798m you get to feel the altitude which effects your climb as well. I reached the top with my friends in winter and with my tour skies. There are many ways to the top but most people chose the ones passing either Lucknerhütte or Stüdlhütte. You need to cross the famous glacier Ködnitzkees but I never felt I was on ice as there was a lot of snow all around us that covered both the rocks and ice as well as peaks around us. After the glacier you need to make the steep climb towards the last lodge Erzherzog-Johann-Hütte which is closed in winter time. Not far from the lodge is a place where you must leave your skies and continue with climbing gear along with the pickaxe. The way to the top is steep and exposed between the pass from Small and Big Glockner. There’s a narrow path between them with deep falls on both side so you need to be careful. There are many iron spikes along the way for safety. In the winter the peak has fewer visitors as in summer. The climb is difficult. There are so many visitors in the summer you might have to wait for quite a while to cross the last 250 meters. On the very top there’s a cross and an unparalleled view that makes up for all the hardship trying to reach the highest mountain in Austria. Grossglockner is great for adrenalin sports The charm of this excellent peal are experienced by adrenalin lovers for over 210 years. That is why Grossglockner is the place where alpinism began«. The people who know it believe that Grossglockner with the whole region offers 4 skiing resorts but is more suited for adrenalin than for standard skiing. Climbing and tours skiing would be considered as part of adrenalin sports. Reaching the top itself in the winter time is extreme. Not only is this the tallest peak of Austria it is also one of the tallest peaks in the Alps itself. The area around it is also the oldest national park in Austria named Hohe Tauern. It’s a protected area since 1981. And unfortunately such peaks always demand their toll. There are over 300 known fatal accidents since the first climb in 1800. All 300 are collected in a book at the village of Heiligenblut the village on the other side also features many accidents which makes it even more dangerous. Although every adrenalin lover knows what the risks are there’s a great desire to reach such peaks thus nobody considers failure an option. Grossglockner is a very important destination that many people – even if they’ll never reach the top – want to see it. There is even the tallest panoramic road in the Alps as the popular destination with bikers and cyclists riding it. If you want to spend a few more days in the Alps I suggest you to book yourself in the Hostel Heiligenblut.

Visit the National Stud Farm in Kladruby nad Labem in East Bohemia. You will see the facilities of one of the oldest still operating stud farms in Europe. Here they breed the oldest variety of Czech coach horses – the Kladruber. Over the centuries of horse breeding and training even the countryside around the stud farm has been perfectly adjusted to this purpose. Together the stud farm and this unique countryside were registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List as of 2019.

The Kladruby Stud Farm is also one of the oldest stud farms in the world. In 1579 Emperor Rudolf II promoted the farm to an stud farm for the imperial court and it has been the home of the Kladruber horses ever since. Kladruber horses are currently bred both in Kladruby which is particularly well known for its white variety and in Slatiňany known for its black variety. The main horse herd is housed in Kladruby nad Labem – there are about 500 pedigree studs mares and foals. What Is the Kladruber Like? The white Kladruber was originally used for ceremonial purposes in royal and imperial courts around Europe and the black Kladruber for the coaches of church dignitaries. Today the white Kladruber is still used for its original purpose by the Swedish and Danish royal courts. At present the Kladrubers represent the farm in draft horse show competitions but you can also see them in standard dressage demonstrations by the High School of Spanish Riding and as part of mounted police forces. Kladrubers are also used in hippotherapy and leisure riding thanks to their calm nature. Tour of the Stud Farm and Chateau The premises have been maintained in their original classicist style and you can take part in several tours including guided tours of the stables the coach garage with an exhibition on the Kladruber and the chateau. You can also see a Baroque timbered cottage – the forester’s lodge – or climb up the lookout tower and take in its view of the surrounding countryside. If you want to travel back in time to the era of Franz Joseph I of Austria and his wife Elisabeth of Bavaria start with a tour of the stable at the chateau. Walk in the footsteps of the imperial couple through 12 stylishly furnished halls and chambers look in the church that they had built and listen to the stories about their peculiar habits and remarkable fates. In the coach garage there is a coach that belonged to Ferdinand I of Austria the state coach of the first Czechoslovak President Tomáš G. Masaryk and other valuable coaches and sleighs. The model of the imperial eight-horse hitch that you can see there will amaze you. In the museum you can explore the history Kladruber breeding which spans more than five centuries. In addition the Stud Farm organises several events for the general public every year and at each you can see the Kladruber horses in action. These include the Rudolf Cup – an international riding competition that takes place in April Kladruber Horse Day in May Kladruby naruby – an entertaining family afternoon in September and the Hubert Ride in October.

Wuppertal is the biggest city in the Bergisches Land and is the regions main centre for business education industry and the arts. It is above all known as the city with the suspended monorail – as Wuppertals official slogan proudly proclaims. From the windows of the monorail visitors look out onto a confident historically aware city with an amazing amount to offer. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner The name Wuppertal is actually a relatively modern designation that first appeared on maps only 80 years ago. But its various constituent towns had been there long before that and in 1929 Elberfeld Barmen Ronsdorf Cronenberg and Vohwinkel were merged to form Barmen-Elberfeld. In 1930 the name was changed to Wuppertal after a referendum – a fitting choice that describes the citys location in the Wupper valley. Wuppertals most famous landmark the unique suspended monorail follows the course of the river for a few miles through the city centre. Every day over 80000 passengers use it as a reliable means of transport and a sure-fire way of beating the traffic jams. The monorail opened in 1901. Since 1997 its supporting structures have been undergoing a programme of renewal in keeping with the original design. The stations are also being modernised. Like the suspended monorail the citys dance company Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch has also established a global reputation. The acclaimed choreographer Pina Bausch was the ensembles artistic director for 36 years. She reinvented and redefined dance during her tenure combining drama modern dance and musical theatre to create a new form of expression. Performances take place at its current home the opera house in Wuppertal although tickets need to be booked well in advance as the ensemble is often on tour. But an evening of culture can also be enjoyed in the historical Stadthalle Wuppertal one of the loveliest concert and conference venues in Europe. While there is no doubt that the Stadthalle built in Wilhelminian style is magnificent it is also surrounded by a number of other striking edifices. Despite being bombed in the Second World War Wuppertal has around 4500 architectural monuments – the second highest concentration of historical buildings in North Rhine-Westphalia. Architecture of the 19th century is particularly well represented with a whole host of remarkable buildings. The Briller Viertel for example is one of the largest and most architecturally consistent of Germanys exclusive mansion suburbs. Also of interest are the trade exhibition buildings from Germanys industrial heyday found near the centre of the Elberfeld district. Elberfeld is also home to Wuppertals most significant art gallery the Von der Heydt Museum which presents an impressive collection of paintings sculptures prints and photographs from the 17th century to the present day. The exhibitions focus on French 19th-century painting and Modernism including works by major artists such as Paula Modersohn-Becker Max Slevogt Lovis Corinth Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Erich Heckel Karl Schmidt-Rottluff Wassily Kandinsky Otto Mueller Emil Nolde Franz Marc August Macke Alexej von Jawlensky and Max Beckmann. Since opening in the 1950s the clock museum in Elberfeld has built up one of the most comprehensive collections related to the history of timekeeping – and is even interesting for visitors who have all the time in the world. Some people would certainly wish this was the case so that they can devote some time to Wuppertals extensive shopping areas where malls arcades and boutiques have something to suit all tastes. You can discover the delights of the local cuisine either in sophisticated restaurants or just as easily in the quaint welcoming pubs on almost every street corner. Those in search of a good night out wont be disappointed by Wuppertals many clubs and bars. There are also plenty of places to relax and recover from the night before. About half of the citys area is given over to farmland gardens woodland and parks – including one of the most beautiful zoos in Germany and Tony Craggs sculpture park where you can admire contemporary works of art as you stroll around. read more » « less Highlights Upside-down transport the suspended monorail » Revolutionary movements Tanztheater Pina Bausch » Wilhelminian exterior high-tech interior the historical Stadthalle » Art in Elberfeld the Von der Heydt Museum » Discover more in the local region Bottrop Indoor Skydiving Centre experience the dream of flight » Neanderthal Museum Mettmann » Castles of Augustusburg and Falkenlust in Brühl » Movie Park Germany action and adventure on the big screen » Highlights close Upside-down transport the suspended monorail The steel millipede is more than 100 years old yet its technology still impresses today. Wuppertals unique suspended monorail is known well beyond the confines of the city. Built in around 1900 it still provides a safe and reliable way of getting around. The Schwebebahn covers a 13.3km route through the city suspended twelve metres off the ground. As a public transport system its cult status is virtually unrivalled. Over the course of its history more than 1.5 billion people have travelled on the monorail and experienced what it feels like to hover over the Wupper valley. The train takes 35 minutes to complete its journey and passengers can get on or off at any one of 20 stops along the way. Find out more about City-Highlights Revolutionary movements Tanztheater Pina Bausch This internationally acclaimed and award-winning dance theatre was founded by the highly respected choreographer Pina Bausch in 1973 and she was its director until her death in 2009. Daring to revolutionise the world of dance with a new interpretation of movement and an aesthetic artistic and cultural paradigm shift Pina Bausch led the theatre from new beginnings to extraordinary heights. Her theatre does not focus on characteristic dance movements but on people and their place within society.

The enticing names of Marco Polo Hugo Boss Strellson and Calvin Klein are in good company alongside Armani Bulgari Gucci Jil Sander Prada Tiffany & Co. and Versace forming a stronghold of refined taste. Königsallee is one of only a handful of internationally regarded streets that can justifiably call themselves a boulevard.

Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner How do you like the sound of a port sightseeing tour followed by a stroll through the old town before heading to HafenCity Hamburgs new city centre? Or perhaps the other way around… ? There are countless ways to discover the beguiling character of this Hanseatic trade centre that is at once steeped in tradition and at the forefront of modernity. That said no visit to Hamburg would be complete without a boat trip around one of Europes biggest ports. Sightseeing boats launch from the Landungsbrücken jetties and weave their way through huge container vessels majestic steam-powered ocean liners and elegant yachts an experience that can only be described as unforgettable. Make your visit all the more memorable with a leisurely stroll through the old town where noble merchants once traded coffee tea and spices. Today its an inviting scene of residences and grand corner buildings from the 17th to the 19th century quaint restaurants and laid-back bars. Another reminder of Hamburgs heritage is the historical Speicherstadt home to the worlds largest single complex of traditional brick warehouses resting on thousands of oak supports and intersected by narrow waterways the Fleets. Or if you want to discover the Hamburg of today and tomorrow head to HafenCity one of the largest inner-city construction projects in Europe and a contrast between seafaring heritage and cutting-edge architecture in the heart of the Überseequartier. Nestled between Speicherstadt and the port this maritime world of discovery and shopping paradise stretches all the way to the Hamburg Cruise Center along a broad boulevard. If this place doesnt give you a taste for cruises then nothing ever will. After seeing some of the worlds biggest and most spectacular cruise ships sailing in and out of Hamburgs port youre sure to leave with aspirations of sailing the seven seas.

Each has stacked-stone or wooden foundations and reconstructed rough-plank construction. Its enchanting no doubt about it but can be exhausting if you hit a cruise-ship and bus-tour crush. Tickets & tours Bergen Card £21.88 and up Details Basic Bergen - 1h £8.21 and up Details Bergen Segway Tours £63.37 and up Details More tickets & tours The current 58 buildings 25% of the original although some claim there are now 61 cover 13000 sq metres and date from after a great fire in 1702 although the building pattern is from the 12th century. The archaeological excavations suggest that the quay was once 140m further inland than its present location. In the early 14th century there were about 30 wooden buildings each usually shared by several stuer trading firms. They rose two or three stories above the wharf and combined business premises with living quarters and warehouses. Each building had a crane for loading and unloading ships as well as a schøtstue large assembly room where employees met and ate. Do explore further than the frontages facing the harbour as the wooden alleyways inside Bryggen are the most charming a haven for artists and craftspeople there are bijou boutiques at every turn. The atmosphere of an intimate waterfront community remains intact and losing yourself in Bryggen is one of Bergens greatest pleasures.

They are located in some of the country’s most dynamic and handsome cities and provide a perfect way to take a trip through their local history tradition and culture. Oxbridge splendour No prizes for guessing that Oxford and Cambridge vie for top billing. Both are stunningly beautiful collegiate universities whose origins can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Oxford is the larger of the two and has more of a city feel with its own identity outside the university. That said there is no doubt that the university - the oldest in the English-speaking world - and its 38 colleges predominate in the city of ‘dreaming spires’ as described by the Victorian poet Matthew Arnold. Places of interest in the city are myriad but some of the highlights include the Sheldonian Theatre Sir Christopher Wren’s first major building the Bodleian Library the Radcliffe Camera and the Ashmolean one of Britain’s most renowned museums. Balliol University and Merton are the oldest colleges but Christ Church founded by Cardinal Wolsey in 1524 is arguably the grandest and can count 13 prime ministers among its alumni. Most colleges are open to the public. This year Oxford is celebrating the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death with a wide-ranging cultural programme of exhibitions and performances. Cambridge is a more tranquil city. The university is smaller with around 18000 students to Oxford’s 26000 but with its exquisite colleges and beautiful environment it is every inch Oxford’s rival. From the ‘Backs’ the grounds of the colleges such as St John’s Queens’ and Magdalene that abut the River Cam to the neoclassical Fitzwilliam Museum replete with treasures from antiquity and works by Leonardo Titian and other Renaissance artists to the Gothic masterpiece that is King’s College Chapel Cambridge is unquestionably first class. The ‘Fitz’ is celebrating its bicentenary this year and is staging a number of events throughout the year. The red bricks In contrast to Oxford and Cambridge are the northern ‘red brick’ university cities of Liverpool and Manchester which provide a seductive mixture of grit glamour and grandeur. Their universities founded in the last year of the Victorian era originally concentrated on practical skills such as engineering as opposed to the liberal arts and divinity of Oxbridge. This no-nonsense remit is emblematic of both cities which lie only 50 km apart in Lancashire. Manchester is if nothing else what one might term ‘brassy’. Mancunians are not backward in coming forward in telling you about their city’s qualities which are manifest. Home to the Halle Orchestra the Royal Exchange Theatre a significant China Town and gay village Coronation Street Salford Quays which includes The Lowry gallery and the Imperial War Museum North. Let’s not forget the John Rylands Library decades of musical talent – such as Factory Records New Order and Oasis - and oh yes two famous soccer teams – City and United. Manchester’s great civic and sporting rival Liverpool is no longer the down-at-heel city of the 1970s and 80s it boasts some of the best museums and galleries outside London including the Walker Art Gallery and the Tate Liverpool. A certain pop group called The Beatles hailed from the city and a must-see is The Beatles Story a museum telling the Fab Four’s story as well as tours of the Cavern Club where John Paul George and Ringo first played. There is architectural grandeur in the form of the ‘Three Graces’ – the Port of Liverpool Royal Liver and Cunard buildings. If you like your soccer like Manchester there are two equally storied teams Liverpool and Everton. All this served with a helping of the renowned Liverpudlian or ‘scouse’ wit. The university’s Victoria Building designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a Gothic Revival style and opened in 1892 and now the Victoria Gallery and Museum can lay claim to being the inspiration of the term ‘red brick’. Ancient and modern In England’s storied north-east is Durham one of the country’s oldest universities in one of its most stunning settings. The cobbled streets of this distinguished university city are dominated by the magnificent Norman cathedral constructed over 40 years to 1133. Built in a Romanesque style it is one of the country’s great buildings. The part of the Palatinate on which it stands includes Palace Green the Castle which is also a university college the Bailey and various historic bridges and is a World Heritage Site. Cross the border into Scotland for much of interest and one or two surprises. Did you know that Aberdeen as well as being the centre of the UKs oil industry is home to its fifth oldest university founded in 1495? Nestled near the post-Reformation splendour and cloisters of King’s College is the Sir Duncan Rice Library a significant piece of modern architecture designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen and winner of a 2013 Royal Institute of British Architects prize. Dundee nestled on the River Tay is one of Britain’s best-kept secrets and famous for the three Js jute jam and journalism. Winston Churchill was the city’s MP between 1908 and 1922. The jute production long since gone provided sailing cloth for whaling ships that sailed from the port in the 19th century. It was also where the Discovery the ship that carried Captain Scott and Ernest Shackleton on their maiden voyage to the Antarctic was built and launched in 1901. It is now a major attraction at Discovery Point along with the Verdant Works jute museum. They will be joined in 2017 by the V&A Museum of Design Dundee a sister to the London V&A this major new building on the waterfront has been designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Kuma and will add to the city’s list of cutting-edge architecture. Dundee University frequently lauded as Scotland’s best and a world leader in biosciences has a campus that has been designed in part by Sir Terry Farrell. It is also the home of legendary comics Beano and Dandy the latter sadly no longer though there is a statue of Desperate Dan its best known character in the city centre. Cross the Tay for a 10-mile hop to St. Andrews a handsome seaside town that houses the University of St Andrews. Founded in the early 15th century and the third oldest in the English speaking world after Oxford and Cambridge it is one of Britain’s academic powerhouses. The town is home to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club which frequently stages the British Open. The heir to the throne the Duke of Cambridge attended the university and met his future wife Kate Middleton there. Film buffs may recall the unforgettable opening scene of Chariots of Fire running along the seashore to the strains of Vangelis. That was the local West Sands beach. Let’s not forget the ‘Athens of the North’ Edinburgh. Find any reason you can to visit the capital city of Scotland it has some of the grandest handsomest buildings you will find in Britain including the Queen’s residence the Palace of Holyroodhouse opposite the newer Scottish Parliament designed by Enric Miralles the Spanish architect and opened in 2004. Edinburgh or ‘Auld Reekie’ to some of its inhabitants has dramatic vistas everywhere you look from Arthur’s Seat to the Castle to the grand New Town which tumbles down to the Firth of Forth. Every August it stages the biggest and most renowned arts and fringe festival in the world. The university is mainly situated in the Old Town it has a distinguished history in medicine and perhaps not surprisingly as the city of the infamous murderers Burke and Hare has an Anatomical Museum. If you are not too squeamish this is open to the public on the last Saturday of every month. A touch of Rome If cities were supermodels Bath would be up there on the catwalk. In England’s south-west it’s a beautiful city of under 90000 souls and a World Heritage Site. It was occupied by the Romans in the first century AD and was formerly known as Aquae Sulis. The baths are thought to be one of the best preserved Roman remains in the world. The ancient world sits alongside the Georgian delights of the Circus and Royal Crescent. This vibrant small city is also home to two universities Bath and Bath Spa. The former is from the generation of British universities founded in the early 1960s known as ‘Plate Glass’ universities. Bath Spa can trace its origins to Bath School of Art and the 1850s and the grounds of its Newtown Park campus were designed by Capability Brown. Travel Tip Getting round Britain by rail is simple and convenient and the best-value way to do it is to buy a BritRail pass which has many different options depending on how much of the country you want to see. This pass is only available to overseas visitors so you need to get one in advance.

But nothing is as challenging as being trapped in another country...literally. I was planning to fly home for a week at the end of March. I was so convinced I would be there that I extended by a week so I could run the 6X Dunkin Donut Half Marathon which was finally scheduled for the beginning of April after being talked about for a number of years. As the month of March rolled on I was still convinced I was going. Jen didnt want me to go...she even canceled her own trip but I was insistent. It took a text from my sister and mother saying they would prefer if I didnt come. So I gave in and canceled my trip. Seeing what was going on in the US its wasnt a bad idea to stay put. I was still in Dubai...able to run and walk the dog. Running was banned at first but then I received clarification from the Dubai Police that gave me permission to run solo...life was good. That was until Dubai went on a 24 hour lockdown. No one can go outside unless receiving permission to do so. If Social Distancing on a delivery you were given permission you had to wear a mask. However no running and no walking the dog which is totally insane if you live in an apartment. There is a website where you enter your request with options of Grocery/Pharmacy Medical or Emergency. The first day I entered a request to walk the dog and it was granted...Yes!! Well apparently that was an error and the next day my request was denied. No walking the dog or there is a possibility of being fined AED2000-3000 US$544-$816. I didnt have a choice but to walk the dog and roll the dice. Keeping enough alcohol in the house for Jennifer to stay sane not that she drinks that much but certain times call for certain measures is also a bit of a challenge. When things were normal we would drive to another emirates up north where there is a large liquor store that has anything you could imagine and bring it back to Dubai. Now that we cant do that we need to buy liquor here. In Dubai you need a liquor license to buy alcohol. They have made it easier by allowing you to apply online for the license...as Virtual coffee with fellow runners well I dont need to give Jennifer permission to buy alcohol at the moment so she can easily apply. And of course in Dubai you can have the alcohol delivered...so we still have options...you just need to plan ahead as there can be a wait to get your order. Runs have pretty much come to a halt. The running group I joined now has a virtual coffee meet up on Fridays after what used to be our long run. Before the lockdown I tried to get a treadmill delivered but the building was only allowing deliveries that were an emergency...HELLO! ... this is an emergency. I then changed my requested and asked to have medical equipment required for rehabilitation delivered and was given approval. But now there is a total lockdown and I cant get it delivered so I lose again. At some point I need to get the running shoes back on since I am supposed to be running the London Marathon which was moved from April to October. Now that sounds like it will be in jeopardy to be canceled. Keeping my fingers crossed. I was able to get a flight voucher from my canceled flight. Empty streets of Dubai The plan at the moment is the fly to the US in July and stay through mid September so I can train for London. There is no way I can do it in the heat of Dubai and I refused to marathon train on a treadmill for the sake of my sanity so it will be 8 weeks of the Howard County Striders Next Step Half/Full program. Everything is on hold at the moment however at least until the planes are flying again as there are basically no flights in or out of Dubai at the moment. So for the time being we are stuck indoors but able to get fresh air by going onto the balcony. Word is that I can walk the dog now but it has to be close to the building and can be for only 10 minutes I dont know who times that. At least that takes away some of the stress of getting fined. And we continue to try to make the best out of challenging conditions. « Previous Entry Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message Larry Stern LarryandJen The timing seemed right and the offer couldnt be turned down so my wife and I made a 5 year commitment to move to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 5shares As soon as we started looking at moving to Victoria from Toronto we knew we were going to have to put together an epic bucket list for our time on Vancouver Island. As nature and outdoor lovers the lure of VI is strong and we know we’re going to have plenty of things to do on Vancouver Island to keep us busy! Here are a few of the experiences we’ve set our sights on! This site uses compensated affiliate links Find out more in our Disclosure. Thanks for your support! Our Vancouver Island bucket list What might look like a small slither on the map compared to the rest of Canada is anything but. Often overlooked in favour of its namesake city on the mainland and the rest of British Colombia Vancouver Island has plenty to offer – especially for the outdoor lover – and could keep you busy exploring for weeks months or even years. Vancouver Island is 460 kilometres 290 mi in length 100 kilometres 62 mi in width at its widest point and 32134 km2 12407 sq mi in area. It takes five hours to drive from Victoria to Tofino alone and is in fact the largest island on the western coast of the Americas. Home to mountains lakes temperate rainforest and sandy beaches the topography of Vancouver Island is varied too. Being based in Victoria on the southern tip of the Island we can’t wait to head north and experience the beauties this huge island has to offer. Here’s what’s on our bucket list for our time here on Vancouver Island! Pin this for later on Pinterest 1. Wander the English Gardens of Victoria Once the capital of the British Dominion of Canada it’s not surprising the Victoria has retained something of its former imperial legacy. Victoria is known as the City of Gardens” – its temperate climate compared to the rest of Canada makes it the perfect place to grow. Being fond of English Gardens not to mention getting a welcome reminder of home we’re looking forward to getting to know our new home city and enjoying moments of tranquility in spring and summer surrounded by blooms. The famous Butchart Gardens are some of the most popular and include not only rose gardens and plenty of fountains but gardens inspired by Japan and around the world. 2. Head out to Watch the Whales Mention Vancouver Island and whales probably jump to mind. The island offers some incredible opportunities for whale watching with possible sightings depending on the season including Orcas Grey Whales Minke Whales and in the north Dolphins Porpoises and Humpback Whales. Conservationist Jacques Cousteau declared Telegraph Cove in the North of Vancouver Island as one of the best places in the world to observe Orca Whales in the wild. Just last month a new Orca calf was spotted with a southern Orca pod by a whale watching trip from Victoria. We can’t wait to research the best whale watching tours from Vancouver Island and report back! 3. Practise our Surfing in Tofino The hippy laid back surf and beach town of Tofino – with its dramatic coastline and famous waves – is Vancouver Island’s and Canada’s top spot for surfing and is home to a wide range of surf schools and camps. Come July and August Tofino is a popular spot for beach-lovers yogis and surfers alike and is full of fair-trade ethical boutiques and vegan cafes packed in alongside the surf outfits. Just make sure to bring your wetsuit as the water is far from warm! It’s been a long time since we’ve taken to the waves so we’re looking forward to dipping our toes into Canadian waters. 4. Learn about First Nations Culture We love to learn about indigenous and local culture when we travel and Vancouver Island is incredibly rich in its own Indigenous culture from the First Nations groups who have long called Vancouver Island home. The First Nations were the first inhabitants of the island and there are 53 First Nations Communities on Vancouver Island which were all established with their own chief. The First Nations are spread across three distinct tribal districts The Coast Salish Nuu chah nulth & Kwakiutl. After centuries of facing persecution and suffering the First Nations have regained recognition and rights – at least to some extent- in recent years although indigenous populations across Canada are still having to fight for many of their land and other rights. First Nations culture is being celebrated on Vancouver Island and there are a range of community tourism initiatives set up that visitors can support and learn about First Nations culture at. Learn more from Indigenous BC. Totem pole arch gate in Nanaimo Vancouver Island 5. Get our Hiking Boots on Hiking is one of the best ways to explore Vancouver Island and the trails are endless From relaxing strolls to multi-day treks and mountain ascents. Mount Douglas Park just 20 minutes away from Downtown Victoria will likely be our starting point We hear it has amazing views of the bay and over the city. We’ve got our eye on the Wild Pacific Trail in Ucluelet as well as the longer and more remote Juan de Fuca Marine trail along the Island’s Western Coast. 6. Discover the best of Ecotourism on Vancouver Island We love a good sustainable resort eco lodge or tourism project that does some good and the good news is that there are plenty of them on Vancouver Island! From First Nations Community Tourism projects to Carbon Neutral lodges we’ll be looking to report back on the best of these. On our shortlist The Clayquot Wilderness Resort and Cabana Desolaton! Vancouver Island is home to plenty of wildlife including black bears 7. Bathe in the Forests & Nature It’s official – there’s nothing better for our wellbeing than being surrounded by nature. We hadn’t heard of Forest Bathing until our recent trip to Costa Rica but we can’t wait to experience Vancouver Island’s rainforests and woods first hand. Several companies are now running nature therapy” tours – which may or may not be your thing – it’s just as easy to go for a walk yourself. We’re looking forward to experiencing Vancouver Island’s hot springs woodland walkways hiking trails and even its opportunities to sight bears – a new phenomenon for us!

The tours were really cheap considering it was a full day and most of the night 650 BHT/£13 each. We looked online to see if there was other cheaper more daring ways to get there and it turns out there wasn’t. So we booked our trip in the morning and left in the afternoon with a dozen or so other tourists ranging from Chinese Japanese and Americans. Everyone was fairly young though so I blended in with them all It took about an hour and a half to get to the first destination which was something I had seen a long time ago and always wanted to visit the Maeklong market. For anyone who hasn’t seen this spectacle its a market along the lines of a railway track. Not unusual you may think but 8 times a day the market vendors have to pull back their awnings to let the train pass. So for anyone from the UK who is around my age 26 you will Train Market 2 remember the police coming in to school to give safety talks about trespassing on the railway lines during the summer months or maybe that was just Skelmersdale the only town not to have a railway station. If you can remember forget everything they said when visiting this market. We had a brief safety talk form the guide who said you will hear bell when you hear bell run not walk behind the safety barriers or the train will crush you now you can go look at the market”. Fantastic so we venture off into the market which to be fair is a tourist attraction now during weekends but is still used by locals to source food for their families and businesses. It sold everything from fish to fruit to BELLLLLLLLLLLLLL. Then the pandemonium started and I thought yeah the train is at least 10 minutes away” – how foolish I was. So there we both are with about 400 tourists running and screaming think of a B rated horror movie and you get the idea to find a barrier to hide behind as the huge locomotive comes rolling down the railway line. So I drag Suu-Min behind a barrier of Train Market 3 a local market vendor and get my camera ready. As you can see from the pictures the train gets very very close and I get some amazing shots and survive the day. You couldn’t dream of this happening at King’s Cross in London but here in Thailand health and safety goes straight out of the window every time when it comes to tourism. So after that adrenaline rush we head over to our next destination which was the Amphawa market. – Suu-Min I’m writing this after being banished to the balcony for being distracting”. It’s a lovely view here to my left the bridge over the Shao Phraya River is stunning all lit up and to my right there are rows of curved ornate roofs. I’d highly recommend this place to stay Sivarin Guest House. It’s clean comfortable and friendly only a short walk from Khao San Road but very quiet. Anyway Amphawa floating markets. This market is not far from Maeklong in Samut Songkram province. I gather it’s not as much of a foreign tourist hotspot as the Damnoen Saduak floating market and this one opens in the Train Market 4 late afternoon so by the time we got there things were just getting started. We had two hours to explore so we took a slow pace matching the pace of the market around us. It’s one of the most peaceful places that I’ve been in a long time. Along the banks of the canal there are guesthouses the doors of many of which were open and we could see inside. They looked beautiful all wooden floors and walls with cabinets full of ornaments and loungers to relax on. The guide had said on the way that they were around 200-300 Baht a night £4-6 definitely something I’d love to do. In the mornings the vendors travel up and down the canal and each house has stairs down to the water so that you can buy things – anything from food to flowers. Most of the market is actually based on dry ground on the banks of the canal and a little further back in to the buildings with just a few boats near the waters edge. There were mostly food stalls for fresh vegetables fish and meat as well as some selling I ♥ Amphawa” t-shirts and the like. Train Market 5 We wandered away from the edge of the water and came to the riverside where we were nearly the only people there. Again stunning views something about water as well is so peaceful. On the way back to the main part of the market we passed the market entertainment which was a middle-aged Thai gentleman who alternated between DJ-ing and singing Karaoke. He was awesome though not really in tune. Walking the opposite direction from the market there were beautiful gardens which I wished we’d found sooner as it was nearing the time for us to head back to the starting point. On our way back there was a man and his dog playing in the river. It was really adorable the man would duck under the water to hide from the dog who would pretend not to be able to find him and then the man would burst out from under the water behind him. When we got back to the starting point it was nearly dark and time for the last part of our journey the fireflies. We piled into boats and headed away from the market. It’s an awesome trip about an Train Market 6 hour all up. Our boat was really full and we got passed by all the other boats until the driver revved the engine and we started speeding through the water like a jet boat I’m probably exaggerating…. Once we reached the area with the fireflies we pulled over towards the banks. I was expecting them to be like glowworms always lit up but they seem to flash in unison more like Christmas lights. A few of them flew close to our boats. Our final leg was through the market itself which by then had finished but all the houses were lit up for the evening and there were still a few vendors gently paddling up and down. After that amazing 1 1/2 hour boat ride we ended up in the same place as we started which was really confusing for Scotty who kept asking me how we had managed to do that. That’s the end of our time in Bangkok this time around – tomorrow another early start and where our real journey begins – the infamous border crossing to Cambodia.

Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 392shares What to wear in India on your trip there is a topic that provokes a lot of thought discussion and debate! And so… we’re here to help 😉 With half of this blog being Indian and a Mumbai-ker and the other half me having travelled around India solo on many an occasion we’d like to share a few tips for how to dress in India – and dispel a few myths along the way! This post contains compensated affiliate links. For more info and our full disclosure please read here. What to Wear in India A Complete Guide for Women Travellers and Men!. It’s no secret that India is at least one of our favourite travel destinations on the planet. There’s enough to awe entertain and inspire you here for months if not years – and many a traveller has fallen for India’s charms. India also seems to suffer from something of a reputation problem though – particularly when it comes to the topic of female travel. The question of solo female travel in India is hotly debated and with it a certain emphasis comes on how to carry yourself and how to dress in India. India is a sub-continent populated by over a billion people. Times are changing fast and India is firmly set to become one of our world’s economic powerhouses. Although we may see pictures of poverty tradition and rural India on social media the country is far more than that. Mumbai is reportedly home to the greatest number of billionaires in the world and you’re just as likely to see beautiful girls in hot pants on a saturday night out as women in sarees. ⓘ TIP Planning a trip to India? Join our free India Travel Facebook group here! There is no one answer to the question what to wear in India”. Rather there are as many answers as there are times of day – such are the nuances of this rapidly changing country and culture. But fear not. Just before you get really frustrated with us for refusing to answer your question 😉 we aren’t done just yet. This is a mini-guide to clothing for travel in India what to avoid myths about what to wear in India and sensitivities to be aware of.

Our Indian Uniform” – Ravi in jeans & t-shirt me in Salwar Kameez Dressing for Safe Travel in India We’re guessing what brought you to this post is your desire to a be safe travelling in India and b be culturally appropriate and respectful while travelling in India. Firstly Thank You! The world needs many more sensitive travellers like you. Secondly Despite the warnings and cautionary tales India is an incredibly rewarding place to travel and the vast majority of female and male travellers who venture here do not experience any trouble. If you follow your common sense keep an eye on your surroundings and are aware of how you are perceived then it will increase your safety too! How you dress does have a direct impact on how you may be perceived during your trip to India – especially if you’re venturing off the beaten path. Which is why how to dress in India as a tourist is an often debated topic. Whatever you wear in India if you have a non-Indian skin tone either lighter or darker and different colour hair you will stand out. But wearing revealing clothes on top of that can add some masala to the attention. Which you probably don’t want! Foreign women are sometimes perceived as exotic” and naturally attract increased interest in what is still a male dominated society where women are in short supply – so to mitigate that you want to cover up more than you might at home while staying cool. ⓘ TIP Planning a trip to India? Click here to get our FREE India Travel Checklist! I was happy I had a scarf here – to help shield my head from the 35+ degree heat! Do’s and Don’ts of dressing in India Based on our experiences here are a few Do’s and Don’ts Do look around you Take note of what local women are wearing what areas of the body they are covering and take your queue from them we’re not saying you have to buy a saree but if everyone around you is in shorts you’re probably fine in the same. Do ask if you’re not sure Ask local friends if you have them ask other hotel/hostel guests or ask tour guides for feedback on what you’re wearing if you’re really not sure. If you’re at the beach don’t wear swimwear off the beach even just to cross the road to get your coconut water. Many of India’s beautiful beaches are actually in more conservative communities depending where in the country you are and not dressing properly causes offence. In Goa or at resort beaches bikinis are fine but on local beaches it’s better to swim partially clothed a loose t-shirt over your swimsuit is a good idea. Don’t ever sunbathe topless. Even if you think no-one can see you they probably can. And do you really want your nude top half going viral on WhatsApp? Don’t show lots of leg. You’ll see that locals regardless of where you are very rarely show leg. It’s best to wear long trousers and skirts. An exception is some beach towns Goa and Varkala being the obvious examples where shorts can be fine. Don’t show cleavage or wear strappy tops. In more liberal parts of the country sleeveless shirts or tunics are fine whereas in other places you’ll feel more comfortable in sleeves. Do avoid overly tight figure hugging clothes. Protect that booty by covering it with a long / loose top or loose pants/trousers! Do wear bright colours Not only will they make your feel more cheerful you’ll blend in to India’s rainbow of colour! Dispelling a Few Myths Given that India has been portrayed in a certain light in the media travel advice tends so err on the cautious and a limited view of what it is like to live and travel in India has developed. Let’s be clear on a few things. It’s not always hot in India. Depending on when and where you travel you may need warmer layers too. You don’t need to cover your hair in India unless you’re entering a Sikh or Muslim religious shrine/temple/mosque You don’t need to wear Indian clothing – see more below! Younger Indians are just as likely to be sporting t-shirts and skinny jeans than traditional Indian dress. It all depends on where you are! You don’t have to wear elephant pants. India is loved as a hippy backpacking destination but it is perfectly possible to travel here and look smart too! You can wear jewellery – just maybe leave your diamond collection / family jewels at home. Many Indians wear a lot of jewellery so don’t be afraid to get some local jewellery for yourself too negotiate!. ⓘ TIP Planning a trip to India? Click here to get our FREE India Travel Checklist! Should you Dress Local? For my first solo trip to India I followed the advice that wearing local clothing would earn me more respect and be safer as a solo female traveller. I headed out shopping and got myself a few kurtas tunic style long tops with splits below the waist – they vary in length from just below the bum to below the knee as well as a custom made salwaar kameez. All of this was great fun and very inexpensive but I found myself attracting plenty of attention and comments for my Indian-style attire particularly in the big cities. I found myself wondering Would I just have blended in better if I had been wearing western clothes? The answer is probably yes in some situations. Clearly we’re not advocating wandering around India in a backpack and saree hardly the most comfortable combination. Here are a few guidelines based on our experiences In cities or touristy areas think Goa Mumbai Bangalore Delhi Rishikesh Ladakh etc you’re fine in western clothes or a Kurta and leggings / jeans. In rural areas and villages you’ll need to dress more conservatively and local clothing can help here for women. We suggest wearing Kurta + Leggings or a Punjabi Suit / Salwar Kameez baggy trousers + kurta top. Some parts of India are more conservative than others – e.g. Uttar Pradesh & Rajasthan are more traditional than Maharashtra so local clothing as above for rural India can be helpful. If in doubt Look at what the local women of your age around you are wearing and use that as a barometer. In general Sarees are the preserve of married Indian women and we don’t recommend wearing them out and about on your travels for visitors unless you are invited to wear one to a special occasion or event such as a wedding. Buying one as a souvenir is of course fine! The one time I got to wear a saree in India! What to Wear in India The Essentials Here are our recommended essential items for dressing in India for Women. Go for natural fibres / fabrics whereever you can as these keep you cooler and are more comfortable plus they are better for the environment. Accessories Sunglasses – not only for keeping the sun out but great for avoiding any stares or would be Romeo’s. We love ethical brand Pala Eyewear. A secure handbag / purse. We love crossbody bags as you can keep them in front of you and on your person at all times i’ve always used crossbody bags when travelling in India. A basic leather one is good or for added security you can use a Travelon one which has additional security measures built in! Top Half Scarves Scarves Scarves. Drape them across your chest backwards like a dupatta Indian Style wrap them over your head in the heat or around your shoulders to keep warm in AC. You will find so many uses for your scarf! We recommend 1 x Thin / light Linen Cotton or Hemp Scarf and 1 x Thicker Shawl which you can also use a blanket on AC trains etc Tunic tops / loose shirts or blouses – we love this one and this one T-shirts – preferably made from organic cotton hemp or bamboo such as these ones Kurta tops – you can buy them online if you just can’t wait until you get to India 😉 Warmer Layer such as a fleece or hoodie always take one warmer layer for air conditioned transport and winter in North India High quality organic cotton/bamboo vest tops are useful for wearing under a blouse / kurta if it’s really hot and you don’t want to wear a bra – personally I find they really dig in in the heat. Cotton layers actually help to keep you cool 🙂 Bottom Half Loose fitting harem pants or Linen trousers like these Leggings only wear under a long top that covers your bottom Jeans – skinny or regular we suggest 1 pair is enough Modest shorts for the beach not ones that expose your ‘cheeks! A long loose skirt or Linen trousers like these – skirts are great for bus travel in case you have to go to the bathroom in nature! Make sure your long skirt is not too tight and doesn’t have tall slits in the side. I saw a girl wearing a long skirt with thigh-high slits in at the Taj Mahal – and every man in sight was gaping at her. &ampampampampltbr /&ampampampampgt Swimwear for India A loose fitting kaftan or maxi dress can be handy if you’ll be hitting the beach A bikini or swimsuit is fine for resorts or the touristy beaches of Goa. On local beaches or in the countryside we suggest swimming with a t-shirt & shorts on as locals swim fully clothed. Don’t ever walk around off the beach in your swimwear My typical Mumbai attire T shirt skinny jeans and scarf Footwear We suggest taking a pair of sandals / flip flops for chilling out in we love Reef who contribute to cleaning up beaches around the world. These are also super useful for visiting temples where you need to remove shoes. A pair of covered pumps / canvas shoes such as Toms for travel and walking around cities you don’t want step in something nasty Hiking shoes if you’re going to be trekking breathable ones are recommended and make sure you wear them in beforehand You can buy cheap chuppels” in India pretty decorated sandals so leave plenty of space in your bag! &ampampampampltbr /&ampampampampgt What to Wear for Yoga in India Leave your tight leggings racerbacks and spandex at home! A loose fitting t-shirt Baggy yoga trousers / harem pants Yoga in India is a modest affair and you won’t see the tight yoga clothes that have become a staple of western” yoga. Try to bring tops you can tuck into your trousers to avoid flashing during your downward dogs! Pin me for Later! Knowing What to Wear and When As you’ll see in our should I dress in local clothing” section – we recommend adapting what you wear depending on where you are in India. The easiest way to judge this is to look at what people your age are wearing around you. In general in cities and touristy areas you are fine in western clothing but do stick to the rules of not showing your shoulders chest or legs above the shin. Even in some more touristic areas – notably Agra Varanasi and other parts of central India these regions are more conservative and you will want to cover more than you’d need to on the beaches of Goa. In other specific situations such as going on Tiger or other Wildlife Safaris in India you’ll want to be covered and wearing neutral tones – leave that beautiful bright red top at home. ⓘ TIP Travel Insurance is a must for India – we use and recommend World Nomads – Get your quote here! What to Wear in India for Men Ah guys you have it so easy! Much of the debate around how to dress as a traveller to India is related to women because of the traditional society that exists there. As a man you can wear pretty much what you would at home although a few things to bear in mind Shorts are not popular in India except on the beach. You can wear them but you won’t see many Indian men wearing them in towns and cities. If you’re going to any formal type of event don’t wear shorts. Don’t go topless again unless you’re on the beach You don’t need to wear local clothing – even in villages. You’ll get a few odd looks if you wander India in a Salwar Kameez! The best bet? Jeans / Chinos and t-shirts / shirts. We recommend light jeans and cotton t-shirts or polo shirts for a slightly smarter look. Final Words of Advice If you research in advance like reading this post! and do your packing right you won’t have to worry about what to wear in India when you’re there! Job done! We recommend not packing too much flexibility and items you can mix/match are the key – not least because there are so many beautiful clothes scarves and accessories you’ll want to buy once you’re there!

So we paid our fifty cents US and got to Bangkok within about an hour and a half then grabbed some lunch at good ole KFC our last taste of fast food for a while and hopped on a 5 1/2 hour train for only $2! The train ride was hot dusty and smoky due to the burning trash and fields. We looked like coal miners by the end of it thanks to all the ashes and smoke hopefully we dont end up with black lung. Luckily we got on early in Bangkok and were able to have seats for the whole ride many people ended up standing for a lot of the trip. Most of the scenery along the way was rice patties either growing being burned or tilled and ready for planting. The other meaning to our blog title is all the sticky rice being sold on the train all day by vendors walking up and down the cars shouting what they Kids directing traffic As we came up to this one lane bridge we saw two very young children directing traffic. It was a totally blind spot so luckily they were good at their jobs! are selling over and over. Get your sticky rice only 10 baht sticky rice! that is what we think they were saying but we have no idea We arrived in Aranyaprathet which is on the border with Poipet Cambodia and found another backpacker with the same plans as us. We joined forces and found a very cheap hotel $5 that even gave us cold water upon arrival! The next moring we got up at the break of dawn to start across the border to Cambodia. We grabbed some street doughnuts and jumped in the local bus. When we arrived at the border it was complete choas people going every which way. Being white everyone was looking at us so people we directing us in no time and also asking how were going to get to the next city. We saw some other westerners so we stuck with them so we could share a taxi to the next town. After a long time of bargining we decided to get the taxi for $45. The book said taxi is the best way to get to Siem Reap and i see why the road really does suck as bad as the Transporting chickens! We saw all sorts of things being transported via motorbike including chickens as you see here and another one with a very large 200+ lbs pig strapped belly up kicking and screaming the whole way! books says. That is 3 and a half hours of various stages of construction most bad or really bad. Alll the bridges were being worked on at the same time so some had either a one lane bridge or a dirt road around it. At one point we were routed through a monastary with very narrow roads and very crude wood bridges so crude the buses wouldnt even attempt it thats saying a lot because the bus drivers in Asia are fearless. Surprisingly we got to Siem Reap in one peice without incident though we saw many other cars with flats or other problems along the way. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 5 Displayed 5 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Cara & Trevor CaraTrev Well our 3 month 10 day Asia trek ended April 29 2008 a month short because of political issues but otherwise a great experience.

For more info please see our disclosure here The Best of Train Travel in Sri Lanka Just the rails glinting in the afternoon sun a jagged slither of sand and the crashing sea. For miles and miles along the coast. That’s one of my lasting memories of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has always looked like the tear drop of India on the map to me. In reality the country covers an area of over 65000 square kilometres is about half the size of the UK and travel distances are often long. After years of being off-limits to travellers during decades of insurgence and bloody civil war Sri Lanka has seen steadily increasing visitor numbers since 2008/9. In the last couple of years it has continually made the ‘Top 10’s and ‘must see’s’ of guidebooks and travel sites worldwide. And with good reason. The train from Galle to Matara. Image courtesy of Bertrand Reiger via Alamy. In my view train travel is usually one of the best ways to see a country its landscapes its backyards and of course its people. Despite guesthouses and hotels trying to promote private drivers and advising us not to take the bus andtrain regularly during the trip train travel in Sri Lanka is one of my fondest memories.

This is the only way to book tickets online in advance and 12go now operate their own luxury Tea Train called the ViceRoy II along the Kandy to Ella route which can be booked exclusively through 12go.

The mainline south from Colombo runs to Galle and onwards about half way along the southern coastline to Matara. The second and most popular line for visitors is the tea train” line that runs to Badulla passing through Kandy Newara Eliya and Ella. There’s also another section of line that branches off north east towards Habarana for the cultural triangle Polonnaruwa and onwards to Trincomalee or Baticaloa on the east coast. The third line heads to northern Sri Lanka passing through Anuradhapura on the way to Jaffna. In practice trains are a great way of seeing the landscapes and connecting from Colombo to many of the other major cities but for journeys along the east coast or within central Sri Lanka you’ll likely find buses or hiring a car and driver more convenient as the train service is fairly spartan where it does exist. A train at Kandy Sri Lanka photo courtesy of Katerina Best Train Journeys in Sri Lanka Here are some of my favourite train journeys in Sri Lanka along with some tips for train travel in Sri Lanka. Colombo to Habarana by Train For this journey I was headed to Sigiriya in the heart of Sri Lanka. Habarana was the closest train station about a twenty minute drive from Sigiriya itself. This journey was the longest of my trip in Sri Lanka at around 8 hours. It was also the quietest. I boarded the train in Colombo Fort station in the early morning darkness at around 6am. The train was in darkness too and that’s the way it remained until dawn started to creep in. As we trundled slowly out of Colombo station daylight started to illuminate the gloomy carriages. It seemed odd to me that the lights inside the train were not switched on but this didn’t seem to phase the other passengers who on boarding promptly went back to sleep. After the rain paddy fields from the train to Habarana. We crawled through the drizzle and grey of Colombo suburbs to the north and east of the city slowly snaking our way away from concrete buildings towards rice fields and palm trees punctuated less and less frequently by corrugated iron rooftops. I tried to doze leaning my head against the window but as the train picked up speed the noise of the rattling of the train and vibration through the metal of the carriages only increased so as to make this a futile exercise. As we rattled towards the jungle the rain got increasingly heavy. The downpour added to the atmosphere. The drops drummed on the metal roof of the carriage and slushed everywhere outside the drips for the most part avoiding the open windows. The carriage was half full of Sri Lankan families travelling for the weekend to see relatives in the countryside but few going as far as Habarana. The train slowly emptied at intermittent halts which seemed to come out of the tropical greenery from nowhere. Love travelling by train? You can find our favourite train travel posts over here! Colombo Fort Train Station. Kandy to Colombo by Train In the centre of Sri Lanka the ancient kingdom of Kandy is an attraction in its own right and is Sri Lanka’s second largest city. At 500 metres above sea level it sits at the base of the knuckles mountain range and has a cooler climate than the jungle plains below. Kandy also serves as the gateway to Sri Lankan tea country. There are some tea plantations already up in the hills around Kandy and these get more plentiful higher up in the hills on the way to Ella. On the three hour trip we passed through mountains and jungle. The track wound around the side of the mountains hugging the rock on one side and on the other offering dramatic sweeping views of the valley below. The valleys green from the recent rain but now glinting in the sun stretched on for miles against a smoky blue background of more mountains in the distance. The journey from Kandy to Colombo. The route to/from Kandy to Colombo is one of the country’s most popular and several trains run per day. Getting on the train that started in Kandy as opposed to the one that runs all the way from Badulla and Ella proved to be a lucky decision as that meant seats were available when we got on the train in Kandy. The train quickly filled up along the three hour trip and by the time we had nearly reached Colombo the carriages were not only full with passengers sitting and standing but with people hanging on to the outside of the train to via handles and whatever they could grab hold of. Just outside the capital a man passed his backpack through the open window onto the lap of the lady sitting opposite me so that he could find space to hang on on the outside of the train. Giving my seat to an older lady who’d been standing next to me solicited a lot of giggling from bystanders—clearly regarding me as a stupid tourist for offering up my seat. Want more on Sri Lanka?

Colombo to Galle by Train and Beyond to Matara This is the one I’d been waiting for. When researching train travel in Sri Lanka I’d read about this journey online and seen the railway tracks of ‘The Coastal Line’ on my arrival in Colombo. In Colombo itself the railway line south runs between the city and the Indian Ocean from just beyond the famous Galle Face Hotel to the southern city limits and beyond. Leaving Colombo for the second time it was to a very different view than the first. The trains to Galle are Sri Lanka’s equivalent of the commuter line. Trains are full to overflowing with every scrap of space except possibly the high up luggage racks taken with someone standing sitting or hanging on outside. But the crowding was easy to forget if only for the reason that there was so much else to look at. As the train runs endlessly past the sea the boulders and rocks of Colombo’s shoreline turn into slivers of sandy beach next to beach shacks and huts. Standing in the open doorway the salt breeze provided welcome ventilation for the packed carriages. Looking west out towards the ocean the afternoon sun was edging its way downwards towards the horizon. This same seemingly blissful stretch of track was where the 2004 christmas tsunami hit Sri Lanka worst and 1500 plus people died on their way to Galle on the Matara Express train from Colombo to Matara which was hit by the wave. This was the largest single rail disaster in history. Repeated attempts to warn those on the train failed to reach them in time. The tracks just 200 meters from the sea edge were completely destroyed. The line from Colombo to Galle. The line has since been rebuilt and later upgraded to allow for faster journey times. After just two hours we arrived in Galle. Many trains terminate there but there are some that run further along the coast to Unawatuna Weligama Mirisa and Matara. There the view from the train is arguably its most beautiful over miles of sandy beaches surf and palm trees. I stayed on the train until nearly the end of the line which is much quieter too with the majority of people getting off in Galle. For anyone travelling in Sri Lanka if you take one train trip take this one. The view alone is worth the journey. Grab your Lonely Planet Guide to Sri Lanka here! The Train Journey in Sri Lanka that I didn’t Take – Colombo / Kandy to Ella by Train I have one regret from my trip to Sri Lanka. That is that I did not take the six hour train journey from Kandy to Ella. Ella is tea country proper and the line from Kandy—although winding and slow—takes you through beautiful mountains and tea plantations. I hope to one day experience that. Update the Tea Train has since become crazy popular with travellers so we’re actually not sure if we want to do this anymore! 🙁  Me on the train at Kandy station. Read more on Sri Lanka Learning to Surf with Soul & Surf Sri Lanka Train Travel in Sri Lanka – Travel Tips Train travel in Sri Lanka is a fairly relaxed affair certainly much more so than in neighbouring India. Advance buying of tickets is rarely necessary with the exception of some of the tourist trains on the Colombo – Kandy line. Here are some general pointers Most trains in Sri Lanka only have Second and Third class carriages which means no air conditioning. It can make travel very hot in summer months but personally I see this is a good thing open windows make for better photos and plenty of air. The doors stay open on most trains and doorways be sure to hold on though! are one of the best spots to stand if you’re looking to enjoy the view or take pictures. First class air conditioned is available on trains to Kandy and a special ‘Observation Car’ very large windows is available on tourist trains run by a private company. These are popular and require advance booking – we highly recommend using 12go for this. For overnight mail trains the only class with beds vs reclining seats is first class where bunks are in 4 berth cabins. Trains don’t generally have pantry/restaurant cars but vendors get on and off at different stations offering snacks. We recommend packing back up snacks and water with you. Almost all trains in Sri Lanka are day trains as distances are mostly not long enough for sleeper trains. There is one sleeper ‘night mail’ train that runs from Colombo to Batticaloa in the north. For unreserved seats you can just turn up at the station and buy these. Some trains are all unreserved all trains on the line to Galle are like this whereas most trains have reserved and unreserved carriages. The unreserved carriages will always be fuller and can get extremely crowded. For reserved seats you can buy these in advance from the station. The only way to buy tickets online is via 12go.asia – get your tickets here. Sri Lanka Train Travel FAQ’s What’s the best way to buy tickets? You can buy tickets at the train station once you’re in Sri Lanka but as some trains get very busy we highly recommend booking online here in advance if you’re travelling during high season and especially for the Kandy – Ella tea train. Which is the best train class of travel in Sri Lanka? Most of our journeys were in 2nd class which we found fine – windows are open providing plenty of breeze and are perfect for taking photos of the passing scenery. First class available on some trains includes tourist coaches available on the Colombo/Kandy to Ella route have vista observation domes and is air conditioned. Second Class is non air-conditioned and comes in reserved and unreserved and third class has wooden benches and gets very busy. We recommend 2nd Class reserved for open air views. Which is the Best Train Journey in Sri Lanka? This depends on your point of view! The most popular is the Ella Tea Train” but it’s also the most beset with instagrammers. Read our writeup of some of the other journeys above to decide which one is the best for you. Pin this post for later on Pinterest! Have you been to Sri Lanka or are you thinking of travelling there?

Not long after I moved in to the caravan I was well over the narrow bunkish bed and built a frame got a bed base from the Salvos and a Q-size mattress. It all fitted in with about a poofteenth to spare believe me this bed will not be getting out and now I have built some cupboards and it is totally locked down. And the bed is right at window level. So it means the bed is actually an infinity bed or a horizon bed you know? You look out to the edge and its just the wide open valley and the pink dawned hills to the east. 3 metres from the window my family of Eastern Grey kangaroos is feeding. Big Daddy best part of 2m tall and tough Mum is a bit smaller and their joey only young. They all take a few bites of grass and then stand up straight. Heads and ears rotating like those missile-aiming radars you see in the movies. As the light grows they move off silently down into the treeline. Maybe 1mm rain = 36 litres water a photo next time. The other night I had an attack of wombats. As friends were leaving late dusk a huge old wombat attacked us. Grunting and snorting he made little advance charges at us. Eventually he turned and ran I’d never seen a wombat move so quickly. Around here they have pest status because of their destructive behaviour digging out big holes that undermine creek banks and create traps for cattle. Each dusk they appear from nowhere and move down the slope. One crawled out from under the van one night nearly scared me to death. Then when I tried to help him on his way he turned on me spitting and snarling. So I helped him on his way with a shovel to the snout and he waddled off. Anyway the sun takes a while to actually break the seal but once it does it’s off like a beer drinker to the lemon tree……by 8am it’s in the thirties. The birds have been warming up and now they take over. More than I can identify yet but I am building a bird feeder and bath then they’ll be close enough to ID. I hope! car park Down in the gully the wildlife is always active. I usually disturb a wallaby or 2 at the waterholes and now I have seen one of the lyrebirds in the flesh. I had heard an extraordinary bird noise on several occasions and suspected a lyrebird but I had never actually seen him. Here he was making such a bizarre series of noises like a pump starting mechanical clanking splashing of water just mind boggling. I’ve had a couple of pretty testing storms so I’m now confident of the roof staying on. Well it will stay connected to the deck and the van. Last Wednesday it started out hot and by noon the Northerly started blowing. It was like a blowtorch across the block. 44 degrees and the trees were being thrashed by 100 kph winds. The roof was straining the whole caravan was rocking. Then it calmed down about 5pm finally some peace. Then it turned as the southerly started up and blew back at me almost as strong. The temp dropped to 24 in an hour and the smell of smoke from bushfires down south was strong in the air. I woke about midnight to the sound sunrise over the horizon bed of gentle rain couldn’t believe it. 5 or 6mm and for the first time I could hear water running into the big tank. Probably the best part of 200 litres!! I don’t think I’ll ever understand cow behaviour. Over the road from the Angledale house a mob of cows is in the paddock. Most of them have calved in the past few months so there are a couple of dozen calves ranging in age from a few days to a few months even some twins. They romp around like kids at kindergarten while the cows loll about chewing their cuds lying together under the shade of the big pine trees casually keeping their eyes on the kids…just like the Mums at the swimming pool in summer. Yesterday the calves went racing down to the bottom of the paddock and started mucking about mock head-butting pawing the earth chasing to establish a pecking order…meanwhile the cows slowly followed down to watch them. At the weekend we had more rain. I’d gone up to the block to sow some more seed and by the time I got back to the house it was raining steadily. The cows were inside not exactly e space Doctor kitchen and bed end labouring back up the hill. I don’t know why as there was no more shelter there than down the bottom. They were mooing mournfully and the calves were for once quite obediently following their mums closely. Yesterday I noticed one of our house bulls was missing called out on the job no doubt his buddy was a bit disconsolate and has been proto-mooing a low burble quite out of keeping with his huge potent bulk. He can smell the fecund cows in the paddock opposite and strains against the fence in lust. The bull that’s in with the cows charges up to his fence and starts pawing the ground like a real bull fighting bull…it’s on. Well where did that come from?…actually a few weeks ago. So I haven’t written much at all much to the delight of some of you! The house plans are slowly getting done probably start something in Feb/March when the worst of the heat and fire danger has passed. The caravan is decked and roofed the composting dunny seems to be functioning the 12v solar shower is good until 6 when the heat starts to go out of the waterbag the electronica plants around the batter slopes are holding on the beer is brewing the power is on the TV and internet work and it is soo peaceful and relaxing. I’m over all the xmas bullshit but it is a fantastic opportunity to catch up with family and friends so I won’t say No !! So I do hope you all have a lovely time over this festive period and I look forward to your visit!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 10 Displayed 10 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 5 Message Bill Shum unpaidbill Bill Shum Unpaidbill.....Motorcycle riding in North Central and South America. 70000 kms from LA - South to Ushaia Tierra del Fuego Argentina The End of the World then back to LA then up North to Deadhorse Prudhoe Bay Alaska The Top of the World. 18 countries 35 border crossings 15 months.

Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 234shares Sustainable travel is a lot easier with a little help from eco friendly travel products! Here are our tried and tested favourite eco friendly travel products and ultimate packing list for eco friendly travel – Staying sustainable on the road has never been easier! This post contains compensated affiliate links. Please find our disclosure at the end of this post or read our policy here. Our Packing Guide + Favourite Eco Friendly Travel Products This packing list is full of the best eco friendly travel products to help minimise the impact of your trip as much as possible. We’ve put in all of the products we use love and recommend from our trips as well as new ideas we’ve received from friends and fellow conscious travellers along the way. When it comes to travelling with minimal impact we know that travel can never be 100% sustainable we find that fore-warned is fore-armed. Many of our go to places on our travels street food public transport anyone are ironically the situations where you might get most stuck. Longing for some fresh coconut water but the vendor only has plastic straws? On a long train journey and running out of water? We know from personal experience the plastic water bottles for sale start to look tempting. A few simple accessories” can go a long way to avoid the need of ever having to buy single-use plastic products. If it seems like an investment to buy so many products ahead of travel it’s worth remembering how much many of these products save in the long run – both environmentally and economically. An investment into a water filter bottle will quickly pay itself back with money saved on buying bottled water. Last but not least we want to spell out that it’s not about being perfect”. We know we’ve certainly had moments where we’ve had to resort to buying something in plastic because we were really hungry forgot our metal straws etc. Those moments are bound to happen. The point is that with a little preparation we will be able to avoid 90%+ waste that can often be incurred with travel – which is a huge! 🙂 The Best Eco Friendly Travel Products To help make this packing list as easy to use as possible we’ve divided it into several categories. Happy packing! The Essentials Eating and Drinking Toiletries Travel Accessories Luggage & Travel Bags Clothing Should you offset your carbon? Sustainable Travel Essentials In a hurry or only want to take a few things with you? In our humble opinions the following sustainable travel products are game changers and should be part of anyone’s sustainable travel kit! Water to Go water filter bottle if travelling to a country where tap water is not safe to drink plus extra filters Refillable Klean Kanteen bottle if travelling to a country where tap water is safe to drink Bamboo or Stainless Steel drinking straws Bamboo cutlery Your pick from our toiletries recommendations below Reef-safe and natural Sunscreen Eco Friendly Travel Products for Eating & Drinking Much of the single use plastic we use on our travels comes in the form of plastic straws shopping bags and take-out drinks containers / plastic cutlery. By taking re-usable products with us and keeping them in our day bag we cut out the need to consume these completely! Refillable Water Bottles Water purification bottle such as a Water to Go or Grayl if you’re likely to travel to places where tap water is unsafe. Read our full guide to water filter bottles here. A Stojo or thermos mug for hot drinks Compact tiffin” lunchbox set for food on the go Re-usable Cutlery Produce bags for grocery shopping Bamboo straws or Stainless Steel Straws Skip the plastic packaging with bars vs bottles of soap Eco Friendly Toiletries There are so many wonderful eco-friendly cosmetic and toiletry brands to choose from these days it can be a little overwhelming! Our suggestion for travel in general is to opt for solid products vs liquid ones where possible e.g. shampoo bars soaps instead of body wash stick deodorant etc. Choosing these means a lighter load you won’t be carrying around 90% water and you can take more with you – great if you’re going on a longer trip! We suggest sharing products between couples / family members if you can! We specifically don’t recommend LUSH products here. We’ve seen them recommended on many an eco-friendly travel blog and we’ve even used them ourselves too but we have found that far from being eco-friendly they are actually full of harsh chemicals. The shampoo bar made our scalps dry and itchy and LUSH has recently got into a lot of hot water with advertising standards for their products not being as natural as they may seem… An eco friendly toiletry bag – like this one! Organic Shampoo bar like this one Body soap bar like this one + this soap case to keep it nice. If you’re travelling longer term and prefer liquid soap we recommend Dr Bronners which comes in concentrated form and can be used for hair body and even clothes washing! Bamboo Toothbrushes Reef-safe and Natural Sun Screen/Block Natural Insect Repellant Plastic-free cotton buds Feminine Products I recommend either the Organicup menstrual cup or organic cotton period underwear like this set. Non-Toxic Stick Deodorant Raw Coconut Oil we use this instead of taking after-sun and different moisturisers as Coconut Oil does the job perfectly!. Make sure to buy raw rather than the processed stuff! Essential Oils – if you’re prone to dry skin mould in humid climates or other skin conditions find the best essential oil for you and take with you. Tea Tree & Lavender are both great for skin irritation and fungal skin infections while peppermint is one of the best natural air fresheners around! Make sure to buy organic ones! Linen turkish towels / facecloths. Lightweight absorbent natural and easily washable – we like this one or check out House of Jude if you’re in Canada. Depending on where you live we have a few different favourite eco-friendly brands for toiletries. If you live in the UK we love Guiltless Skin for their face oils and serums which have kept our skin hydrated on the road. In Canada we love the Great Canadian Hemp Company. Eco Friendly Travel Accessories Here are some of our favourite sustainable travel accessories from our trips We love Pala Eyewear’s latest range of Bio and Recycled Acetate Sunglasses Ladies’ scarves – always useful for travel! We love these ones made from Hemp. Cotton tote bags useful for separating laundry shopping as a beach bag etc etc! Solar power bank / charger – this one has two USB ports and lasts for 4 phone charges. Compostable PELA Phone Case Solar Powered Lamp Eco Yoga mat made from natural jute Eco Friendly Luggage & Travel Bags Perhaps the most important part – what we put all of our favourite eco travel products in! Luckily there are some great eco friendly bags on the market. We love our Osprey backpacks – we’ve been using our Osprey Farpoint 40 for many a trip and it’s still going strong. For those who prefer their luggage with wheels we are fans of Samsonite’s new Eco Nu range – an entire range of suitcases that are made out of recycled plastic bottles! Eco-Friendly Clothing for Travel Sustainable fashion is a topic in its own right but here are a few of our favourite ethical / sustainable accessories we like to take with us Basic bamboo vests & organic cotton t-shirts great for keeping cool! Leggings & Yoga wear made from recycled plastic by Teeki Sustainable Swimwear – some of our favourite companies are Vitamin A Swim Londre and Summersalt Should you Offset your Carbon? We don’t believe that carbon offsetting is a solution to making travel more sustainable – rather the change in behaviour and creating less impact when we travel has to come from the tourism industry travel providers and us as travellers. Paying someone else to offset our carbon is not enough. That said we do encourage people to look into the option of offsetting in addition to travelling more consciously.

My main travel essential – a water bottle with a built-in filter! I travel mainly around Asia and it’s a lifesaver here since the tap water is not safe for drinking. Though in many places now they have water coolers where you can refill your bottle. Absolutely love this! But then my filter-bottle is perfect for travelling to rural areas. I use the LifeStraw bottle when I go trekking and hikes or hiking. I can easily take water from the river and drink it right away. While others have to wait until we reach a guesthouse to buy water or they have to use purification tablets which make the water smell and taste like swimming pool.

Only 27 Kilometres away from Katoomba as the crow flies but 74 kilometres by road! On our way we made a quick stop at Govetts Leap Lookout near Blackheath. The falls here are known as the Bridal Veil Falls or simply Govetts Leap. One more stupendous view of a rugged Blue Mountains valley this time the Grose Valley. Back on the road we made it to Jenolan Caves nearly an hour before our scheduled cave tour at 11.30am. The weather associated with the polar vortex dumped snow on this part of the world last weekend closing the road to Jenolan Caves. Knowing that there could still be a bit of snow and ice by the road we decided to allow plenty of time for the trip. There was a bit of snow by the road especially where it had been pushed to the side by snow clearing vehicles and patches of snow in the paddocks but nothing that hampered our trip. With our tickets purchased online we checked in at the guide office and found out where we should be at the appointed time to meet the guide. We Bridal Veil Falls still had plenty of time to spare and there was the smell of bacon in the air so we decided to go into the cafe for bacon and egg rolls. We have eaten so much bacon on this holiday. One of the guides recommended the hot chocolate so I ate a bacon and egg roll AND washed it down with a hot chocolate! Just as well I was about to climb 912 steps in and around Lucas Cave!! At 11.30am we met our guide Tanya near the entrance to Lucas Cave. After a quick rundown on the rules - no food no drinks other than water no selfie sticks or tripods and no touching the caves surfaces - we started up the stairs to the entrance. Tanya assured us that most of the stair climbing would be completed by the time we made our way inside. The structures inside Lucas Cave were very varied and impressive. There were examples of most of the structures associated with limestone caves straws stalactites stalagmites columns flow stone and shawls. And on today’s tour we experienced a little something extra. We arrived in one of the larger chambers of the cave and Snow on the way to Jenolan Caves Tanya said that a member of our group had an announcement to make. The next thing we knew there was a young guy down on bended knee asking his girlfriend to marry him!! She said Yes and there was a resounding round of applause for the young couple. Aawww. After we exited the cave we made our way around to the Blue Lake which Tanya had pointed out to us from near the cave entrance and recommended that we visit while in the area. Since it was such a short walk to the lake we had a quick look to admire its aquamarine waters. We gave the Caves Cafe some more patronage buying sandwiches for lunch before continuing our journey. We had a crimson rosella today who was very interested in sharing our lunch with us but there were sign up everywhere saying ‘Do Not Feed the Birds’ ... so we didn’t. It was a beautiful afternoon to be on the road as we were lucky enough to have fine sunny weather again today. We passed a lot of farms along the way. There were some cattle but they were well and truly outnumbered by sheep. Bernie Jenolan Hotel said something about lots of merino sheep which triggered something in his memory banks about the BIG Merino in Goulburn. He must’ve retained this from when I was reading out the list of ‘big things’ on the first day of our holiday. So of course we had to stop in Goulburn to visit the BIG Merino. We needed to stretch our legs and take a comfort break anyway! It was pretty obvious straight away that this is the biggest big thing that we have visited during this holiday. There is a merino gift shop adjacent to the ram so we popped in for a quick look. The fine merino and merino blend garments on display were gorgeous but oh so pricey. We managed to make it out with a couple of greeting cards and a hat. After a short stretch on the Hume Highway we turned off onto the Federal Highway towards Canberra passing along the shore of Lake George on the way. At the moment there is little to differentiate Lake George from other farmland that we passed today. The lake goes through phases of filling and evaporating and when it is dry or mostly dry farmers Lucas Cave run the stock on it. Today we could see cows sheep ad kangaroos grazing on the lake bed. As we approached Canberra a full moon was rising which looked rather spectacular. We checked into the Motel Kurrajong for the last two nights of our holiday and hauled all the baggage from the car to our accommodation for the last time. The next time we unload the car we will be back at home. The restaurants nearby were a bit on the pricey side so we ventured out to the Canberra Club which is only a couple of hundred metres from the hotel. Reasonable food at a reasonable price ... and we didn’t have to get dressed up. The girls really are on a roll with two more wins tonight in the Bolivia Challenge.

This post has been on my mind for a few months now as a follow-up to the post about me gaining weight while I was traveling. I was going to title it How I Have Lost My Travel Weight with all of the workouts and new habits that I have employed to get back to a leaner and more muscular me but in the end I’ve decided I really don’t like this title or this topic at all. Because all throughout my life I have been way too preoccupied with how I look. I learned this from a society that is obsessed with looks. Has this celebrity gained weight? Is she pregnant? 10 Celebrities Who Never Seem to Age. or worse yet 10 Celebrities Who Have Aged Horribly. It’s messed up man. Every day on my Instagram feed at the grocery store checkout and in transit I am constantly confronted with ‘perfect bodies’ and the same damn aesthetic often photo shopped or just with amazing angles and lighting While I have lost about 10 pounds of fat I really don’t want that to be the focus here. I want the topic of this article to be health. Much of the reason why I gained weight previously is because I was not taking care of myself. I noted in the article about gaining weight that I often looked in the mirror and felt a mountain of self loathing holding me down. I really hated the girl who was looking back at me. That is so sad. I was not acting in healthy ways A few months later I worked my way out of my spiral of self-pity and I had started to lose some of the weight through healthy diet and exercise and most of all working on self love. This was not an easy road. It took some time before I saw changes but I stuck to it because at the very least the endorphins felt great. I tracked my progress in a follow up post and when I was starting to feel better about my body again a few really rude comments about my ‘boxy ass’ came through on Instagram and on this blog. I wrote about them a bit on here because I wanted to take the power away from the trolls by exposing the ugly nature of body shaming rather than just pretending it wasn’t happening. I wish I could say that they didn’t get to me. But I do look in the mirror and wonder about my ass. A few people mentioned that I shouldn’t listen and even others said that I was overreacting and that body shaming is just a normal part of life for women. Oh yeah trolls? Here’s my ass again. Discuss. But I think it’s only normal because we allow it. It’s not about being skinny or having the perfect body it’s about achieving your perfect body – the one that makes you feel good empowered and healthy. So instead of how to get skinny this post is actually about getting healthier. It is so much more than physical. Being healthy is in large part mental. Here’s what I’m doing to stay leaner more muscular and a lot healthier Not making excuses about my diet on the road In Patagonia I often said that I couldn’t eat healthier because of lack of availability. However I could have gone to greater efforts to cook my own food and it wouldn’t have hurt if I laid off the ice cream and nightly wine either. Eating whole foods – mostly plants The easiest way for me to drop weight is to stop eating carbs that don’t occur from whole foods. So I allow lentils beans and sweet potatoes but cut out bread pasta and sugars that don’t come from fruits and other whole foods. Allow a cheat day It’s still important to enjoy myself so cheat days are allowed! Sampling the local cuisine even the unhealthy stuff is part of the travel experience. I just limit it more than I used to. Finding exercises you really enjoy Find that thing you look forward to. If you hate running why run? Maybe you will like dance aerobics or swimming or Pilates much more. This is what works for me Finding YouTube workouts that require no equipment and that I enjoy particularly PopSugar fitness and Blogilates. I also made a playlist for exercises I can even do when I don’t have a mat so there are no excuses! Groupon on the go I search for classes that I can get discounts to when I know I’ll be in an area for any reasonable length of time. I take a weekly pole dancing class now in Berlin. It’s empowering and even though I’m sore for almost a week following each class I can tell I’m getting way stronger with each passing week. Working exercise into travels Make your vacations active ones! I love to go paddling like in Manitoba and swimming diving and hiking. In cities in Europe I walk. I always look for ways to make a trip active for the nature and for my body. I’m not gonna lie it helped tremendously that over the summer I had two more or less back-to-back 8-day treks one in Kyrgyzstan and one in Alaska. Alcohol I probably owe most of my previous weight gain to my drinking habits. Now that I really think about it I was having at least one drink almost every day when I was traveling but usually more. I haven’t had any alcohol for over three months now but that’s another post entirely. Spent three days canoeing – a good workout in a gorgeous place! Apart from all of these things the biggest thing of all was knowing why I was doing it and why getting healthy was important apart from aesthetics. I really wanted to be stronger. There are a lot of sports that I love doing – like through multi-day hiking where I am carrying roughly 30% of my body weight and diving where again I am carrying pretty heavy gear and recently pole dancing. All of these things have a high potential of injuring me if I am not strong enough to do them. The other thing is if I do not break up my work day by doing some exercise I tend to isolate myself too much and then I start feeling weird. Feeling strong seeing results and feeling confident I also needed to work on my self-love. Wow what a journey that has been! The Emotional Freedom Technique and Six Pillars of Self Esteem I mentioned here and the Life Coach I mentioned here have both been so helpful for that as was the decision to stop having alcohol which I promise to talk about in a later post. It also helped to just start. By taking healthy actions every day then I feel encouraged to take other healthy actions like going out for walks meeting up with people and being social or going to the damn grocery store and all of those other little things that should be normal activities but for me sometimes are difficult to do. At this point I have lost the 15 or so pounds of fat that I was carrying around and gained a bit of it back in muscle. I’m happy with where I am and my only goal is to keep getting healthier. In the end I hope this is helpful because I really don’t want this article to come from a place of everyone should be skinny everyone should look like me. I don’t like this perpetuation of the idea that only slim bodies are beautiful – not that there’s anything wrong with that I’m predisposed to be skinny myself – but it’s just one out of many body shapes and sizes.

I do these in the morning because it starts my day off really well. And they have an offline player. I also try to make my breakfasts oatmeal smoothie if possible and carry some cut veggies an apple or almonds in my purse. I’m often at my happiest when travelling because I’m relaxed and it usually helps me better keep in a routine. Thanks for this post! I love how you keep true to yourself and keep positive. Reply GG says 10/24/2017 at 150 pm Hi Kristin. Well put. You effectively made the focus on a healthy you and not on looks. Based on looking at the links you have provided the amount of reading you have done on these subjects and the common sense recommendations you make I can tell you that you have not only kept yourself healthier physically but have challenged and exercised your mind. You are showing great wisdom and intelligence. Health is holistic you are only as strong as your weakest point and you are trying to cover all the angles. A healthy mind and body go hand in hand and so happy for you and your accomplishments. Congrats on losing the weight the way you are doing it you will keep it off. Funny thing is I am referring to the emotional weight as much as the physical. Also funny is how so much of beauty shines from those who exude power love confidence and inner peace. Being satisfied with how one looks and physical appearance is part of our nature but have been pushed too much to the forefront. Feeling strong and empowered is more the ticket. You are not kidding about the alcohol and weight that is low hanging fruit. And I looked up pole dancing since not heard of that as an exercise and holy cow wow you must be getting pretty strong! I and others here should try that some time because I have trouble with standard weights for building muscle.. I am more a use your own body weight and stretches type of person I have to stretch a lot I am not flexible at all plus lots of running. I wish I could say something to you about trolls to make you feel better about them but you seem to be handling it better than I would honestly if I were in your situation. The only comment is one of scale it used to be there might be one jerk in a room or in a crowd. Now with the world wide web we are in front of thousands and thousands of people the 0.001% can make some noise. It will hurt what they say but you have become so much stronger than that. Won’t be able to keep them away but what you are doing here puts them to shame. As for my thoughts to contribute if you have covered any of these feel free to provide everyone a blue link to them  1. I like using stretch bands color coded for how much tension. You can do exercises anywhere with those just need something to wrap around. It helped me regain my strength in my calf muscles my injured calf became bigger than my healthy one in a few months! Can be used for stretches and strengthening. 2. Sleep How much sleep do you get Kristin? I imagine traveling being so active hiking would bring the need for extra of this. However everyone has their circadian rhythm more into night than day need 9 versus 7.5 hours a night etc. but as a person who has frequently tried to buy time and sleep deprive it isn’t worth it and it is hard to break the habit. This is one I am working on but this is vital to a healthy you. In addition to length positioning is vital as so many injuries are a result of poor positioning. Imagine posing for 7 hours while you are awake uncomfortably. That is what many do in their sleep and wonder why they have a sudden jolt of pain in the middle of the following day. Funny thing is I sleep really well when traveling versus at home and feel more in control. 3. Posture Not really exercise but if you want to stay limber and strong as you get older this is very important for the back. So any exercises that work on the posture are good. I think though what you are doing Kristin covers this a lot so this may not count as an additional contribution! 4. This might sound not so pleasant but another important healthy thing which you can avoid by not eating those not wholesome” carbs is regarding your digestive system. Make sure to eat foods that avoid constipation. Better to be slightly the other way if can’t be just right”. This is very hard to accomplish in traveling though! 5.Make sure to leave gaps between eating and exercise. All the people in track and field I have dealt with seem to be so impatient with this and with waiting the necessary time to recover from injuries!. Hope this stuff is helpful! Reply Laura says 10/25/2017 at 456 am I usually gain weight when in other countries because of the different food. I cook all my meals myself but abroad I don’t want to be rude and say no to food I’m invited to. It’s already a balance act being a vegetarian / part-time vegan. You inspired me to pay more attention on what I eat while travelling and to say no to things that don’t make me feel good. Reply Kristin says 10/25/2017 at 603 am So much respect for maintaining a vegetarian and vegan diet when abroad! That’s something I’d like to lean more towards as well. Reply Deborah says 10/25/2017 at 528 am Nice post with helpful information. I think many people struggle with the same thing. About the bodyshaming some people are just really stupid. I love reading your posts en stories.love your personality. All you can do is being true to yourself and be the best you can be and not worrying about the opinion of other people that arent dear to you. Easily said i struggle every day with my weight ?  but i’m getting better at it! That’s the best of getting older! Reply Kristin says 10/25/2017 at 602 am SO TRUE – the older I get the fewer fcks I give about anyone else’s opinion of my body. Reply Ijana Loss says 10/25/2017 at 1230 pm Great post! It’s so hard to be healthy on the road. I commend you for doing so well on improving it making changes like that is not easy and especially not while traveling. I try and find a CrossFit box to drop into wherever I go but traveling is just begging for overindulgence. The alcohol is a big one too I’ve been thinking I need to stop drinking it as well. I’m living in Germany right now hey that makes two of us! and everyone loves beer here and I’ve kind of jumped on the wagon and perhaps need to tone it down a bit XD Reply Kristin says 10/26/2017 at 234 am Germany is also home to alkoholfrei beer! But I don’t think it’s all that delicious. Cutting out alcohol has been really good for me in terms of my time being better spent now my money my body everything. Reply Charlotte McGhee says 10/25/2017 at 451 pm Meditation! This is the thing that I’ve been hearing we should all do but it only clicked recently and I’m so grateful. What a beautiful way to start your day and shut out the trolls! Huzzah for being healthy while traveling and always! Reply Kristin says 10/26/2017 at 232 am Same I’ve only forced myself to make it a daily thing recently and it changed everything. Reply Elina says 10/26/2017 at 901 am I love your self-reflecting posts Kristin the whole reason I’m such a big fan of your blog is that you’re not just doing 10 best things to do in wherever” type of stuff. I really like how you said an ideal body should be YOUR ideal body not something that someone or something else thinks is ideal – I mean even if I did have the perfect” body and someone told me that it wouldn’t matter at all if it wasn’t the body I was striving for. Staying healthy on the road can be so damn difficult. For me the biggest thing is that I’m missing my usual sports classes I hate the gym and that I’m eating sweets like every damn day just to get some energy and cope with travel stress… But even with that I think travelling has actually helped me gain a better body image. My body hasn’t really changed much over the last few years just my attitude towards it. Anyway thanks for writing about important semi-travel related stuff! Keep doing it please! Reply Kristin says 10/27/2017 at 1246 am Hi Elina thanks for the feedback! I’m glad you like these posts. I try to cope with the stress more with the gratitude lists. However truth be told I eat a lot of candy lately too! a girl’s gotta live. Reply Natalia says 10/28/2017 at 655 pm Walking is a must when I travel. Where possible I explore places on foot sometimes armed with a good podcast. You also see more that way! Reply c s says 10/31/2017 at 810 am When we travel I try to limit how much and what I eat. At home I do low carb and I try to continue that abroad. For breakfast I eat eggs and coffee and maybe a tiny bit of fruit with a small amount of plain yogurt for a treat. I have had pastries in some countries and just have found they are not that good to me so I skip them. I also don’t eat lunch just breakfast and dinner. Being in such beautiful places we walk constantly and I just don’t think about food. I did find one time when we travelled when I also ate lunch or large amounts of food then I did gain that time. I don’t drink as it makes me feel awful so that takes care of the issue for me. Reply Kristin says 10/31/2017 at 155 pm Oh man I actually have to do the opposite – I eat all throughout the day but small meals. I get hangry otherwise! Reply Erica says 11/03/2017 at 947 am I got super excited when I read you’ve started pole dancing! I’m glad to hear you’re in love with it it tends to have an oddly healing effect on people. I’ve been poleing for 4 years and I currently teach it at a studio just outside Toronto so if you’re ever in Toronto and looking to get a practice in….. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 11/03/2017 at 337 pm Absolutely! It’s a new obsession for sure. Just started doing twice per week. I have never been this strong in my life I’m loving it! Reply Skyler says 11/12/2017 at 707 am Thanks for posting about this Kristin! I’ve been traveling 9 months now and while at first I saw myself thinning down from the daily active life that is travel vs sitting at my office desk all day you’re 1000% right about the alcohol and eating. They’re starting to show. It’s so tough when being social at hostels and meeting new friends because the bonding usually occurs over eating and drinking. I just ordered a travel yoga mat and am trying to work on adding meditation into my daily life. Because in the end it’s really not about being skinny but instead about self care. It’s not easy it requires effort that is totally worth it. Thanks for giving me the encouragement I needed. Keep kicking ass girl Skyler Reply Kristin says 11/12/2017 at 936 am Glad you connected with it Skyler! Yeah it can be hard with the pressures associated with hostel bonding being over drinks. I wonder how it’ll be when I’m back in hostels but abstaining. I’m curious to see! Reply Brian says 11/12/2017 at 1222 pm Wow great post! I’m not on the road that much anymore but I wish I will be soon enough 🙂 Thanks for the tips they will surely come in handy for many people! Reply Erin says 02/06/2018 at 738 pm Really enjoyed your post! I have been following Cassie and blogilates for years! When I lived with my parents I would do her workout videos in my bedroom. I don’t do her workouts anymore but still follow her blog posts. I found that what I truly enjoy the most is group fitness classes such as barre TRX spin as well as yoga. To be honest I am super lazy and I would prefer to show up and do what I’m told as opposed to planning my own workout and having to think about it! I’m glad to hear that you have been learning to love yourself better and look forward to hearing about why you quit alcohol. Reply Pearl Accountants says 07/21/2018 at 318 am Very nice. Its a useful post with helpful information. I think most of the people have got problem with the same thing. thank you Kristin. Reply Charlotte says 08/26/2018 at 407 am Great blogpost! I think your ass is perfectly fine. 😉 Just discovered your blog and exploring all the articles and you are totally awesome for doing al those epic hikes! <3 Reply Kristin says 09/04/2018 at 156 pm Thank you! Much love. Reply Goldie says 12/24/2018 at 118 am I love how she really shows us what she really eats healthy unlike other models claiming they eat pizza and junk food unhealthy which means that they properly had slice of pizza for the entire day or in other words starving themselves.﻿ Reply Jessica Hill says 12/29/2018 at 650 pm Nice post! It’s so hard to motivate yourself to keep healthy while traveling but if it’s for longer periods of time then you have no choice but to establish SOME sort of routine right?! 😉 Reply Kristin says 12/29/2018 at 756 pm That’s what I found! Reply Martina Baum says 10/16/2019 at 1032 pm This was such a good read. Thanks for sharing this very important tips when traveling. This helped a lot. Reply travautood says 10/17/2019 at 119 am Travel beyond limits is something that is beyond someone imagination. It’s sink or swim on the road. You either get better at making friends or you end up alone crying each night into a pillow. You learn to make friends out of strangers and get more comfortable talking to new people. When I first started traveling I was kind of an introvert and uncomfortable talking to those I didn’t know. Now I’ll happily talk to strangers like we’ve been best friends for years. Travel not only makes you comfortable talking to strangers it makes you better at it too. After talking to people all the time the same questions get boring. You start to even bore yourself. After a while you don’t care about where people are from where they are going how long they’ve been traveling.

It served as the seat of power and the capitol of the Kingdom of Siam from 1350-1767 when it was then sacked looted and burned by the Burmese. The city now serves as a UNESCO Historical site and with the numerous temples and palaces it is easy to imagine its past splendor. The historical site is surrounded by rivers and moats isolating an island that is filled with the ruins. The natural barriers made it an easy choice to build the capitol of the fallen empire. I came to see the ruins and as I toured the many sites for the first time I truly felt I was in the Asia that I had dreamt about half a world away. Getting to Ayutthaya form Kanchanaburi was simple. All of the tour agencies and my guesthouse wanted to sell me a ticket for $400b for the four hour journey. I knew I could do better as public transport in the North is much better and easier to navigate than it is down South. The long and the short is I walked to the bus station in Kanchanaburi and looked at the map. I hopped hot room So unbelievably hot in my accommodation onto a bus $70b for Suphanburi two hours to the North. I then transferred onto another bus for two hours Eastbound for Ayutthaya $90b. Do the math and chalk up a victory for this guy. Once at my destination I found a sweltering room for $200b. As I only wanted to stay here for one day my first order of business was to get a ticket out of town. I took the ferry boat to the train station and bought a ticket to the far North of Thailand. $766B for a sleeper berth on the night train for the 13 hour journey the following evening. This was the last ticket available on the entire train. Things were working out quite well for me. Up early the next morning - 11am - I rented yet another bicycle $30b from the guesthouse where I stayed so I could explore the various ruins of the old historical centre. Whilst riding in the South East Asian sunshine I had a few random thoughts cross my mind. The first of which was that my knee has not felt this good since it was broken on that cursed hit on the ice back in December reclaim 2011. Second was that amidst the trees and the lakes of Ayutthaya I felt I could be riding back in my beloved Washington Park except that instead of the majestic Rockies to my West I had layers of ancient ruins over 600 years all around me. This was not the first time I have drawn random comparisons in my head and it is sure to not be the last. With the golden hues of the equatorial gleam upon my shoulders I came upon a temple where a statue of The Buddha had been swallowed by Mother Nature and reclaimed by the test of time. This sight that saturated my eyes among others whetted my thirsting appetite for the impending journey to the mighty Wats of Angkor to the East. Overall just a really pleasant afternoon riding around and exploring the hidden gems of this ancient city. After the end of the long day I returned the bike grabbed my bags and headed off to the train station for my overnight journey to Chiang Mai. The ride on the train was great as I had never been on an overnight train before. I grabbed a few beers at the wat2 bar car and off to sleep I went and surprisingly slept very well with the rocking of the train and the sounds of the track passing below. I stayed two days in Chiang Mai and I didnt care for this place. I took 3 photos if that tells you anything. Its my own fault really. I had an expectation in my mind of what this city would be like and of course it was not like I had imagined it. The thing with expectations is that they always lead to disappointment so I try to not have any. Opting not to go for any of the over touristy hill trekking in the area and with the crowds all heading West to Pai I hopped onto a bus North to a tiny town called Thaton four hours away smack on the Burmese border in the far North of Thailand without a clue or a plan. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 22 Displayed 22 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 9 Message Travis McComas TravelbyTravis My name is Travis.

After hearing so many people rave about their cruising adventures we decided to pull up the anchor set the main sail and steer a course for the Far East taking the plunge and booking our first cruise! 🌞🚢 Wed decided on one around the middle east as it wasnt a destination we were likely to go to independently. Royal Caribbean were recommended to us and it was booked - 7 nights UAE Qatar & Bahrain. Fast forward to January this year and tensions arounds the middle east were once again heightened. This of course made us very nervous of our impending trip and the insurance and cruise company were unhelpful as the UK Government hadnt declared it a no go area which meant in their eyes we were all good to go. 😰. The holiday had already caused stress due to the stringent UAE medication guidelines Bahrain visas and extras we had to decide on with Royal Caribbean. Thankfully the UAE were very helpful with regards to the medication so I had all the correct documentation not checked of course but there you go..... The Bahrain lot were not at all helpful which left our YUMMY BREKKIE AT THE COTE BRASSERIE visa application in limbo but we figured it was only one port and we might have been able to sort it at the time. As for Royal Caribbean we would have had to take out a second mortgage to cope with all the extras so left it at a couple of excursions in Dubai 💰. Anyway back to the point very nervous about the trip but again not wanting to lose our money as obviously this was a more expensive venture than our usual jaunts. Luckily my massage lady Julie had worked on cruise ships and reassured us that they wouldnt be cruising if there was any danger at all 😌.And as it happened the itinerary changed a few days before we were due to set sail and Bahrain was no longer on the list of ports - that was the visa issue sorted then. We had a full day planned on the day of departure. Things had been tense at home as I had lost my job 😢 due to store closure that week and was generally feeling quite low so a trip to my favourite eatery for breakfast was on the cards - Cote Brasserie. HILTON GARDEN INN KRALOW This meant an early start from Galashiels and with parking in Edinburgh being very expensive it was time to hit the park and ride 🚌 but thankfully all went well and we were soon tucking into their delicious french toast 😋. The next stop was across town to get my nails done 💅. I had received a voucher from Dad & Barbara for my birthday and it seemed the best time to redeem it. Despite the sunny outlook it was of course January with its bitterly cold winds so into a taxi 🚕 onto Laureston Place. So whilst I was treated to a pedicure and manicure Andrew headed back to the Park and Ride to collect the car no doubt via the model railway shop. It was then off to the airport we had booked the very cheap low cost parking away from the airport which thankfully worked as planned and we were soon through security and deciding on eateries. As we were there early we decided it was probably a good opportunity to try out the Edinburgh airport lounge 💓 The food offering wasnt vast but it did have comfy seats the only downside was a bunch of hens ARRIVED AT DUBAI cackling very loudly 😫. Thankfully we managed to sit far enough away in order to keep the murderous section of my brain at a calm level. It was soon time for our flight ✈. We had opted to fly to Krakow and go into a hotel 🏨 there before flying out to Dubai. This had the added advantage of avoiding the rather sadistic overnight direct flight to Dubai on top of saving the pennies. The flight was seamless and we were soon at the hotel in Krakow. We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn which was literally across the road from the airport. The room was very comfortable and we enjoyed a nice supper before retiring to bed. The flight the next day was 1200 from Krakow so a nice lie in and leisurely breakfast before we were in the skies heading to Dubai. This flight wasnt so comfortable sadly and I suffered terribly with nasal issues throughout 😷. It was quite a relief when we landed. Dubai certainly is a place it took 20mins just to get from the airplane to the airport in one of those shuttle buses! Finally we got connected with our taxi VIEW FROM RADISSON BLU DEIRA CREEK and we were soon on the way to our hotel - Radisson Blu Dubai Deira Creek.🏨 Once we were at the hotel a lengthy check in awaited but we were soon in our upgraded suite with superb views across the river. 💓🍴🌊 .Because of the time difference we were still awake and actually quite hungry despite the late hour so room service was ordered and tucked into before settling in for the night. Breakfast was included in our upgrade price and what a sight that was 💓 Everything you wanted was there and all was delicious. We came rolling out of breakfast and decided to do a bit of shopping before heading to the cruise terminal. We had a lovely stroll along the river and even had a random stranger take our picture for no recompense! Souvenirs and toiletries bought and we were soon in another taxi heading to the cruise terminal. Plan A of course was to try and get there via public transport but that was definitely not an option in Dubai sadly but thankfully taxis🚕 were a reasonable price. We were soon in the Cruise terminal and checked in ready to board THE JEWEL OF THE SEAS our ship - The Jewel of the Seas.🚢 We soon found our stateroom which was right at the front of the ship. The room was rather small and was very basic.😫...no sign of a kettle sadly so it was a good job I came prepared. The room was also quite dusty which was very disappointing but hey ho we got on with the task of unpacking before we got greeted by our cabin steward. Rather annoyingly he couldnt give us our wifi code so that would mean a trip to guest services and a 30min queue. The next job was the mandatory safety brief which was conducted in the main theatre of course we got lost but made it in the end. We decided on a proper look around the ship and its decks before dinner time as the ship set sail. As newbie cruisers we had no idea what to expect at dinnertime the only information we actually had was printed on our seapass - tides dining room 6pm we even had a table number assigned to us so off we went. To our horror our table was huge and it was obvious we were expected OUR CABIN to share with at least 10 other diners 😱. Not being very keen on this idea we spoke to the staff who as a favour sat us upstairs on a table for 2 however it was made clear that this would be a one off. Our table for 2 was literally a few inches away from 2 other couples so hardly intimate. The woman on my left constantly interrupted us but despite this annoying behaviour we did learn that there was a buffet style restaurant on the top deck which we could go to any time for meals. That seemed like a better plan for the rest of the week. Soon it was time to settle down the noise from the engine was shocking and it continued through the night on top of that the bed was quite hard so not much sleep was had that night 😩 The first port in our itinerary was a place called Sir Bani Yas Island in the UAE. We had been told through the ships daily publication that we had to report before 0930 in order to get a token to allow us to disembark and that these were on HELICOPTER RESCUE a first come first served basis. Given our lousy night we had slept in and really couldnt be bothered to get into an oversized dinghy in order to visit this island so a day on the ship it was. First stop was to try the buffet breakfast on the top deck which was a real treat in comparison to the previous night. Freedom to sit wherever and help ourselves. There was everything you could have wished for and we thoroughly enjoyed it💓 .The rest of the day was spent milling around the ship with a game of mini golf thrown in which of course I won. We also had the chance to witness a real airlift into a helicopter 🚁 from our room. That was also the day Andrew fell for the ships sales tactics and bought a rather expensive pair of insoles!💰. Dinner thankfully was also a better experience as we headed back up to the buffet. Better night sleep but only due to help from my trusty sleeping aids as I dont think the extra toppa supplied by the steward made that much difference.. The 2nd port was Doha in Qatar and we had arranged DOHA SKYLINE to go on the shuttle bus from the port to the centre 🚌. The shuttle bus was quite ridiculous - the first one went 100yards before dumping us at the cruise terminal building then onto the 2nd bus which dumped us in some car park which appeared to be the middle of nowhere. Thankfully with the help of google maps we were able to navigate ourselves in the right direction beating off the hoards of taxi touts along the way. 20 or so minutes later we were at the souk and desperately in need of a drink🍹. We had been advised to take US dollars as they were accepted everywhere - err no...but we did find a hotel where they took card payments and they advised us we could get actual cash in the souk. 2 orange juices later and we went off to explore the souk. The first part was jaw dropping birds tortoises and other pets everywhere😮 never seen so many in such a small area. Amazingly though there was no hassle anywhere and this continued throughout. We managed to find the ATM and did a bit of shopping. Andrew was rather obsessed by all the bling everywhere.💰 AT THE TOP OF THE MARRIOTT After lunch we decided it was time to try out the local metro🚇 and head downtown. The metro was amazing in itself totally immaculate and full of helpful english speaking staff. Our day ticket cost 6 QAR which worked out at just over a £1 so off we went. Getting off at the DECC stop the area was dominated by amazing skyscrapers and we decided that there must be a rooftop bar nearby so into the Marriott hotel 🌃. Sadly no rooftop bar but they did have a helipad 🚁and the amazing staff pulled a few strings so we could have a tour. The views from up there were outstanding and we were treated like VIPs throughout💓💓. The whole experience really made our day and we couldnt praise the staff enough especially since they didnt want any recompense and knew we werent actually staying at the hotel. When we finally came back down to earth it was a quick trip to the mall next door before heading back to the souk. Andrew had his eye on a model bus earlier but sadly they had closed before we got any actual cash so going on the siesta theory we decided to PARADE ON SHIP try again and this time it was open. They agreed on a price of 20 QAR but the seller was so pleased we had come back he gave us 5QAR back!! 😮! Certainly a scenario that was totally alien to us. The time in Qatar just flew by and it was soon time to get back on the ship just in time for dinner🍴 The next day we were just cruising at sea making our way back to Abu Dhabi. The sea was quite rough so we didnt really do much. Andrew managed to see some kind of parade celebrating the different nationalities on board whilst I rested in our cabin. Luckily by the evening things had calmed down a bit and we saw a show celebrating the musicals which was surprisingly really good.☺ The next stop was Abu Dhabi back in the UAE where we were going to spend 2 days because of the cancelled Bahrain trip. Having a few recommendations we first headed out to the Emirates Palace Presidential hotel 🏰 by taxi. It appeared that public transport was very limited so it was going to have to be taxis 🚕. Abu EMIRATES PALACE Dhabi was certainly vast and very impressive but not easy to get around on foot. Luckily though taxis were reasonable and the traffic was flowing well. We soon got to the Palace which like most places in the UAE was very impressive and grand. Andrew wasnt keen on the prospect of having to take out a second mortgage to buy drinks laced with real gold so we headed across the road into one of the hotels. Again no rooftop bar but they did point us in the direction of the Emirates Tower which was next door. This had a paid for observation deck with a restaurant so seemed ideal. The price wasnt way out and we enjoyed a nice lunch overlooking the whole of Abu Dhabi💓 .Then it was a walk to the mall which took longer than expected but we made it and actually managed to get the bits we needed before braving another walk heading this time to the beach area of Corniche. Sadly a wrong turn meant we actually walked further than expected and was getting quite anxious at the lack of taxis around. Finally we spotted one and headed straight back to the ship for a INSIDE THE GRAND MOSQUE much needed rest and some dinner.😫 The next day the Grand Mosque 🏰was top of the to do list so back in a taxi.🚕 The place was vast and very impressive not to mention very busy as you would expect. It took a long time to get to the actual building not to mention the rigmarole of having to put on a gown to make myself respectable! Snigger... I was suffering considerably in my joints after yesterdays unexpected walking so found the morning quite hard work but it was worth a visit to immerse yourself in all the opplunance of it all. Another recommendation was the Andaz Capital hotel which had made its way into the Guinness World Records for being the building with the largest tilt and at 18 its some tilt😮 so off we went to find some lunch.🍴 Again very impressive and the food wasnt bad but it wasnt cheap either but its nice to treat oneself whilst on holiday. Not wanting to risk another day like yesterday we decided it was safest to head back to the ship early following a quick stroll around the complex. Andrew also had his eye on some MIRACLE GARDEN bling at the port so it was time for some bartering before we set sail again.💰 We were now coming to the end of our cruise and had embarked back in Dubai. We had booked shore excursions for this day as we were aware beforehand that Dubai was a vast place with little in the way of public transport. The first one was to the Miracle Garden which I had seen previously on a facebook page must do travels. It was about a 45min coach trip to the outskirts of Dubai before we arrived. The whole place was very colourful and beautiful with lots of lovely things to see including the Dubai version of the Kelpies💓 .Thankfully it wasnt too busy and it was a nice relaxing way to spend a few hours. Andrew made friends with the local cats with the help of some of my ham sandwich and added to his bling collection so happy days.☺ Amazingly on the way back to the ship it started to rain -☔ apparently it only rained 12 days a year and guess what we saw it! Once we were back on the ship it was time to get BURJ KHALIFIA packed ready for our early departure the next day as we knew we had a late night planned. Soon it was 4.30 and time for our next excursion which we thought was a trip to the Burj Kalifia along with the other delights of Dubai. Well we definitely got that wrong as when we boarded the coach we were told the plan was to only go to the 3rd floor! What tour goes to the Worlds tallest skyscraper and only goes to the 3rd floor?? 😱 We were totally speechless but decided to carry on regardless. Once we got to the 3rd floor which by the way was on a rooftop in an annex bit not the actual tower the rain came down very heavy ☔so the views of the fountains etc were totally ruined. We thought at this stage that we werent going to come to Dubai and not go to the top of the Burj Kalifia so we exited the tour and headed to the queues of the actual tower 🌃. Amazingly we got through the queues quite quickly considering and we were soon at the top. At a cost of almost £160 for the pair of us VIEW FROM THE TOP 💰it wasnt exactly cheap but we felt it was necessary given where we were. The top was actually quite a small area and the glass was very reflective so it was hard to take any decent photos or indeed see past your own image so feeling disappointed we decided to head back down. Thankfully on our way one of the staff members mentioned the outside balcony which we soon headed to. Despite the rain and generally horrid weather conditions the views were outstanding💓and we were able to enjoy them much better without the reflections. The Burj Kalifia exited right into the Dubai Mall and again being the largest in the world we thought we would spend a bit of time there. However it soon became apparent this was not a nice relaxing place as even on a Sunday evening the place was at bulging point and we couldnt get out quick enough. It took us about 30mins to get down the taxi line in order to find a taxi 🚕to get back to the ship! It was quite a relief to get back and soon the alarm went off for our early flight to Bucharest.✈ The next BUCHAREST morning was rather a shambles. No means of getting any breakfast or indeed a cup of coffee.😩 The booked bus transfer left 20mins late which meant things werent as relaxed at the airport as they should have been. A delay getting breakfast didnt help the mood but certainly the time went very quickly and we were soon in the air. Thankfully this time we had come prepared with antihistamines and nasal sprays so it was a much better flight and we were soon in Bucharest. We were rather tired though and couldnt be bothered to navigate our way to the hotel through public transport so into another taxi. We did agree a fixed fee of 100lei as they didnt seem to like putting the meter on. Soon we had arrived at our hotel - Hilton Athenlee Palace 🏨which looked very plush and seemed to click all the boxes. We did wonder though what type of city Bucharest was as we had lots of recommendations for erotic massage and escorts but hardly any for places to eat!😮 Nevertheless we ventured out and had a wander around. It was very evident that despite the 5* hotels and Rolex shops the city was AT THE RAILWAY STATION! in dire need of some TLC. All the roads and pavements had serious safety issues hardly any of the escalators worked and the amount of graffiti was astounding 😱. On the plus side though the architecture was stunning though of course not used to their best potential. We did have a couple of orange juices in the ground floor bar of another hotel which had amazing views from the toilets of the top floor! Dinner consisted of a small buffet style in another hotel which filled the gap quite nicely. We only had one full day in Bucharest so thought we had better make the most of it. Andrew went out early to get breakfast 🍞so we were set up to go exploring. First stop - off to Gare du Nord. I knew Andrew would want to have a gander at some of the local trains🚄 and from a practical point of view i knew it would be an easy place to get about. The metro wasnt up to much and again in need of some TLC. not a patch on the one in Qatar sadly but yet cost more! But it did serve a purpose and TRAMS! we finally arrived at Gare Du Nord. Thankfully Andrew wasnt disappointed by the trains but the highlight was the poor worker manually changing all the train times balancing on the top of a ladder! My guess about the trams 🚊was also correct but didnt figure on things being so infrequent so a pit stop in KFC filled in the gap until the tram arrived. We then did have a lovely tram ride 🚊 to the next thing on the to do list - lounge 18 which apparently boasted the best views of the city. Lounge 18 was on the outskirts of town and did have great views but sadly the staff werent very accommodating so couldnt really sit in the best places and again the glass was quite reflective but hey ho we did have a nice latte ☕. Time was now ticking by and using public transport would have taken too long to get to our next stop so back in a taxi 🚕 and off to the Palace of Parliament 🏰 a huge communist palace now the home of Parliament. Taxis in Bucharest 🚕 are certainly not for the faint hearted as all of them think nothing of PALACE OF PARLIAMENT texting or reading something from google whilst speeding along. We did survive the trip and when faced with this huge yet impressive building we decided there was no way we would have the time to go inside so it was a quick few pictures before a walk along the river 🌊to the old town. The Old Town was nice to stroll around and do some shopping but again the infrastructure let the place down and surprisingly it wasnt a cheap place to go shopping. As it got dark it was decided the hotel was the best place for dinner so off we went ready for our early start back to Edinburgh ✈ The 0805 flight landed all on time and without incident and we were soon back in the reality that is home. « Previous Entry Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Ann-Marie chezwylde Welcome to my blog!

Every month this department organizes trips throughout the month where you can sign up for a fee and most are just a bus ride away. This trip was to the Fertility Festival in Komaki City which the description read that you had to be 18 and over and was one that you wouldnt forget. Not knowing what we were getting into that one sounded like a must do! After signing up though everyone kept saying Oh youre going to the penis festival and yes that it was! Just a brief description of the festival from their festival map Hounen-Matsuri the Bumper Harvest festival is well known as a unique festival. Villagers carry on their shoulders a Mikoshi portable shrine which bears an Ohowasegata phallus-shaped wooden sculpture. 60cm across 2m 13feet long and 620 pounds made of Hinoki Japanese cypress. They offer this huge phallus to Tagata Jinja praying for world peace the growth of all things and good harvest. We had to catch the Camp Zama tour bus at 5am Sunday and it took about 4 hours to get to the festival. Along the way fertilityfestival 033 we stopped at a rest stop that had vending machines that you can buy whatever you needed. I got my coffee and got to watch on a TV screen the process of my coffee being brewed how awesome! We got to the festival and just like a festival in the US you had all kinds of food souvenir and game vendors. The food though was so much more awesome though with octopus and cabbage balls squid on a stick octopus on a stick chicken gizzards on a stick etc etc. Even more interesting where all the goodies shaped as penises like candy chocolate covered bananas etc. The first offering of the parade to the Tagata Shrine was of the rice-cake. This was the first experience of the day that everyone at the parade gets free drinks of sake as many of you want by the people walking in the parade! Cant tell you how many cups of sake we had on this day and I actually like it because normally I dont care for sake. Rice cakes in Japan are not like the hard rice crispy looking treats that are in the US. They are like a dough that fertilityfestival 004 alot of times come filled with things like beef cabbage pork seafood etc so they are soft. This is a good thing since at the end of the festival they throw these rice cakes into a mosh pit crowd so that people catch them and is suppose to make women have babies. We made sure to stay away from that! LOL The offering of the portable phallus started around 2pm where there were thousands of people waiting to see this huge 620 pounds wooden shrine. The shrine was carried by several men and goodness did that phallus look heavy and huge! Along the way they still handed out more and more sake with jerky squid so good but what an awful after taste. So after we seen the large phallus this is where I lost my phone down the porta-jon. Yes this crap really does happen to me! For anyone that will come to visit Japan remember to start doing squats now and to never leave your phone in your back pocket. In Japan they still have toilets that are in the ground so you have to squat like you are going in the woods and western toilets fertilityfestival 038 are not always available. Have a new phone now so all is good but wasnt fun to watch my phone being sucked into the ground LOL This was a very long day and the bus picked us up at about 5pm and we headed back to Camp Zama. On the way we stopped for dinner at another rest stop and ordered our ramen dishes through a vending machines where the guys behind the counter cooked up our orders. Who wouldve ever thought you could get such good food through a vending machine! We reached home about 10pm and realized that as fun as that was we will not be doing these long trips on a Sunday when both of us have to get up at 5am the next day. This next weekend we should be headed out to Yokohama to the Ramen museum so until next week! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 19 Displayed 19 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Liz and Anthony Wilkes LAWilkes Travels We are an army family that moved to Japan and want to enjoy every moment of it.

It’s the only way to describe Jervis Bay! Being so close to Sydney and along the New South Wales coast line most people would assume that this tiny 102squared km piece of land is part of New South Wales but it isn’t. It is part of the ACT - Australian Capital Territory. When Canberra became the capitol in its own territory the Australian Government thought that every capital should have its own port and naval defence base that is why Jervis Bay is part of the ACT. Today it’s still used for Navy training but it is also a popular spot for tourists and locals alike and its easy to see why. White Sandy beaches one side surfing beaches the other and bush land with wild animals in between. When we first arrived at Jervis bay and got a map from the Tourist Office we were a little disappointed to see that some of the beaches required 4x4 vehicles and were not on accessible roads. We do not trust our van on anything other than accessible roads. However we needn’t have worried. We spent two full days in the Bay and went to many beaches. There were Scottish Rock Beach two main beaches that we went to. On the first day we spent all day at Cave Beach. This beach is named after two caves in the rock face. There was a little walk to the beach which was lovely through the bush where we got close enough to kangaroo’s to touch them! When we got to the beach we noticed straight away it was one of the surfer beaches. Lots of surfboards and sea kayaks. After finding a nice sandy spot we went straight in the sea. After swimming and catching waves we went and read for a while and ended up spending nearly all day at this beach. Before leaving we went and checked out the two caves unfortunately we didn’t find anything interesting in them! We could have paid to spend the night in one of the campsites in Jervis Bay but we had found a free site with a toilet not far away where we had spent the night before and decided to stay there again. Before heading back we went to Green Patch. A tiny carpark that leads on to a beach. We walked the entire beach then went through the trees and Footprints in the sand along the road back to the car we ended up doing a very big circle. We decided to get our chairs out of the van and go and sit on the beach. As soon as we sat down it started drizzling so we thought it best to go back to the campsite to sort dinner out before it rained too heavily! Luckily we were able to cook before the rain. However during the night I needed the bathroom and got soaking wet!    The next day we headed back to Jervis Bay and went straight to Murrays Beach. This beach was amazing no waves crystal clear water and very white sand. I used my snorkel and went swimming. There weren’t a lot of fish but I did see some. We spent most of the day at this beach swimming and reading. At one point we noticed a lot of people gathering at the edge of the water. A Sting Ray had appeared in the bay and was swimming along where we had been not that long ago. We wanted to see the other points of interest before leaving Jervis Bay so after leaving Murrays Beach we drove to a lay-by He touched one and walked to A Hole in the Wall. This is a small beach where there is a rock with a hole in it. The beach was a short walk through the trees which was lovely.   After this beach we drove again for a bit until another lay-by where we saw the Scottish Rocks. We don’t really understand the name of this place. It was another beach through another lovely walk and yes there were Rocks but I’m not sure what makes them Scottish. Our last stop in Jervis Bay was Bristol Point. This is one of the camping stops but we didn’t camp. We visited the beach there but with the tide in there wasn’t much to see. We then snuck in to the campsite and used their showering facilities. The water was a lovely temperature and we were both very glad we had the opportunity to shower - albeit cheekily! There really is no way to describe the beauty of Jervis Bay but if you ever get the chance – GO « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 11 Displayed 11 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message Charlotte Englishabroad Hi and welcome to my blog 😊 Im a girl in her mid twenties who has always loved traveling and learning things about a new country.

Apparently it is the oldest standing castle in Japan. The other National Treasure castles are Hikone Himeji see previous blogs and Matsumoto see a future one but not yet!. To get there I had to take 3 trains again but I was glad that one of them was a shinkansen to Nagoya – the bullet trains are awesome. Eventually I arrived at Unuma station which is across the river from Inuyama. Again there is a private railway that can get you closer but it wasn’t far away and as it turns out it was a very nice walk. Crossing the bridge over the river gave a wonderful vista of the castle on the hill and on the other side the riverside walk was really nice. Despite looking like quite a large hill the walk up was surprisingly not too bad. Once again they had entrance ticket combos and I had no idea what else I wanted to see in town because I hadn’t found the tourist information office yet. So I went for the Watching Where Were Going Some of the trains here allow you to look out the front which I really like. combo that included the nearby tea garden. The castle itself is pretty nice but not huge. There also wasn’t much of a ground around the castle mostly because it’s on the edge of a cliff. I headed into the castle and had a look around. There wasn’t a lot inside but they did have the lord’s room to show what it was like inside the actual castle when it was in use. There were a few displays some armour and other things but no English signs so I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. The highlight once again was the view from the top. The castle actually had a veranda around the top floor. Then I headed back down via the extremely steep staircases – I don’t know how a samurai would have done it in full armour! After a brief stop for souvenirs and an ice-cream I left the castle to have a look around town. I quickly found the tourist information centre and tried to ask them what was in the Shirotomachi museum. Unfortunately their English was only marginally better than my Japanese so they kept telling me how to get Riverside Walk On the way to Inuyama Castle there. Anyway I had plenty of time so I decided to go and check it out regardless. As it turns out it was only 100 yen so there wasn’t much to lose. There wasn’t a lot in there but it was quite well done. The main room was dominated by a massive model of the town as it was hundreds of years ago. It was quite detailed and very impressive. There were two additional rooms with various items displayed including armour and swords. Two of the swords were really big – possibly equivalent to a Scottish claymore end to end although these swords had longer handles. The museum ticket also gave me entrance to the Karakuri Exhibition room across the road. I thought it was just some kind of puppet museum at first. But there was a tour group getting a talk and demonstration so I eavesdropped on the English translator and it turns out that Karakuri are mechanical puppets that were used to deliver tea. It was quite clever really because the puppet stops moving once somebody picks up the teacup. When the teacup is replaced it starts moving again turning around in Looking Up at Inuyama Castle a semi-circle and heading back to where it came from. Apparently it was designed to move exactly the length of a standard mat. From there I headed back down the hill and went to the Uraku-En tea garden. The tea room there was actually built for a brother of Oda Nobunaga the first person to unify Japan during the Sengoku Jidai civil war who was a master of the tea ceremony this was actually a really big deal in Feudal Japan – the tea ceremony was often participated in but rarely mastered. It has actually been moved to the Uraku-En garden. The garden was lovely though and the highlight for me. It was getting about time for me to start heading back to the train station. I walked back and had the chance to look at some of the fighter jets that had been flying over all day. I recognised F-4s and F-15s. I assumed earlier that there must have been an air force base nearby or something. But on the walk back to the station I could see that they were flying one at a time over to the west dropping low very On The Way to Inuyama Castle low and circling around a couple of times before leaving. I thought I saw some smoke rising in that direction so perhaps there’s a live bombing range there somewhere. The trip back to Kyoto was uneventful other than the fact that I was on a train that actually left late! Sure it was only 4 minutes and it was only 2 minutes late when it got to Nagoya but that is by far the latest I’ve seen any train run in Japan. Tomorrow is a bit of a rest day. I will be getting my luggage forwarded to my hotel in Takamatsu a great service available here in Japan! so all I have to do is catch a couple of trains. Takamatsu will be my base for a week while I explore the small island of Shikoku with a trip back to Honshu to visit Hiroshima thrown in for good measure. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 24 Displayed 24 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 15 Message David Vincent deejayvee I am from Sydney Australia.

No Worries Mate! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Albury October 7th 2010 Published October 10th 2010Edit Blog Post Pootling Possums How can we leave this lovely spot? Sunday morning came and we had decided it was time to get on the road although it would be easy to stay longer in such a wonderful spot. We took our time getting everything ready there’s quite a lot of preparation to be done - everything has to be found a secure home so it won’t escape when we’re travelling along. The roof has to go down the electric cable disconnected and put away and the car hitched up correctly including the electrics for the lights indicators etc. Graham has a pretty good sense of how he should reverse the car up to the caravan but I needed to guide him a bit which I just about managed OK!. Come 11.30 and we were all ready. We said our goodbyes to the fantastic Reeves family and Spotty the dog and set off. We had changed our minds a few times about where our first destination would be but we finally decided to go to Albury for a few reasons it wasn’t too far about 200 kms it is a biggish town and it was in the right direction for our on-going plans. Because we were able to travel on the motorway for this town site? it didn’t take too long to get to Albury but finding the caravan park was a different matter. We knew the park was in an area of Albury called Lavington but Sat Nav didn’t recognize Wagga Road and it’s not too pleasant feeling lost when towing a caravan for the first time. We had to ring the park to get directions and discovered that Wagga Road is better known as the Hume Highway so why not put that on the directions for the park?? We got there eventually and got a bit of a discount because it is a Top Tourist park and we are RACV members. It wasn’t the sort of park we would normally go for because it was mostly cabins and it was very urban. Still Graham did a fantastic job reversing Sweetie into the pitch. We were right next to the camp kitchen and loos which seemed a bit of a bonus. Monday 4th October was a bank holiday in NSW Labour Day so we feared the shops might not be open. Some weren’t but most of the big stores were of course. We headed into Albury and found a K-mart where we bought some Great bbq job by Graham of the essentials to us anyway! for our trip an electric kettle a toaster a washing up bowl small drinking glasses etc etc. Conveniently we had parked the car next to a camping shop so we went in to see what they had and came out with a light-weight table for outside use. While we were in Albury we visited the information centre which is located by the railway station - a truly splendid old building. As usual the lady in there was very helpful and we came out thinking we would need to spend a few weeks in this area to do it justice! But we spent the rest of the day sorting through boxes and re-organising the caravan so that the things we needed most were close to hand. That evening for the first time on this trip Graham used an Aussie BBQ and cooked some chicken in the camp kitchen. I was able to cook the veggies on the camp kitchen hobs and it all worked very well - we had a delicious meal with no cooking costs. We thought we should explore the area a little so on Tuesday morning we drove to Hume Dam Albury Railway Station which holds the main water supply for the area. The reservoir is pretty full at the moment but no water was being released through the dam gates. The lady in the Visitor Centre said it was a pretty spectacular sight when this happens - maybe next time. Back in 1952 when the dam was built the decision was made to relocate a small town - Tallangata. Then there were about 400 inhabitants. We visited The Town That Had To Move” in it’s new location which was about 7kms away from the original place and it was very pleasant. Many of the wooden houses were transported complete but all brick built buildings were demolished and new ones erected. We had lunch in the new town which has grown considerably and read all about the re-location in the visitor centre. We drove up to the local lookout that had fantastic views of the town and reservoir. We then drove back via Wodonga couldn’t find their advertised lookout but managed to find the one in Albury which was also a War Memorial Park and a lovely tranquil place. We had intended to go on to a wetlands area but a little problem with The Murray River flows through the lake the left indicator arose and we felt that needed sorting. The hazard lights had also stopped working a few days earlier so we popped into a garage near the caravan park and within a few minutes a helpful mechanic had checked the fuses changed a faulty one and sent us on our way with everything working again. ‘No worries mate’ was the cheery response when we asked how much the cost was but we gave him some beer money anyway. Since we had come back to the park earlier than planned Graham had a swim in the pool cold but very refreshing while I did yet more re-organising. We had been toying with the idea of staying another night but decided against it for various reasons and so the following morning we got on the road to Narrandera. Narrandera was the scene of our first breakdown but as it is a very pleasant town we thought it was worth another look. We headed for the caravan park which we had walked through on our previous visit. It’s right on Lake Talbot and close to the area where we had seen the Koala. We had booked ahead for two nights. Impressive wall of the dam It was another ‘Top Tourist’ park but unlike Albury the lady in reception wasn’t happy about giving us a discount simply because we are RACV members. It only costs $30 to join the ‘Top Tourist’ club so we thought we might as well as we would soon get our money’s worth in discounts. Also as it is a two year membership who knows Sarah and Darryl might be able to make use of it. The pitches were ‘drive through’ which makes life much easier for Graham and we had a good choice so we settled on one overlooking the lake. A very chatty couple set up next door and we thought everything was right for the night. At about 4.30 that afternoon ‘Col’ next door said he thought it was going to rain and reckoned it would be in the next half hour - a bold prediction since there was bright sunshine and endless blue skies. Graham went off to have a shower at 5 o’clock and he hadn’t been gone long when Col came over and pointed to a large black cloud which had suddenly appeared and suggested we put our awning away. All of a sudden a pleasant Moving a house was a tricky task! afternoon changed to quite a frightening one - the heavens opened and a gale force wind was swirling around and some of the things we had left outside were blowing away. I wasn’t too sure how to get the awning down but it was in danger of taking off. Very fortunately Pat Col’s wife was there to help. We got it down in the nick of time and I managed to get some stuff in the back of the car with the help of another camper. By the time Graham wandered back to the caravan although it was raining a bit the wind had dropped and he wondered what all the fuss was about. Pat and Col probably saved our awning so we are very grateful to them. We had just got inside the van when Graham spotted on the inside of the door the biggest spider we have ever seen. Graham reacted very quickly thankfully and got it outside although it did seem to like the idea of coming back inside. Eventually he got it to go in another direction and it disappeared. Col said it was a ‘Huntsman’ spider and not harmful. It was as big as my Steady as she goes! hand with great long crab-like legs and I don’t especially want to see another one!! Where did it come from? - we shall never know! We didn’t sleep too well that night what with thinking about spiders and awnings but no harm seemed to have been done. Thursday morning came and we got the bikes out! Having carted them around for six weeks and hardly used them we knew today would be a good opportunity to test them out. We wanted to go back to where we had seen the Koala but the gate to the track we had walked along on our previous visit had a ‘Road Closed’ sign across it. We wondered why and cycled on only to discover that the track was badly flooded. The river Murrumbidgee had burst its banks a few weeks earlier and there was still a lot of lying water. That was disappointing but it didn’t matter too much as along the riverbank was another track so we cycled along there for a good few kilometers. We saw quite a few birds but no koalas. There are plenty of wild flowers out at the moment and this area has lots of Darling Views down to Tallangatta Peas which are pretty purple flowers. After that we cycled into town went to the information centre and also had a look at the Tiger Moth” memorial to the wartime flying school which used to be in the town. We had lunch and then cycled to the wetlands which was just outside town and had a pleasant wander round spying a harrier herons egrets and lots of small birds. The wetland is only a couple of years old so will develop and grow as the years go by. We had made good use of our bikes today with no problems so maybe they will be useful after all. There was no storm tonight thank goodness so we got a good night’s sleep. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 18 Displayed 18 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message Jan and Graham Pootling Possums Hi and welcome to our blog.

I was extremely ready to move here from Beer Sheva and to see what is too come. We moved here Jan 4th and had a week of touring our different volunteer places. My schedule got switched a bunch of times and this is the final version. I am working in a kindergarten and a couple matnasim. In the afternoon in one I work with an after school program for kids with special needs and then the evening with at risk teens. The other night that I work is an evening program for kids with special needs and then lastly I work at an after school program called a tzharon for kids to have a place to go when the finish school at 1230. I started volunteering the first week and it was very hard to get into a routine because I went from not really volunteering in B7 to a full schedule. The one plus is that when I do have free time I can use my gym membership that I got. I Joined the country club which is down the street from my apt it is so nice. The coordinator seems nice but we flowers will see what happens it seems like she is out of it a lot of the time. I also am counting down the days to my cousins bat mitzvah because I get to see my entire family including my mom. I have started to feel like i need a break from the people I live with. They are great we cook for each other and what not but I think that I am deff the third wheel in this picture and I dont like that feeling. I have given my volunteer places the chances they deserve and a couple of them I just really dont like. I dont feel like I am connecting with the kids or just enjoying what I am doing. Everyone else in Rehovot absolutely love thier places so the people I live with just think I am not giving what I need to to the places which is just not true. Iit is already Febuary 21st and we leave March 31st. So if I switch now the other places will just not get the full of my experience here. I now learned that I really shouldnt wait and that if I decide to wait and flowers 2 give it a try then really speak up. But now there is nothing I can do and I will ust make the best of it. One weeknd in the end of january the new york federation included the eight otzmanikim on the trip. We had cocktails with Nir Barkat new appointed mayor of jlem and then were able to hear some of the speakers of the first day of the mission. It was very cool. We were able to meet people and tell our stories. I actually met this guy who has his own business with photography and it is called through the lens and it is in Jewish schools in the states as well in Israel primarily it was piloted in Rehovot. Once I heard that I knew I would be interested in working with kids doing that project especially since it was the age group I asked for. Elementary 4th grade. Once I brought this idea to my coordinator she basially said I need to stay where she put me. I was a little bummed but I saw that being her answer. The first thing that ran through my mind was the saying that is constantly repeated idan Otzma is what you make of it.. Here I am trying to make it what I want and every time I get shut down. I have never been a person to count down days til something is over but that is how I honestly feel here and I shouldnt because on teh weekends when it is my time I am thoroughly enjoying the trip and people I meet. I volunteered for the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and I was able to hear Ehud Olmert Tzipi Livni and Bibi Netanyahu three very important people right now. I heard them speak right after elections and during a period of time that the coalitions were being formed. I also got to spend a little time with my aunt and that was a plus and I thanked her for the opportunity I was able to get by her inviting me to the dinners and such. I have decided I will give my time to my volunteer places when I have to which is sunday through thursday and I will do what I want on my mornings off as well as my weekends. It is so nice that I idan 2 have sunday morning off and that my weekend is extended by twelve hours and it makes a huge difference. TX and I are going to IDC to check it out for ourselves I am quite excited a little nervous and not sure what to expect but I am going there with an open mind. It is called International Disciplinary Center - Raphael Recanati International school. They have a handful of majors a couple I am interested I would live in Israel for three years and study in English which is a huge thing. People come all over to study at IDC and it might just be the place for me to repave the road for me of a healthy academic environment. The area of study that I think I am interested in what they offer is Government Diplomacy and Strategy. It is very intense the course selection but I think it will be very stimulating especially learning it from professors who grew up in Israel as well as who live within the current political situation here. I have been talking about this school for a very long time. I have friends who are studying here from USY RAMAH as well idan 3 as NYC. They are prob about done with their degree here since its only three years. But from what I heard they have loved it every single moment. The school schedule is very different its not like the American system where its AUG-MAY its more like OCT-JUL. This is because of all the Jewish Holidays so they dont want to have to start and stop school over and over again almost every week in the months of September. It is very smart and I would be able to go home for pesach and the summer. I am very excited I have someone coming with me so that TX can see and help me evaluate if this is the place for me. Low and behold I am having a rocky time in rehovot but it is almost done and I can not wait. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 25 Displayed 25 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Tanya Singer twopointtanya Taking a year off from school moved to Israel to volunteer and explore and travel... full info Joined February 8th 2009 Trips 1 Last Login August 31st 2009 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 28 Guestbook 1 Photos 276 Forum Posts 0 blog=375536 blogger=109686 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=375536 blogger=109686 Advertisement Brief history of Israel Following World War II the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states an arrangement rejected by the Arabs.

Very unfortunate as we had to leave our hostel aty 5am to get the first train out of bangkok to the border town of Aranyaprathet. It was an exciting start to the day and we were shocked how the city really doesnt sleep. Teams of people were flooding off the sleeper train to start work in the capital. Anyway we found our 3rd class train at a cost of 80p each and we settled in for our 6 hr journey. It was a good move getting the train not only for the price but the amasing views and the close proximity to ordinary Thai folk. We breakfasted on the train from the fresh food sellers walking up and down the carridges - beats uk fast food any day. At our destination we embarked on the unknown path to the border. Doged by touts we managed to survive their scams up unto the boarder control itself but not with out a lot of harrasement! A helpful gentleman showed us where to go at each point in the crossing process. Hoho but we were fooled. Some other hippy travellers were negotiating the same route and we followed along ignorantly. Eventually wee reached the Cambodian town of Poipet. A sight for sore eyes certainly. Men missing legs and small malnurshied children were plentiful. At this point we were having second thought about our 2nd country of choice. Well teh debarcle continued when this helpful man took us all to a bank well his brothers shop. Eventually we managed to extract ourseleves from this dodgy situation by getting a taxis all the way to Siem Reap - our destination town. We were meant to share this with some hippes to save on cost but what a surprise they let us down when they found others to share their dope stories with. We did not know what was ahead of us. Our driver could speak little english and the surrounding town was noteably damaged by artilary attack - not plesant viewing. We continued and endured the worst road in Asia - 3.5 hrs of huge holes and untarmached roads. Helpfully i needed a wee four minutes into our journey and had to hold it to the point of burstiong and that is not an exageration. We asked to stop but of course we had to go tp his friends house another 1hrs drive - then we were charged 5 baht for the privaledge of going down a hole! Eventually we arrived in the town but the story did not end there. Suddenly we were dumped at a taxis rank and told a story that no taxis were allowed in the town - more lies we scence. At this point our paitence is running out and we insists to be taken straight to our hotel of choice and not their uncles house! Stupidly I realise I left my camera in the taxis and we have to stop. Luckily our driver rings the taxis man and my camera was safely returned. At that point did we realise that Siem Reap might not be as bad as Bangkok or Poipet. We get taken to our hotel which is divine but the driver insists on returning tomorrow to give us a guided tour of the temples. What defence did we have after them helping us out?? We agreed for then to come back the next day and we enjoyed the relative serene and tranquility of our new surroundings until the next day.

We survived the 15 hour flight to Sydney and it wasnt that bad. Its definately better travelling with kids in many ways because you dont get so bored on these long flights. In fact its just like a normal day of feeding and trying to get them to sleep! The time seemed to go past quite quickly. It was the first flight I have ever gone without any sleep. Amelia and Samuel seemed to play tag team so that when one was asleep the other woke up. Samuel hardly slept at all to be honest. I dont want to go on about it too much but I cant get over how good the kids were. They really rose to the occasion. We didnt have one tantrum from Mimi. A few moments of being over tired but nothing that a cuddle couldnt resolve. She just did as she was told and loved the whole experience. Samuel was his usual chilled self and just ate lots and took it all in. Slept when he needed to sleep. It was so much easier than with a 6m old Amelia...great not to be breastfeeding. One word of advice for anyone traveling Etihad. Looks uncomfortable but she slept like this for 4 hours. The kids entertainment went down a treat but Winnie the Pooh should not be confused with I need a poo 30 secs before take off. We had to get a flight attendant to open the toilet for us rush her in only to be asked daddy what are we doing in here? No poo poo today. Im not convinced that medised worked for us. It seemed to wake Samuel up even more and sleep for shorter time. Etihad get the thumbs up from me for the food and service. In fact Abu Dabi generally gets the thumbs up. Good playground for the kids at the airport always a bonus. When we got to Sydney we had quite a mission getting our baggage and out through biosecurity but only because an A380 had landed at the same time so there were shed loads of people all arriving together. Our taxi driver from the airport more than made up for that. He was so friendly. Even gave us a DVD for Amelia and a discount! We did declare the fact that we had been on a farm in the past 30 days and thankfully they took it on Samuel only just fitted into the bassinet trust that I had scrubbed my shoes. I dont think well mention it in New Zealand as well be rriving late and it will add a delay. Naughty I know but I have taken a lot of care to clean everything. We are staying in Watsons Bay which is lovely. Good to catch up with Sarah the night before her big day. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 4 Displayed 4 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Fi Roberts FiRoberts I thought marrying a Kiwi was going to mean lots of exciting trips around the world...and it did kind of...but as I look ahead our impending adventure from Worcester to Wellington with two kids in tow I am wondering what on earth I got myself into!... full info Joined February 20th 2012 Trips 0 Last Login April 4th 2017 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 12 Guestbook 0 Photos 48 Forum Posts 0 blog=692820 blogger=230688 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=692820 blogger=230688 Advertisement Hows about that?

Kate arrived this morning after her overnight bus trip ready to go on our Montserrat Tapas & Wine Tasting tour. This started in Plaza Catalunya where we met our guide for the day - Xavi and the rest of our group including Justin from Chigago! Then a bus ride to Monistrol about an hour north west from Barcelona with interesting commentary along the way we were told that we were on the 1/2 day tour 10 to 5.30 as opposed to the full day tour 10 to 7.30?? where we caught the cogwheel train up the mountain to Montserrat. I chose a tour that included the train as a friend from work had told me how good it was - she failed to mention that the train goes up the side of a cliff!! Spectacular views on the 15 minute journey. Xavi then gave us a guided tour of the Montserrat site including the Monastery famous for the Black Madonna and its surrounds. Also includied was a tasting of the liqueur made on site by the nuns not the monks apparently. There were 4 to taste - mixed herbs very ordinary but Kate & View from the train Can see the snow capped Pyrenees in the background Maurice liked it walnut I thought this one was nice hazelnut and cream the last one was a bit like Baileys and also nice. Then some sweet bread like foccacia with sugar on top to soak up the alcohol! We passed the queue to touch the Black Madonna on the way into the abbey and then Xavi was keen to point out inside the abbey the chandelier that had been donated by FC Barcelona. Then as Xavi was keen to point out we had a whole hour of free time. Maurice and Kate chose to walk to the Cross of San Miguel which we had seen when we got off the train 20 mins each way. I decided to check out the farmers market locally produced cheese mostly goat and honey. Then made my way back to the abbey to hear the choir sing at 1pm Maurice & Kate made it in time as well. The boys choir LEscolania - one of the oldest in Europe were very good. Then the bus took us to Oller Del Mas an organic winery in Manresa north of Montserrat for a winery tour and tasting. There was still small amounts of Cross Looking at the cross from outside the Abbey snow on the side of the road as we went down the mountain. The winery is housed in a restored 10th century castle and we first had cheese and wine outside this was my favourite wine - made from Picapolls grapes - apparently a regional specialty. Then through the winery up and down lots of stairs - always my favourite to our Tapas and Tasting. Tapas were nice 4 savoury 1 sweet wine not so nice 1 white 2 red but a fun time with Xavi educating and amusing us the whole time. Back in Barcelona by 5.30pm - because it was the 1/2 day tour we headed for Placa Reial for dinner but not till 8.30pm because apparently lunch in Spain is 2-5pm and dinner not till after 9pm. Maurice had discovered this square with lots of restaurants and cafes on his morning search for coffee he discovered not much opens till 10am. We chose an Italian restaurant so dinner was tapas paella and sangria - made perfect sense! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Lyn Ljeread Joined February 16th 2018 Trips 3 Last Login December 15th 2019 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 61 Guestbook 2 Photos 827 Forum Posts 0 blog=1012303 blogger=381121 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1012303 blogger=381121 Advertisement Trips Visiting Kate March 21st 2018 -» April 15th 2018 Canada/US June 6th 2018 -» June 28th 2018 Africa!!

Orientation – Finding a location of significance was easy. Many could either be seen or had signage directing you to them from almost anywhere in the city. Good for tourism. However if you needed groceries or fuel this was another matter. Culture - The National Art Gallery – Not only was the Building housing the National Gallery of Australia awesome it was great to see some artistic icons such as Blue Poles and some more contemporary pieces such as Pumpkins and Black dots. Democracy - Parliament House – The last time we visited Canberra New Parliament House was still under construction. A truly magnificent piece of architecture with so much thought and planning giving significance to almost every aspect of the building. Orientation - Views and vistas colours artworks furniture size and shape of spaces and their uses courtyards and their landscaping you name it there was an explanation for why it was done this way. While the public could wander around public areas we opted for a Behind the Scenes tour. This was well worth it. A small peep hole into the cube revealed more mirror tricks We saw and we learnt even though we still couldn’t enter the Houses as they were not in session we could peek through the doors which is more than we could have otherwise done. Law and Order - The High Court of Australia – Again an impressive piece of Architecture. The same era as The National Gallery – so essentially sculptured concrete perhaps not to everyone’s taste. No courts were in session but tour guides at each of the courts were happy to have a chat and show us around. As a result we both have a much better understanding of the purpose of this court and how it works. Currency - The Royal Mint - Money money money. The history of the Australian monetary system proved much more complex than we realised. Lots of examples of rare coins fakes and flawed coins. The original Mr Squiggle and friends was a current feature. Little kids were fascinated but the reaction of many adults who grew up watching Mr Squiggle was possibly more interesting. Unfortunately it was Saturday so there was little more to see than the static displays. History - The National War Memorial Greg and Blue Poles – So much to see and learn here. We visited twice and still didn’t see everything. It’s one of those places that can be a little confronting. It is enormous with so many exhibits from artefacts dioramas films displays models interactives and static displays. There were things to capture the attention of every age group. Like Parliament House this was a popular venue for school groups. Looking at those in attendance we were also intrigued by the diversity of the people their cultural background ages and high level of engagement. There is certainly a lot more for us to see here in the future. Nature - Fauna in the caravan park. Obviously people feed the birds and animal and this encourages them to come in close and personal. This can be entertaining until they poop steal or become aggressive. Large bright red parrots are common here and if they thought they would get a treat from you they would hang around until a better offer came along. Similarly magpies in the Parliament House courtyard café seem to think serenading patrons is a good way to get a feed. They are probably right most of the time. Even a A garden of digeridoos possum was almost wooed by Greg as he wandered after dark. Indulgence - We managed to score a waterfront table for lunch at the Yacht Club. It was a beautiful weekend day so many families and groups were taking advantage of the perfect weather to dine in or picnic on the lawns at the Sailing Club. Again beautiful seafood! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 25 Displayed 24 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Where_is_Friday_Lunch?

A trip up to Diba in Fujairah to do some scuba diving and geocaching. It all began with a long drive after I finished work passing through Sharjah and standstill traffic. Once I got through this I was off foot down on the open roads passing through the desert. As usual sign posts slowly faded away and I was constantly questioning myself if I was going the right way. Fortunately I was and I didn’t end up geographically unaware or even worst lodging with a goat for the night. As with driving to Hatta the landscape changes quickly and the mountains spring out of the ground engulfing small villages and farms. I had to pull over at one point and take a couple of pictures but If I had my way it would of taken me 5 hours to get there instead of 2 with all the photo opportunities. Finally I reached Diba which is a small town right on the coast sandwiched between the sea and the mountains which were literally across the road. I passed by the harbour in search of my hotel and I immediately spot The lair a geocache location from my map but I decided to check in first and come back later. After check in I got changed and got out the geocaching kit which included a head torch as it was getting dark. This didn’t deter me and I made for the location I spotted earlier. After quick 5 minute drive and a U-turn I pulled up on the dirt track and decided the stang should stay put and got out the pack and head torch. It was pretty dark by now but it made it all the more enjoyable especially with the scenery around me. As I got further in the sounds of passing vehicles faded away and it was just me and the mountains. I started my scramble up looking carefully to make sure there were no bears/tigers/predators the alien kind/general carnivorous animals lying in wait. Eventually I got to the top but before I began looking I sat down and took in the views and enjoyed the quiet. 10 minutes later and the cache was still not in sight and my GPS was saying I was right on top of it. Then under a small bush I spotted a large opening Find number 5 in the rocks which was where I discovered the lair. After shining my head torch in and got over the initial thought that I had spotted a spider the size of a small child really small I had discovered it was a dead bird that had been violently eaten with feathers everywhere. I thought surely the cache can’t be in here it was. I pulled away the rocks and there it was reaching in I pulled out a small container uncovering some minor creepy crawlies. At least the man eating spider wasn’t home he was probably out hunting a deer or something. Anyway I logged the find and took out a green army man and replaced it with a badge of the late Sheikh Zayed. I took some photos sat down again well away from the lair of course and then made my way back to the stang. Next on the list was a cache just by a roundabout with a shark statue on it. The roundabout was easy to find the cache however was not. I pulled onto another dirt track and was looking for a small cairn pile of rocks as I shone my headtorch around I View from the top noticed one thing there were a lot of rocks. The GPS took me to the foot of a tree which fitted the description but there were no cairns around. So I broadened the search and spotted the cairn in question slightly off from the coordinates. Even though it was next to a roundabout it was still very quiet so I could take my time taking photos. I took out a bungee cord which looked useful and replaced it with a dominoes set then onto the next one. By now it was about 10.30pm and the roads were dead and the mountains were just big black splodges touching the sky. Again the terrain ahead wasn’t suitable for the stang so he had to watch from the sidelines. There I was looking for a small tree about halfway up the mountain when my head torch revealed loads of shiny ‘objects’ all over the rocks. I went to investigate to find spiders with what could be described as a sequin type object on their body shining when light was brought over it. No word of a lie there were hundreds of them all over the place it was immense. After making my The cairn way up the rocks and watching little bits of light scurrying all over the place I came to the cache site. I let a little scorpion rush past before checking out a man-made looking rock pile to reveal the cache one of the largest I had found. I took the usual photos took in the surroundings and made haste back to the car before the spiders realised they could gang up on me and take me down. I retreated back to my hotel room ending my first night one of the best ever and I hadn’t even started diving! Day 2 and it was an early start to get to the dive centre which was tucked in next to a beach resort with a view of Diba rock. I spent the day learning skills in the pool which included mask clearance and experiencing the ‘out of air’ feeling underwater. It was a long day but worth it when I got to do our first sea dive. I got all my gear prepped and swam out to the boat in the nice warm sea ready to take us out to the rock. A quick boat ride and I was at Find number 6 the rock ready to dive. One last check of the gear and I rolled off the boat into the sea. After a few surface drills I went under with my instructor and another diver and was taken aback by the vast amount of life under the water. I saw turtles scratching themselves on the coral lionfish scorpion fish and reef sharks to name but a few. I practiced some of the skills that I had learnt in the pool including the emergency ascent where you run out of air and have to surface whilst breathing out really slowly. Then we spent the rest of the dive taking in the sights before surfacing for pick up a great first dive. Unfortunately it was straight back to the pool where we stayed until around 8pm a very long day but well worth it. Even more so as the instructors invited me to stay for some beers and BBQ on the beach this was awesome. We just chilled out and talked about random stuff and some good dive sites to visit it was nice and relaxed. 11pm came and it was time for me to go to bed another full day of diving Al Aqah roundabout ahead and unfortunately it left me no time to get the final 2 geocaches I wanted from this trip. Ahh well I will be back up again very soon. The final day and another early rise all our dives were in the sea this time and less skills to perform giving more time for pleasure. I did 3 more dives in total each one better than the last and I always spotted something different. I surfaced for the last time and was pretty tired by this point. I cleaned all my gear and packed it away but before I could relax I had to do a 200m swim in the sea to finish the course. A great end to a great weekend and I will definitely be returning soon to do the advanced course and some more dives at another location. All that was left to do was to say goodbye to the guys and hit the road back to Dubai. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Lee Bradbury bradb86 Ive been very lucky to get a job working in Dubai so ill be documenting my experience here.

It was a desolate sort of building that gave off a haunted house vibe located atop an isolated hill. Wakkanai was still being deluged by buckets of rain and after a while I began to feel somewhat trapped the early stages of cabin fever were imminent. I walked around the empty hostel in an attempt to keep myself busy but there was no one else around. Reception was only open for a couple of hours each day and the elderly gentleman receptionist mostly appeared to be interested in staring at the wall. Each morning I would awake and pull back the curtains to expose the watery world of Wakkanai. Then I’d let out a heavy sigh before trudging downstairs to reception to book yet another night in the house that time forgot. The receptionist would also sigh in disgust at my request and thus the cycle continued. One would have thought that my saving grace would have been the television in my room yet unfortunately this would only add to my misery as it allowed me to bear witness to World Cup Fever on the little screen the tragedy of England’s offensively disgraceful World Cup campaign and the less said about that sham the better. Wakkanai - Shosanbetsu 74 miles On my fourth day there a heavier than normal sigh ensued as I skulked downstairs to reception. ‘Ohayo gozaimasu’ good morning I said to the receptionist who seemed a little disgruntled by the fact that I’d just disturbed his reverie of boredom. ‘Oh... Ohayo gozaimasu’ he begrudgingly replied. ‘Mou hitoban onegai shimasu’ one more night please. ‘Ano… chotto...’ hmm… erm…well. He was being hesitant about something. ‘Oh mondai desu ka?’ Oh is there a problem? The receptionist then went on to tell me that the hostel was full. ‘What??’ I said in English the word echoing down the baron hallway and it probably still is. I then took a good look around me making a point to observe one of the building’s main proficiencies… its sheer emptiness. ‘Honto ni?’ Seriously?I said marginally miffed. ‘Hai sou desu gomen ne’ Yes that’s right sorry about that. Before going on to confirm that check out was at 10am. I looked at my watch it was 950am. I Shosanbetsu sighed so hard I almost destroyed myself. 11 minutes later and I was reaquainted with a classic drenching as I began to work my way south on the long road towards Okinawa. Although despite the damp conditions there was a certain jubilance about being back on the road again. The act of being just ever so slightly more productive than being sat on one’s arse in a crummy hostel room was one of pure invigoration. I was reaping the positives from the negatives. Yes it was pissing it down but I was back in the saddle and more importantly I was happy to be there! After a couple of hours I came across an unmanned road side rest area. It was a small wooden structure immaculately clean offering toilets cooking facilities a dining area and an enticingly huge gas heater. It was open to the weary traveller in a gesture of goodwill and trust a true pyromaniac’s paradise. Feeling the increasing need to take all my clothes off I stripped away my seemingly non-waterproof waterproofs. Firing up the gas heater I began to dry my belongings. The rain continued to hammer it down outside like it had nothing Hokkaido else better to do. Inside under shelter and around the now raging warmth of the gas heater I took it upon myself to learn the Japanese words for human body parts laughing childishly to myself upon learning the words for both male and female genitalia. With my clothes subsequently dried and the onset of boredom beginning to deliver itself once more I decided to saddle up and head out into the rain. I hugged the coast for several more hours the weather eventually clearing shortly before my arrival in the village of Shosanbetsu. I lucked out here by finding the Misakidai camping ground perched upon a scenic cliff edge overlooking the ocean’s calm and gentle waters. The sun clung to the horizon its bright fiery reflection trailblazing across the Sea of Japan. The camp site also had the added bonus of being free. Well when I say free nobody asked me for any money. And… the extra prize of an onsite onsen was also added to the playlist. This I should note however was not free but for a meagre £1.80 the price of cleanliness was wholesomely affordable. I found it hard initially to conquer the idea Shosanbetsu of having a big bath with other completely butt naked strangers. Was I a prude? Well yes but growing up in conservative England where having a bath was private behind closed doors dictated my abstract gingerness. In Japan the baths are segregated by sex as to presumably discourage a modest amount of jizzing. After removing one’s clothes and placing them in a small basket one can collect a modesty towel to cover one’s sausage. But a Japanese bathhouse is a place of etiquette you can’t just simply go waltzing in after a long hard sweaty days work and belly flop straight into the shared bathing facilities… that would be the most heinous of bath crimes. One must shower first and properly too. A row of stalls bordering on toddler’s potties are generally provided along with a selection of soaps shampoos and a big mirror so you can presumably check out your junk in its reflection - or not. Here one must take the time to liberate one’s self of a day of grime scrubbing hard and furiously so that one is presentable for public bathing. When one enters the bath one should essentially be a shiny clean entity img_5163 so if your elbows aren’t sparkling - you’re not coming in! When my elbows were eventually gleaming I’d find that there were a number of baths available for me to explore all of different shapes and sizes and seemingly varying temperatures - inclusive of an outside bath which would turn out to be my favourite. Again as I appeared to be the only tourist travelling through Hokkaidō at this moment the bathhouse was far from crowded. It was an appeasing relaxant after a long day’s arduous journeying in the rain. Now that I was familiar with this luxury it would become one that I would take advantage of more in the months to come. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tokyo to Tokyo - A Cycling Adventure around Japan.

If I’m honest I’m kind of terrified. I keep telling myself it will be fine but honestly I have no idea what lies ahead of me. I woke up to a strange message a week and a half ago I can’t go with you” it said A woman came floating outta nowhere and stole my heart.” It didn’t come as a massive surprise. J and I had always had one of those connections that you could just feel down to your very core. He constantly referred to it as ‘energy’ and I couldn’t argue – that’s exactly what it felt like. There was a magnetic pull that I resisted intently at first but eventually couldn’t ignore. I didn’t want another impossible romance but thought maybe this time I can just enjoy the moment so that’s what I did. I left swearing I would just let it be where it was beautiful and sweet but too short. Except we were both very bad at leaving it where it was. We kept in contact. There were times I tried to pull away but he pulled me back in. I told myself just to be casual about it. To just see where it might lead whether that was somewhere or nowhere. J always spoke of the amazingness of Mozambique – the intensely blue water the gorgeous landscape and the laid back vibe. Other South Africans I spoke with echoed his words. They all took on the same tone of voice stars in their eyes and their words elongated when they spoke of its beauty. Moooozambique!” They would say entranced. After months of waffling back and forth I decided I owed it to myself to give it a try – not J necessarily but the place and the adventure. Whatever may or may not happen with us was just a bonus if not a big question mark. He promised we’d go together no-matter what. It seemed perfect. Except I started to feel a disconnect in the days before his message came through. It’s like the wavelengths without any sign of weakening or gradually tapering off just stopped cold. I was ready for the news to come I could feel it. This is the story of my life after all. How could I be mad at him? We hadn’t seen each other in months and it’s not like I loved the guy. Between me and someone who is there standing in front of him it’s no real contest. I would have made the same choice. He continued that he’d wrestled with the guilt for the whole two weeks he’d known her love? That soon? Hm OK and offered that the three of us could go together! Why not right? Three peas in a pod. I didn’t have to think about that one for too long. I told him I wished him well but three’s a crowd and I’d be going this one alone. Besides I wasn’t going back to Africa for anyone but me. After the disappointment subsided over the next ten hours surprised that was all it took an unwelcome feeling started to creep in and replace it dread. J is a 6’4 South African guy who used to live in Mozambique. I was happy to tag along. I liked the idea of traveling with someone else for once especially someone with whom I got along so easily and who really knew the country well. We’d had such awesome-sounding plans and I was pretty excited. But those are gone with the wind now. Now I have to start from square one. This isn’t a pity party. There are worse things in life than having to travel somewhere beautiful alone I know. Rather it’s a confession I get nervous before I travel solo too. In fact I get nervous almost every single time. Southeast Asia wasn’t uncharted territory and Europe is hardly intimidating. I knew of plenty of women who had traveled to those places on their own. I couldn’t actually think of anywhere save for a couple of specific places I’d been to in the past that hadn’t been traveled by someone I knew or at least knew of. However I’m not going to shy away and cancel my plans. Not because of some dude. No way. I’ve been saying lately in my newsletters that I haven’t done anything that made me feel badass lately and maybe this is just what the doctor ordered. Maybe it’s exactly what I need to do to feel inspired and challenged again. I haven’t been able to find much of anything written by a solo female traveler who went to Mozambique. So I guess it’s time that someone went there and wrote something. I guess that someone is me. Wish me luck.

I can identify with the romance aspect you are sharing also alot of the time its just about the travel but love is something that is not easy when your dream is to travel. Trust me I know. Ive been a traveller and an expat for nearly 18 months now and it sure can be lonely you meet people that you feel a strong connection with and they touch your soul then leave. Its hard. But I would rather have that touch no matter how short because eventually that connection that touch will be so strong both parties will do what they have to do to make it work. In the mean time I focus on my friends family and doing things I love – especially travel xx Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1106 am True and that’s why I was so ready to just accept it for what it was then and there and just let it go when I got that message. It’s the tough part that comes with this traveling lifestyle but you know it’s still worth it. I really agree. Reply Nathan says 11/16/2015 at 108 pm Im sure you’ll have just as brilliant a time on your own!

I am sure you will have an amazing and unforgettable time in Mozambique can’t wait to hear all about it. Peace and love Liz 🙂 Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1056 am Thanks for your kind comment!

Looking forward to reading more! Reply Kristin says 11/19/2015 at 1038 am Thank you. I definitely still get nervous and now that I’m here I can see that it’s not that hard and everything is going to be fine sometimes it’s just a bit nerve-wracking because you don’t know what you don’t know. That’s why I had to go anyways! Reply Em says 11/21/2015 at 1144 am Hey we were staying in fatimas in Tofo Mozam but moved now to turtle cove in tofo. We know J and the girl from coffee bay.

I would have done–and felt–the same thing. Boyfriends on the road can be so tricky I’m learning the hard way with my travel relationship right now and it sucks when they don’t work out and you’re left up shit creek like that but something great is going to come of it that’s for sure. Even if it’s just getting your badass” groove back. 😉 Hope you’re having the best time of it.

Sober in Southeast Asia An Impossible Mission? 03/11/2018 by Kristin 29 Comments I remember that afternoon in my Berlin apartment expressing to a friend of mine who also doesn’t drink that I was afraid of going back to Southeast Asia as a solo traveler without being a drinker anymore. It had been three years since I’d been back and I remembered it as quite the party place. I tended to bond with people over Chang beers and in backpacker bars. So many of the activities involved alcohol and I was afraid that I’d be the only non-drinker there. He smiled and suggested that the reason why I’d thought of Southeast Asia as such a party place before is because that was the mode I was in at the time. You’ll find the other non drinkers because this time you’ll be looking for them and they’ll be looking for you.” I was skeptical but he’d turn out to be right and this decision would lead me to the best travel experiences of my life. Why no alcohol? Abridging it on the spiritual journey I’ve been on over the past few years I’ve been taking a harder look at the things that have kept me from being happy and at peace. Hangovers always gave me anxiety and when I asked myself what positive contribution alcohol made to my life I couldn’t think of anything. Not one thing. That made the decision clear though taking action hasn’t always been easy. I promise to talk more about that later but for now I just want to share the experience in Southeast Asia and why it was so worth it A different kind of approach Upon arriving back in Thailand I headed straight for a Vipassana retreat in Chiang Rai. I’d done it once before and found it amazingly invigorating. That meant five days the usual is ten but this one was shorter of complete silence meditating all waking hours of the day. I turned off my technology didn’t read rarely wrote and focused on being mindful. I emerged from that recharged and empowered in my decision to do this trip sober. At the retreat center New Life Foundation in Chiang Rai This set the tone for a much healthier month to follow spent adventuring around Thailand’s hidden places in a car I’d rented with my assistant Ashley and my adventure tour partner Pete. We never went to any backpacker places and alcohol never came up on the trip. We were simply too busy having adventures! I loved this healthier approach. I saw 28 out of 31 sunrises that month was surrounded by friendly Thai people in more remote places and otherwise was at a retreat where everyone else was sober too. I was surrounded by spiritual and intentional people and that made it easy and enriching. Sunrise #20 I knew that I had it easy. I didn’t have to work at being social with anyone since I already had a built in network. However that was about to change. In the solo months that followed in Indonesia I prepared myself for more challenges. Feeling like an island Upon arriving in Indonesia I was on my own again. It wasn’t a huge deal since I joined a dive boat in Raja Ampat right away. I was the only non-drinker on board and I did get asked why I wasn’t drinking but I’m pretty used to that now. A nice glass of wine a beer to close out the day or a shot of sake are ingrained in our respective cultures. It’s considered strange to abstain though on the other side of it I wish more people would give it a try. I didn’t say that though I just said that I like life better this way and people were usually satisfied with that. Thankfully nobody was getting wasted on board anyways because the point of the trip was diving. I had a great time and this trip ranks in the top 5 of my life. Was the only non drinker at the beach party but it didn’t matter! After that I landed in Lombok and went straight to Kuta. That’s where it sank in that I was alone and my former methods for meeting people – dorms and drinking – were on the table for what felt like everyone but me. I went to a few bars with people from my guesthouse but it just didn’t feel right. I felt like an island in a sea of people who had different objectives than I did. I was trying to fit into a place I’d intentionally decided to part with. I had a couple of lonely days but thankfully it didn’t last for long. The people I met It didn’t take long for me to realize I’d just been looking in the wrong places. I had to go out with more intention. So I went to a yoga class and struck up a conversation with someone who looked interesting in a coffee shop in Kuta. He turned out to be an amazing adventure buddy for the next few days there – a spiritual person who also just wanted to experience the nature and beauty of Lombok. Next I went to the Philippines and on my first day in Siquijor met a local who also meditates regularly and seeks spirituality. We sang karaoke and swam in waterfalls in the days that followed. I had amazing trip there too and as I sit here writing this I can’t wait to see what the rest of the month of March brings. My trip isn’t over yet! Mermaiding in Indonesia I don’t believe that it’s by chance that I was led to these people and them to me. I realized that by trusting by being open and by focusing on meeting the kind of people who I want to be meeting I put myself in situations where it’s more likely to happen and the chances increased. I also had an amazingly productive three months both on this blog and in my travels. I had so much more time on my hands and to entertain myself I couldn’t just fall back on happy hour drinks I had to go out and experience something. It’s just not possible to see as much as I saw when sleeping off a hangover or drinking afternoon beers instead of afternoon exploration. The sunrises were somehow brighter. I noticed more things. I was in the moment so much more and my mind was sharp. Every morning that I woke up feeling good I knew I had made the right choice. It’s my hope that by sharing this story it shows that it’s possible to have an amazing travel experience without the crutch of alcohol or drugs. I’m not here to try to convince anyone of anything or to demonize anyone’s lifestyle choices. But maybe someone who reads this today will see exactly what they need to right now.

But the rewards are tremendous. You look great too both in your smiles of contentment and physically which are just a few of those. I’ve been that island for many years and can attest to that personally. Keep being the great role model you are nonjudgmental but making good judgments. You have much support here on this. Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 246 am Many thanks! The support has been amazing. Reply Michelle says 03/12/2018 at 1216 am I’ve just returned from a 8 week trip to South East Asia and though it wasn’t an entirely sober trip for me I unintentionally drunk far less than I expected to. There were probably a bunch of reasons but i think it’s mainly that I’m in my late 30s now and frankly I give less shits about trying to fit in hanging out in big groups or finding the party. So I stayed in places I thought would suit me – chilled hostels guesthouses and apartments that it seemed I’d enjoy communal areas but no bar decent bed free tea near to places I’d want to see rather than crazy nightlife. Where I had to use a tour I chose the smaller group experience doing the things I liked rather than automatically picking the cheapest version. I walked all day finding things that interested me and made me smile and having interactions that enriched my day. I did activities that I enjoyed. Lots of things required an early start. Because of where I was spending my time met like-minded people of all ages from 18 to 67 who were more interested in local food markets sunrises experiences exploring a chat over tea finding a good cup of coffee even a good night’s sleep. There was some booze for sure but there was no pressure and for each time I decided to have a beer I noticed there were at least equal numbers of people not drinking. And so alcohol became largely irrelevant. It was hot so cold water and fruit shakes were as common as beers in the places I chose to hang out. I met more people who chose not to drink at all than I’d expected to – either for economy or just because… who knows? I didn’t ask nor particularly care because more importantly it just wasn’t an issue. Some people drank others didn’t the world went round and we all enjoyed our experience in the way we wanted to. Incidentally my days and evenings were full despite not hitting the bars each night – I didnt even read the books I’d hoped to finish! Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 242 am That’s wonderful – traveling with intention and meeting others who do as well! Reply Blair says 03/12/2018 at 429 am I love that you shared this. I too am sober and I backpacked Southeast Asia for 4 months then 2 months in Mexico. On these trips I had a friend so it wasn’t bad or really tempting at all. This past January and February however I went to Africa by myself and I was the only nondrinker around. At first I was scared I wouldn’t meet anyone or make any friends but that was absolutely not the case. I loved every moment of it. And waking up with no hangover I was able to see the sunrises and enjoy all of the amazing things and people that Africa has to offer and I want to go back and explore more. It is definitely possible to travel sober even when there is such a big party scene. You have a platform to share that experience where others will see it’s possible so thank you. Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 241 am I love no hangover too! I actually love going out dancing as well just with way less frequency and for the purpose of enjoying the music. So glad you had fun in Africa and it’s nice to know it worked out well for you out there too. Reply Geoff says 03/12/2018 at 451 am I enjoy reading your adventures and am reading this over a Chang in Chiang Mai. One thing I cannot understand though is why it has to be either one extreme or the other all or nothing drunk or teetotal? Why not just drink or not appropriately for the occasion? Or is it a lack of self control? Which I find hard to believe in your case. Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 231 am To answer it simply for me there’s no such thing as just one like a potato chip. It’s not about self control at all actually. For someone who needs to be one extreme or the other it never was about self control to begin with although that’s often misunderstood. I believe my body just reacts differently to the substance and I don’t get that satisfied feeling from one that a lot of people do. I can’t wrap my head around the point of just one so for me it makes sense to do zero. I will go into more detail in the future but that’s what I’m comfortable sharing right now. Reply RaeAnne says 03/12/2018 at 203 pm Hi Kristin I have never traveled alone especially to another country it’s a little bit intimidating! I think it’s absolutly amazing that you have had so many solo adventures!! It’s very inspiring thanks for sharing!! Reply Kristin says 03/14/2018 at 224 am Aw thanks! I understand that it can be intimidating and it is sometimes a bit more of a challenge – then again so is traveling with others at times. It’s led me to my best adventures. Reply Kristen says 03/18/2018 at 908 am Thank you so much for sharing! I decided to give up drinking this year as I began realizing that alcohol made me feel worse hangover or not rather than better. Also I enjoy experiences more being sober and fully present. I haven’t yet taken my sobriety on the road but I have wondered how that will pan out on my next trip as I’m a fairly reserved person and would use alcohol as the gateway to letting my guard down. I really look forward to reading more on your experiences with sobriety. Thank you for the continued inspiration! ? Reply Kristin says 03/18/2018 at 540 pm I think a lot of people find alcohol helps them come out of their shell but the truth is that was always you in there and the longer you become comfortable as the sober you the less you’ll feel like that’s a necessary crutch. You can still go out to bars and everyone else who is drinking will be more relaxed and talkative and maybe you’ll find that’s enough for you too! Reply Gina says 03/18/2018 at 154 pm Keep on keeping on sister! You inspire! From your can do- I AM WOMAN HESR ME ROAR- attitude to the pics and your candidness YOU inspire! I have commented on your Instagram @thatmtgirl about my journey- BLAST OFF June 14 2018 to forever….I will be embarking on another solo female adventure single sober and enthusiastic! Last time I traveled through Europe I was in my 20’s and in the party mode. Quite different this time and can’t wait to embrace and be immersed in The cultural aide I missed before!!!! Not many get the 2nd chance” and I will embrace not waste!!!! Safe journeys fellow wanderlust junkie! Thatnka for the inspiration! Reply Kristin says 03/18/2018 at 538 pm I love that. Not many do get that second chance and I can say that when you’re not in party mode you actually SEE it for what it is and it’s so much better this way! Reply Taylor says 03/19/2018 at 1204 am It was awesome to read this as someone who has just given up booze 3 weeks ago. It feels amazing that I don’t crave it and helps that I have a roommate who doesn’t drink either but I do sometimes feel the pressure when out to have a beer in my hand as it still feels like a habit. I’m also living in canggu so drinking is pretty common! Thanks for writing this up and best of travels! Reply Kristin says 03/19/2018 at 713 pm Go for a soda water instead! Still bubbly but no sugar 🙂 Reply Ilona says 03/19/2018 at 931 am This is a very inspiring post. I do not like to drink much mostly because I don’t enjoy the taste of alcohol and I don’t see the point in drinking something that tastes awful to me. There are some exceptions and a couple of drinks I had that I really enjoyed but mostly I stay sober. I have never had problems meeting people on my travels despite rarely joining in parties and pub crawls. I think I have made the same experience as you. I might not meet the party crowd but I make great connections and come across like-minded people who enjoy the same things I do. That retreat you wrote about sounds very interesting. I think I would love to join something similar one day. Maybe something where I could also do some yoga or other physical activities meditate and just have a few peaceful days. It is definitely high on my list. I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in Southeast Asia! Reply Kristin says 03/19/2018 at 708 pm You’d probably love New Life then. They have all of that! I do find that I make fewer connections now but the ones that I do make are powerful. It’s been quality over quantity and I don’t have that feeling I did before that traveling resulted in friendships that were mostly skin-deep. It’s been like night and day. Reply Brianna says 03/21/2018 at 154 pm I’m also not big on drinking. I just can’t stand the taste of alcohol! One of the reasons I’ve been a bit hesitant to travel to SE Asia is because of its reputation as a drunken party destination. It’s great to read your perspective on this matter and see that you can still enjoy this area without having to wear beer goggles the whole time! Reply Kristin says 03/21/2018 at 852 pm Totally I came to find it’s just the experiences you seek and the people too. You can find your tribe. Reply Emily Harper says 03/27/2018 at 1059 pm Hi Kristin Though I am not a big drinker I want to challenge myself to turn off my phone or to stop checking my emails and be one with nature. That is a great approach and it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 03/30/2018 at 823 pm Yes it’s another addiction a lot of people have to social media and technology! Reply Jenna Moor says 02/17/2019 at 509 pm I would love to do one of these kinds of retreats please email me some links! Thanks! Reply Cassie McCabe says 03/09/2019 at 1052 pm Thanks for this post! I’ve been traveling and drinking for the last 10 years. Almost 5 months sober and although I’ve been on one trip it was with another sober friend. I can’t imagine the hostel/backpacker life sober. This was encouraging and inspiring. Reply Kristin says 03/13/2019 at 1150 am Yay. Stay strong! 5 months is huge! Reply Bill Winn says 04/03/2019 at 626 pm Aloha Kristin almost a year has come to pass…so on the 25th of April it will be 26 yrs! Last yrs Meeting in The Amazon” will be a tough act to follow! Lol! Your business seems to be booming & i am still handing out copies of Your book to young people I meet. Just for the record I was traveling to Boston back in late September of last yr on the lay over in Seattle I saw a face I thought I recognized. And then she was gone with a mass of people…two hrs later I was about to board my flight & across the hall I see this gal again?! So i get up & head towards this Young Lady half way there I realize it’s Jaguar Jen” from the Peru Trip Your 1st trip. So I shout out Hey Jaguar” & her head snapped around so fast! Jaguar was her spirit animal WE all chose one at the Hotel in Cusco long story short Delta screw up her flight to up state NY so they put her on aflight to Boston one seat in front of me. She might have been returning home after Your Alaska trip. It was a grand flight We had breakfast at Login Airport Boston & went Our separate ways. It is a small world Kristin & with some luck Our will cross paths again. And i am thrilled life is treating You so well. I little long winded but Happy Trails You Lady! Best=BillWinn P.S.—hey that cracks me up. Reply Kristin says 04/04/2019 at 141 pm Aw so cool that you saw Jenn! Glad you guys got to have breakfast together. It truly is a small world. Congrats on 26 years BillWinn Reply Dan S says 01/07/2020 at 1028 pm Hi Kristin So this post just saved me. I am a 36-yo recovering individual 4 years at the end of this month from northern NJ and decided that a soul-o backpacking trip was very much in order as both a college graduation present to myself before I start grad school and a continuation of the journey. Thailand originally appeared on my bucket list for VERY different reasons than the ones that keep it there today. So even though I’m not worried about my choices going there I was apprehensive about the crowds I’d be surrounded in or the isolation I’d feel being apart from the majority. I’m very much looking to experience the type of trip you were discussing. I’ll be starting with diving in Koh Tao in May and plan on doing a abbreviated banana pancake trail which routes me through N Thailand to Laos for the bulk of my trip and then flying to my other stops Vietnam and Cambodia and eventually drops me in Bangkok in July. If you have other suggestions on stops experiences lodging I’d be thrilled to get your perspective. You really just replaced all my fears with joy and hope and if you’re like me that’s a tremendous gift. Thank you so much for being the experience strength and hope I needed Sincerely Dan Reply Kristin says 01/08/2020 at 552 am Hey Dan so glad you found what you needed! I love places where a sport or spirituality is part of the reason why people visit. Then partying isn’t on the docket as much. I’d pick places with some kind of activity you’re excited about and other people are likely to go for the same reason.

Click Here. Has Traveling Made Me Totally Selfish? 04/04/2016 by Kristin 39 Comments This solo traveler I’ve been a little quiet here about my thoughts and the interworkings of my girl brain* lately. I’ve been more likely to write guides show you pretty pictures and tell you how amazing that last beach I saw was and it was! but that’s not the point of today’s post. Today I feel weird. I get these seasonal depressions and people ask me why as though it’s something I should just be able to look inward and fix and I’m like If I knew why I would just not-so-politely usher this tingling anxiety out the door but since I don’t we just stare at each other awkwardly in my brain until one of us wins the staring contest. In a happier time a few months ago while I was lying under a mosquito net in a bamboo hut in Mozambique a nomadic friend of mine was suffering from it and he asked me if I ever feel incomplete or wonder what it’s all for. He asked the same questions I’d asked myself before and am asking again now Is it just another pretty sunset sandy beach mountain peak or valley in between? Was he just spinning his wheels? He’d become desensitized to the beauty of the adventure because the loneliness outweighed it all. I knew those feelings all too well. Yet at the time that he asked me that I was happy as a clam side note Where does that saying even come from? Are clams particularly happy? and while I felt badly for him I was so grateful in that moment that it wasn’t I who was suffering. I know I’m a real great friend right? Good job on the solidarity Kris! I’d arrived at this happy place in a roundabout kind of way. It occurred after a heartbreak over the summer. I met up with someone who I hadn’t seen in years but had never really gotten over. Our reunion was better than an Acadamy Award-winning movie and I couldn’t have written a better way for our story to end had I dreamed up every beautiful possibility. I recall coming home and announcing to my girlfriends that if this couldn’t work out then nothing would and I was going to give up if it didn’t. But of course it didn’t work out for the same reason it hadn’t before My lifestyle. It’s always the culprit. I meet someone amazing and wonder could this one be it? I start to let my girl brain* run wild and it conjures up images of a perfect future. We’d buy a Land Rover together and travel through Africa. No wait! Even better we’d get a boat and sail the fjords in New Zealand or maybe Chile? Norway? Whatever doesn’t matter we’d find some fjords and sail the shit out of them and it would be glorious. We’d make those little sandwiches with gherkins or maybe just catch our own fish and go full Robinson Crusoe on a deserted island just for us. Totally realistic right? But then he’ll turn out to be the one who looked too good on paper to have any time for me with his busy career or I’m away and my would-be soul mate meets someone else or things change we become different people and before it even gets its rudders off the dock it sinks to the bottom of the ocean to become another wreck dive – doesn’t even need an anchor sorry for all of the maritime metaphors. After that I turned a new leaf and decided to pursue only what I wanted and anything else that came my way didn’t matter. I reasoned that until I was ready to live a more sedentary lifestyle this would be a recurring problem and I just needed to live my best life to find happiness. It wouldn’t come from someone else. Then at the time that I needed it most I had an epiphany that was years in the making that I was finally enough. God that felt so good. To finally be happy just with me honestly almost shut up that negative inner voice completely. Once that positivity was coursing through me I was on fire. I poured myself into my work meditation and friendships. Things started working out so well for me career-wise and I hit a milestone I’d been aching for – validation not only by media but also by extension my friends family and most importantly myself. I remember sitting in Mozambique and thinking this is really perfect. And then for some reason that I can’t really identify sitting in a hostel in Chilean Patagonia just a few months later I was dissatisfied all over again. I worried that I’d gone too extreme in the other direction. Have I become someone who can’t let others in? Did I get too selfish to share anything or make any concessions? I shudder to admit that maybe I have. I know that I champion solo travel all the time because it really is the best way to get to know yourself but I start to wonder about that pesky law of diminishing returns too. I mean I’ve been doing it for almost four years now so aren’t I supposed to share it at some point? Do I have to share? I never got used to the idea of sharing chocolate for example and am frankly way happier just not sharing. I think that everyone should just get their own and not ask to try mine. I’m afraid sharing travel plans might fall into that bucket too and if it does I fear I’m doomed I think the key to happiness at least for me is to build something. Not just a business not just a relationship but a life that I can be proud of. Sometimes I am distracted enough from these thoughts by the adventure to forget that but I’m not sure that constantly running is the answer. It can be part of the voyage but it can’t be the whole course I’m sorry I’m really not letting go of the metaphors here. I still don’t know how to make others fit into that scenario but I think I have to be a grown up now and try. …And then sometimes I think that maybe on a Tuesday I’ll just ride my bike east as far as my legs will take me then when I’m tired I’ll lie in the grass and stare up at the clouds picking out fluffy animals until the sky turns black and they become constellations then it’ll be time to take the train home and maybe it’ll be exactly what I needed. No questions answered but none formed either. And in the end I know that it’ll be alright. Thanks for listening. Writing to you is often the most therapeutic of all. Good night. *Girl Brain When you overanalyze every little freaking thing because you’re lying in your bed without any worthy distractions and you’ve been turning something over in your mind way too much – probably something that a potential romantic partner said or something you read that made you feel inadequate or one little freaking word that made you feel meh and you don’t even know what it was now but you can’t shake it and omigod when does this spiral end?!

I love travelling solo but I’ve also come to appreciate the ability to share travel moments with others. As someone who has always been obnoxiously independent and a bit stubborn learning to compromise and share my travels is definitely a work in progress! Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 330 pm Totally! And those times when I’m like I wish someone was here to share this with me” that requires that someone actually wanted to go there with me in the first place and was cool with everything I wanted to do. UGH Reply Dan says 04/04/2016 at 217 pm Couldn’t agree more with everything you said. The more I travel the more I feel lost or unfulfilled at certain times and then feel guilty for feeling that way because having the life of a digital nomad is a dream job. Two things that have kept me grounded is making time to express gratitude on a daily basis and to also work towards something on a daily basis. Whether that’s a business blog your body/health or relationships when you see growth in any area of your life it helps reiterate you’re on the right path whatever that path may be. Thanks for sharing ! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 331 pm Totally agree. If you set aside time to be grateful and to work on something that betters you and those around you it helps so much with the depression. Reply Ashley says 04/04/2016 at 222 pm Thank you for putting this into words! And thanks even more for making yourself vulnerable enough to do so. You’re inspired and inspiring and not just because you’re a solo lady traveller. Keep doing you. And I will continue to aspire to be half the snapchat artist that you are XD Cheers! Ashley from Austin Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 333 pm Thanks so much Ashley from Austin! Seems like a cool enough city to make some cool stuff happen on Snapchat <3 Reply Chiara says 04/04/2016 at 240 pm You may have become selfish because solo travelling eventually leads you there. It’s not all about YOU sorry for capitalizing it’s also about the people we meet in our way. We solo travellers put ourselves first our needs are what matter because we must care about ourselves we must find out how to go from one place to another bargain something find accommodation get food fill time undergo and put up with our hormone swings spend time with our thoughts and most of the time do all of this on a super tight budget. Man this is time and energy consuming. We must become selfish because we are experiencing something that is extra-ordinary. Whoever is not able to understand this is simply not worthy. We should be ready to change up to a certain extent because we are what we are now thanks to the experiences that have made us so selfish. Maybe that person is not THE person for you. When you meet him you’ll probably feel it and see that you’re ready to change something of your life for him and the two of you. Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 334 pm That was poetic Chiara. You put into words what I’ve been grappling with for so long and it seems like you did so so easily but I’m sure its something that you’ve come to realize over all of the experiences and time!. I hope anyone who reads the post also reads your comment. Reply Michael says 04/04/2016 at 247 pm Hey Kristin always appreciate your honest and candid posts. I think like with everything in life you must take the good with the bad. I just finished just over a year of traveling solo and one of the reasons I came back was that I was loneliness. I do think traveling solo is the best thing one can do for themselves and I personally want to travel with someone next time. But I think if the choice is traveling alone or not traveling traveling wins every time. Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 336 pm I agree with you I also know that it’s hard to travel with someone who maybe doesn’t always agree and want to do what you want to do. It’s suddenly like oh you have things you want to do too?! Weird! But concessions are a healthy thing to make sometimes. Reply Matt S says 04/04/2016 at 308 pm Interesting article Kristin. I sometimes get this feeling when I’m On my solo photography trips. I love the independence to do whatever I want and can take my time doing it. I think the question why am I doing this?” does pop into my head when I’m in a exhausted laying on a cheap hotel bed after a long day of photos. I’d just try to appreciate it as much as you can many people are working 9-5 and are Miserable while you are one of the select few carrying out your dream. Cheers. Side note I may be leaving my 9-5 to teach in Asia next year 😉 Reply Kristin says 04/04/2016 at 336 pm Do it Matt! And I know what you mean. Sometimes it seems ridiculous to put so much into something you’re not sharing but I take solace in the fact that I do share my photography and what an awesome passion it is! Reply Mikaela says 04/04/2016 at 432 pm I’m scared of this before I’ve even left my country Australia. It seems for me nothing is ever enough.. I have been fanatically reading your blog along with a few others and one thing that plaques me is what about a house what about assets what happens if i decide to stop travelling at 28 or 30 or 35 and I have nothing but the memories. You can’t live off memories. When do you become too old to have kids. What happens if i don’t own my home before I retire. Why does society make up feel like these are important. Reply Mikaela says 04/04/2016 at 435 pm what if i don’t even want kids but then who will look after me in my old age. Paris i lived there in 2013 wasn’t enough for me i got over it. what if there is no real point to life but to go from good memory to good memory. i could go on. Reply Kristin says 04/05/2016 at 754 am The way I see it I work on the road and I’ve built something. I know lots of people some bloggers but many not who have done something similar. You can take the experience and make something lasting out of it and contribute to your savings. I still think experiences matter more than things. The family thing I’m still not sure about and I worry too. Reply GregC says 04/04/2016 at 632 pm Just keep being yourself. Follow your dreams and desires. There are no instructions for life. We all do what we will. You should be proud of the choices you’ve made. Life is full of what-ifs regardless of the paths we choose. be it safe or non-traditional. You will know if and when the time comes to change your path. No regrets. Thank you for sharing your experiences and feelings. Reply Kristin says 04/05/2016 at 753 am Thanks for the kind words! Reply K says 04/04/2016 at 705 pm I don’t think it is true selfishness you are feeling. I think it is guilt. I’m in this beautiful exotic place Laos right now! why am I not filled with complete happiness and satisfaction everyday?! I should be because society says I should be. But we’re human we have ups and downs. Beauty becomes the norm for us something most people never get to experience. Are we grateful? Absolutely! But that doesn’t mean we don’t get to be human. A good friend once told me Every day during your trip won’t be amazing and that is OK”. My trip was supposed to be a solo 1 year trip but I wanted to kick it off with my boyfriend. It was only supposed to be 3 months but it turned into 6 months. When you do find someone to travel with it won’t feel like you are missing out it really compromising maybe sometimes. His happiness will be equally as important to you. It will bring you closer than ever and sure you will want trips here and there but you’ll become better together. My boyfriend will be leaving in a few weeks and I’ll be solo one of my biggest solo trips yet! 🙂 Hang in there remember we’re all only human. Reply Kristin says 04/05/2016 at 752 am So true it might be guilt. I do often feel guilty for the privilege and then feel self-indulgent for the guilt. Reply Amrissalam Abdoe says 04/04/2016 at 1004 pm now im 17 and i really want to be real traveller travelling tho whole world and taste every inch of sight in a lot of places now i have to prepare my self first like money i have to makes alot of money so when im travelling i dont have some financial problem and brave…. that was really important Reply Sheri says 04/05/2016 at 1238 am Nice article. Sometimes I get those low points on my year long trip. I often wonder are we as humans every really satisfied? I think the grass is always greener. When I was at home I longed to travel. Now that I’m traveling I long for home. Oh brother! Ha! I think you just didn’t find the right match yet. Things might change when you meet someone that really connects with you. Then maybe you might just have that travel and life companion you’ve fantasize about. It’s not so crazy to imagine. You’re doing great in the meantime. I’ve always loved your blog. It’s been a great resource for my ATW trip that is almost over sigh. Good luck Kristin. Reply Kristin says 04/05/2016 at 751 am Thanks so much Sheri. I agree with you that grass is greener syndrome is real and if I don’t pause and practice gratitude it can overwhelm me at times. Reply Mirna says 04/05/2016 at 201 pm Beautifully put. Even us non-solo travellers can resonate with this. Thanks for sharing <3 Mirna xo Reply Ijana says 04/05/2016 at 1045 pm Beautiful you expressed something that I imagine a lot of solo travelers have to deal with and yet often tend to just push aside. In a way I think solo travel is selfish but if you think about it you didn’t come to this planet to live your life for anyone else. If other people get jealous or don’t stay in your life because you’re always traveling that’s hardly your problem because your purpose isn’t to make them happy. That’s their job. Also the way you travel you inject money into small local businesses and help to grow the lives of people all over the planet. I don’t think that’s selfish at all! And even if the intention was selfish which I don’t believe it is for you I’m just saying if it was for some random person then it still helps the local businesses in question. All that said it feels so amazing to give back to people and to be unselfish that I imagine it can be a little unsettling to think that you’re not fully living up to that expectation. Reply Hannah says 04/06/2016 at 621 am Kristen! I know you are struggling with the ability to share now but it really means that you have grown to know yourself! and know what it is you want to do without someone else there to influence your decisions I LOVE to solo travel because it really leaves it all up to me no one else is there for me to take the easy way out and tag along on their adventure I have to make my own. When I travel with others I struggle with people pleasing. I ALWAYS want to make sure that everyone is having a good time and am willing to sacrifice what I want to do to make sure someone else is happy. This seems to be the opposite of your issue and something I know I need to work on. I would love to see a post about how a long-term solo traveler can learn to share their travels. What’s worked and what hasn’t. For example I traveled with two others on a big trip and we all got a non-negotiable.” This was just one thing in each location that each of us absolutely had to do that we wanted to share with the others. We also discussed beforehand that it was ok if we didn’t do everything together. If someone was tired we wouldn’t guilt them into doing something but let them take the day to rest. Laying out ground rules and just talking about the travels you prefer partying more or waking up early and going on an adventure or a mix of both BEFORE you start traveling together can really help sharing your travels go smoother. I hope that one day you find someone that you travel well with! Reply Aaron says 04/07/2016 at 834 pm I’ve always been travelling with my partner so I may be able to share some things with you from this ‘other side of the spectrum’ if we consider the extremes. I have to admit that the frustration does kick in when disagreements and clash of opinions occur but the sharing of experience is also unbeatable. One thing to constantly remember when travelling with a partner is that ‘there will always be the next travel’ and that this trip wouldn’t be the last. This takes away a lot of the frustration in planning and discussion. Usually we leave the planning ‘power’ to one of us for each trip – we’re equally enthusiastic for the travel but we’ll take turns to just be a ‘passenger’ in different destinations knowing that it’s not a permanent role to play. It always comes back down to balancing the beam doesn’t it? 🙂 Reply Kristin says 04/13/2016 at 255 pm Yes it always comes back to balance and that’s a really good idea. That way you split the work and also give the power of making decisions to each person from time to time. I like that method! Reply Joe Shaw says 04/20/2016 at 650 am This is something that worries me too. I’m an aspiring travel writer having just started out really and when my career takes off i’m going to be going to a lot of places. I’m in a relationship and i know he wont be able to come with me all the time so i feel like thats going to be hard. I’m also moving to Sweden in a couple of months for half a year to study – again leaving him. I feel selfish but i know i need to do it for the opportunity. I guess thats the life of a travel writer/blogger. Reply Kristin says 04/23/2016 at 1203 pm It’s not an easy path especially when you love someone who is on the other side of the world. I’m sure in time you’ll know which of the two paths pulls your harder and means more. Reply Kristin says 04/28/2016 at 1215 pm That’s the thing does a life shared mean giving up too many things? I don’t think it does I just think it means involving the right people in the inner circle. The kind of people who understand and also pursue their passions Reply Ryan says 05/03/2016 at 458 am Hey Kristin though the theme here is your girl brain I think as it was happening for that guy too it can happen to any and everyone. I myself have always dreamed of finding a gal that will come traveling with me all over the world and we can take couples photos and share experiences together and be awesome writers and photographers together. In reality I usually meet someone that I fall for or let my walls down only to have them eventually go I’ve realized I live a normal life and you’re a backpacker it just won’t work” or something around those lines. And bam I put my walls back up and say screw it I’ll go solo and be happy just traveling alone.” and for a while I am. I have a spark in mood and creativity and acceptance of being alone. Then like a ton of bricks to use my own metaphors that feeling of lonliness and desire to share the journey hits me. And I get depressed and wonder what the point is and if I’ll ever be able to share this with someone. And it always feels like I won’t be able to. And if I do go home or to a place where I stay for a while I don’t give meeting someone special a chance because I know it’ll end all the same. It’s a really strange emotional flux because on one hand you have the highs of chasing your dream and doing what you love and something daring and lows of not being able to connect with someone or have a connection because of the lifestyle. Maybe I’m a sap but eventually I’d like to be able to look over at someone I care about when hiking a mountain or visiting ruins or relaxing on the beach and go wow this is incredible.” and it be more special because it was with them. Yeah I’m a cheeseball I guess… But even with family or friends since the lifestyle is so different I have a disconnect. Things like I know I won’t be a best man at my best friends wedding because he’ll choose someone who’s around. Or for instance my brother never accepting my lifestyle and though I’ve gotten over it secretly there’s a part of me that just wants him to say that’s awesome you’re doing this bro.” Anyway sorry for the rant… Reply Kristin says 05/03/2016 at 605 am I don’t think any of that makes you a cheeseball. Most people I know who travel so much have the same problem – they can’t balance both of the things they really love – traveling and someone else. I just wonder if slowing down is necessary for anything other than just my relationship with myself to flourish. sorry for cutting out the guys. I know you guys suffer too. Reply Ryan says 05/03/2016 at 920 pm No apologies Kristin! Just was admitting it happens to me as well. And yea just wondering too whether jumping around from place to place or taking a breather and time to focus more inward and accept these things might help. Always so eager to up and leave but still haven’t sorted my mind out fully with other things. Thanks for the good heartfelt post though. Reply Jennifer says 04/16/2018 at 745 am My friend and I had this same discussion just yesterday. He is saving for and dreaming of a life in which he can sail the world for about 10 years. He has children and other responsibilities at the moment and feels trapped. I on the other hand don’t have these responsibilities and he doesn’t understand why I’m not off traveling the world even though I’m going to Costa Rica next month. While I love traveling I don’t know that I want to make the sacrifice of relationships that inevitably happens when you solo travel permanently. I’d love to travel permanently if I had a husband and/or who would come with me. But unless I have that I’m not willing to give up the close relationships I have with friends and family. He argues that just because a person travels full time doesn’t mean they give up friendships but I strongly believe he is being naive. Either that or he values his friendships so shallowly that he believes they can all be easily replaced. Perhaps he and I are just in two so completely different situations that we won’t see eye-to-eye on this one for a while. Reply Kristin says 04/21/2018 at 845 am Thing is it’s not a forever decision. There’s something between traveling permanently forever and ever and taking off for a short trip. You can stop any time that you want to. My friendships are just as strong as they ever were because regardless of where we are in the world we will always love each other. That’s real friendship I think. Reply Stefanie says 02/01/2019 at 621 am Thank you Kristin for sharing these thoughts with us. The post really spoke to me and made me nod many times. We may come from different paths of life and travel differently but I know the feeling and the thoughts you describe oh so well. Thank you for the term Girl Brain” too. I’ve never seen or heard it before but I will remember it the next time I lay awake at night worrying about something or someone I should not spend so much energy or so many thoughts on. I have not made traveling my job and I don’t do it long term but instead do short term trips and long weekend mostly to attend concerts of the bands I love while holding down a 40 hour a week job. It’s a struggle sometimes and involves some juggling but 30 days of paid vacation plus paid overtimes yes I am very privileged in that department can go a long way. Being on the road as much as I can is my life and I guestimate I travel about 40 out of 52 weekend each year loving it too. Yet the price I pay is feeling lonely at times and occasionally catching myself wondering if it is all worth it if there should not be more to life. And then I remember how much energy this life gives me and how much happiness and I remember how I could never be happy with a so called normal life” or with Settling down” loved your post about that too by the way. At times I tried combining this with being in a relationship and lately I have not managed to make it work. That is OK though I enjoy being single being the master mistress? of my own destiny. Over the years I have realized that I am just not willing to compromise or give up any of this just to be a part of a couple. If I find a significant other who wants to share all this with me in one way or another that is cool but I am not holding my breath for it and quite frankly I do not feel the need to be in a relationship to be complete. Sorry for rambling I just wanted to convey how much I can relate to this post and how much I enjoyed reading it. As far as I’m concerned you have build a life to be proud of and I think you share a lot by keeping this blog and letting us take part in your adventures. For me the key to happiness is to make connections and that is what I do when I travel. All the best!

Click Here. I Followed My Grandmother’s Journal Around Europe 09/24/2015 by Kristin 59 Comments She was free in her wildness. She was a wanderess a drop of free water. She belonged to no man and to no city” ― Roman Payne The Wanderess Ever since I came across this line from Roman Payne’s The Wanderess I’ve imagined he could have been talking about my grandmother. I remember her showing me photos of her travels when I was a young girl. It seemed like she had been everywhere from Japan to nearly the whole of Western Europe. When I moved to Taiwan to study abroad at 21 she even whipped out a picture book full of shots from Taipei. She did all of her traveling sans-husband singing in choirs across the world. Her lovely voice carried her from place to place experience to experience. Granny as we called her lived down the street from me for most of my life. She took me to school and picked me up daily. When I went through my spiritual revolution as a child asking her to bring me to church with her we started spending our weekends together too. She was a daily fixture throughout most of my development as a young woman and her strong independent spirit made quite an impact. As I moved into adulthood I sought her counsel often. Granny when she was my age It was the October before she passed away when we had the last conversation we would ever have. Sitting in the house she had lived in since I was a child we spent the last few hours together that we would ever spend one-on-one. I couldn’t have known then that it would be our last conversation but I suspect she might have. I was still unhappily working at my old job and she said to me You know I really think you need to write.” Roughly one year later I started writing regularly on this blog and everyone else’s under the sun who would let me contribute from guesthouses in Cambodia hammocks in Thailand and busses in Indonesia. I had quit everything to pursue a dream partially because she had faith in me and she had a habit of being right. When my mother made plans to visit me in Europe this summer I remembered the photos that Granny had kept documenting her travels. I asked my mom if we still had those picture books and she found me something even better – a journal. It turned out that Granny was a solo travel blogger before travel blogs even existed. We laughed as we read her words speaking of all the experiences from what she ate to hilarious anecdotes about the people she encountered. I felt for a moment like I was sitting next to her on the couch in her living room again. We decided to follow her footsteps around Europe letting her journal be our guide. Granny’s journal traveled back to Switzerland 30 years later Over the course of two weeks we traveled from Berlin down to Heidelberg Innsbruck in Austria through the Alps to South Tyrol in Italy a favorite of mine as well and finished in Zermatt Switzerland. Though I’m party to random acts of kindness from time to time on my travels we encountered incredibly helpful people in just about every place we visited. It was like we had a guardian angel along with us even though I don’t really believe in that stuff. Mom and I in front of the Matterhorn I fully expected to find that tons of things had changed from the time she wrote in her journal roughly thirty years prior versus what we would encounter. The funny thing is the foods we ate were more or less the same. The Alps have been the Alps for millions of years and the people who live among them still speak the same language and go about their lives in more or less the same fashion as they did before. We took the same modes of transport walked the same historical streets and laughed at the same quirky cultural differences that she did back then. The biggest difference turned out to be how we respectively documented our journeys she with pen and paper and I with a computer and blog. This video documents the adventure Granny’s journal led us on and in the blog posts to follow I’ll tell you all about each place that we visited and how you can maximize your journey there too. Wouldn’t it be beautiful if Granny’s journey continued to live on not just through me but through others too? It’s the best memorial I can think of. Thanks Granny for continuing to serve as my guide even from the great beyond. Have you ever visited somewhere because a family member inspired you to? I’d love to hear your stories in the comments!

I envy people like you who love what they do >< Im all tied up with the bond to serve the government for giving me scholarship. Initially thought that was a blessing turned out its a dream-killer *sigh* Anyway I hope you keep on writing. Hopefully one day I can actually pursue my dreams Reply Kristin says 09/24/2015 at 743 am Oh dear 🙁 You can still do what you love in your free time and be great at it. This comic beautifully illustrates someone who did just that http//zenpencils.com/comic/rhodes/ Keep dreaming <3 Reply Brenna says 09/24/2015 at 626 am My parents lived in a van in Europe for two years in the 70s. It was a huge deal for them two broke kids from the prairies of Canada working and travelling and making their way across the continent and back. It was part of the reason why I chose to travel around Europe in my early twenties too… albeit thirty years later. Lovely article and lovely sentiment behind this Kristin. Your granny sounds absolutely amazing. x Reply Kristin says 09/24/2015 at 740 am That’s awesome! I realized a lot of people have a legacy like that or their family members are from here which draws so many of us back over. The stories are always so fascinating in their own way. Reply Susanne says 09/24/2015 at 822 am This is simply amazing. Reply veena says 09/24/2015 at 1033 am I have been waiting for these posts since you first mentioned following your grandmother’s journal around Europe and this was even better than I imagined. I straight up cried during that video and I can’t wait to read your next posts about your adventures! Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 544 pm So glad that you liked the post! Thank you so much for following along and sorry for the long wait. Was tied up with the book but happy to be back into the blogging 🙂 Reply Yasmine says 09/24/2015 at 1131 am Your Granny sounds like a total hero. And there’s such a family resemblance in that photo. Looking forward to reading more about your trip! Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 544 pm She was a total hero 🙂 Thanks for thinking there’s a resemblance! I thought she was so pretty Reply Pauline says 09/24/2015 at 1255 pm I love this and it brought tears to my eyes as I watched the video. What a beautiful tribute to the live of Granny! Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 545 pm I was hoping it would be emotional for others as well. Thanks so much for the kind words Reply Ryan says 09/24/2015 at 800 pm this is so incredible Kristin. I wish I had something like this from my parents or grandparents to hunt down but sadly they never went on any journey of this sort being I was the first to leave the US. I’ve thought about tracking down my heritage knowing we came from Germany and Ireland but haven’t yet. This is such an awesome way to give meaning to a journey and your granny served as such an incredible inspiration for you to travel and inspire others as well. Knowing she’s with ya everywhere! Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 1255 am Then you’ll be the first one to leave a journal behind 🙂 Reply Joann says 09/24/2015 at 802 pm Love this post Kristin! I remembered how my mom’s stories of different cities and towns had planted in me the immense desire to travel. So I vowed to myself that I would make it as part of my life. Keep writing Kristin and safe travels! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 545 pm It’s so wonderful to have such inspiring family members isn’t it? Happy travels Joann! Reply Aisling says 09/25/2015 at 142 am Gorgeous post!! And your video made me cry! I followed that trip on snapchat but the overall video looks amazing. I think its a fantastic way to honour your granny! Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 223 pm Aw thanks for following along and glad it was something that you found moving. Reply Mike Nomadic Texan  says 09/25/2015 at 343 am Kristin My uncle was the traveler in our family. He taught me about cooking fine wines and to appreciate other cultures. So as a buyer for Six Flags amusement parks I was comfortable going to Asia two months of every year to purchase souvenirs. That was in my early twenties. Now in my sixties and retired I am free to travel as I please. My wife and I transferred this passion to our three sons. The oldest lives in Japan and has for four years. The middle son spent time in Costa Rica this year and our youngest went to one of my favorites Ecuador this year. In addition the two youngest sons and I helped build a home in Tijuana two years ago for a needy family. That experience showed me their true character. I loved every minute of it. When my wife retires we plan on setting out on our own to see the world together but in the meantime we are using her vacation time wisely and will be in Europe for the Christmas Markets this year. Your article and especially your video brought memories of my uncle flooding back through my mind. All the times we talked about his love for Europe and my experiences in Asia. I think your grandmother and him would have gotten along grand. Who knows they may have shared a glass of wine in France Belgium or Italy. Thank you kindly for sharing this post and helping me remember why I travel. Mike Reply Kristin says 09/25/2015 at 246 pm Thanks for your lovely comment. The job buying for six flags sounds pretty cool! Of course it makes sense that someone would have to go find those souvenirs and I never really thought about how awesome that would be. If I didn’t do this I would want to do that! It was so cool having someone so well traveled to be your guide through life huh? Perhaps they were at the same place at the same time way back when. It’s exciting to think about. I wonder if coming generations will say the same of us though I don’t have kids. My sister just had a baby so many I can be that aunt. I hope so. Reply Roshan says 09/26/2015 at 1024 pm What a great reason to take a trip. Reply Helen says 09/27/2015 at 231 pm Aw I love this Kristin! Your granny sounds quite the woman! My nan inspires me too. She was a wren in the navy and after the war she sailed over to New York to live for a while and I always feel like I get my adventurous genes from her! 🙂 Lovely post! x Reply Kristin says 09/29/2015 at 606 am She sounds totally badass! I love hearing stories about strong women with wanderlust Reply Amanda | Chasing My Sunshine says 09/28/2015 at 556 pm Kristin this is such a beautiful story. I thank you so much for sharing it with all of us. I cannot wait to read all about your journey. And your grandma was so beautiful! It’s kind of poignant how you mention that many things really stayed the same. A lot of times we think of ourselves as not having similar experiences to our grandparents just because times have changed so much. Maybe that’s not the case at all! My Grammy has always wanted to go to Ireland and I am trying my darnedest to get her over there. But I like to think that I live inspired by her everyday. She always encourages me to try new foods in the places I visit and would be very very disappointed if I didn’t! Reply Kristin says 09/29/2015 at 615 am I hope you guys get a chance to go to Ireland together! I would have really enjoyed traveling with Granny. It’s really nice that my mother and I get a chance to travel together though 🙂 Reply Katie says 09/29/2015 at 422 pm Wow you guys look so much alike! My father is still alive but it’s one of the things we share. My father and I have a great relationship but we are very different people. I’m passionate where he’s practical. I’m creative where he more appreciates the grit for hard work. We have pretty different outlooks on plenty of things but when it comes to travel that’s not the case. Seeing new things and understanding a world different from our own is the most gratifying experience there is. So while yes I’ve had many times where I’ve thought HOW could I be his natural born daughter our desire to see and experience the world will always be at the core of our relationship. Reply Kristin says 09/30/2015 at 115 am That’s so wonderful that you guys have that special thing that you share especially since traveling can be so spiritual and impactful. Plus I can imagine that the combination of your personality types makes for a good traveling relationship. My mother and I are somewhat the same – I’m really spontaneous and she is more likely to plan things. It’s kind of nice when we travel together and she does the planning! Reply Dan says 10/01/2015 at 1122 am Melts the heart. What a great quote to reflect on your grandmother. Thanks for sharing. Reply Kristin says 10/12/2015 at 632 am Thank you I’m glad it resonated with you Reply Ashley says 10/04/2015 at 141 pm I love that you did this! I can imagine it must have been such a special and sentimental trip. My mom’s experiences in Israel sounded so intriguing and they’re one of the reasons I’d love to explore the Middle East. Reply Reine says 10/08/2015 at 1151 am A very heart-warming post! Thank you for sharing! Reply Kristin says 10/12/2015 at 602 am Glad you liked it 🙂 Saw your recent post is about coming to Berlin. I agree with your words about its intriguing kind of deliberate urban decay”. It’s what draws me to this city too. Reply Rika | Cubicle Throwdown says 10/13/2015 at 800 am This is just… wow. What an amazing story!!! My grandparents lived all over the world and when I was little they used to send me postcards from each place. I still have all the postcards maybe I should try to do my own re-creation. The ones that stood out were Iraq Iran Sri Lanka Pakistan India and Japan… that would be an interesting trip! Reply Kristin says 10/13/2015 at 251 pm Wow such adventurous grandparents! I can only imagine what it must have been like for them to travel in those places. Europe may not have changed much but I bet Sri Lanka for example sure has! Reply Mike says 10/13/2015 at 217 pm This is one of your best posts for sure. I can feel the inspiration from your grandmother radiating through your words – and what better reason to travel? I’m sure this must have been among the most special of your travels. Thanks for sharing something so personal. Good luck on the road! Reply Kristin says 10/13/2015 at 248 pm Thanks so much Mike. I really feel honored when others read my words and feel moved. That’s what I hope to achieve and yes she is an inspiration to me still. Reply Mary Hood says 10/16/2015 at 605 am Wow. Just wow. What a beautiful and inspiring story! I’m sure that your grandmother is smiling down at you right now seeing you walk her footsteps and travel the world. What’s really weird and why I think I can really appreciate this is that I am doing something similar. My parents got married in Zermatt Switzerland back in 1972 and backpacked across Europe for their honeymoon. So my fiance and I have decided we want to do the same thing. Much to the disappointment of all our friends and family we’ve decided not to have a wedding or to go the traditional route instead following our restless hearts and wandering spirits and doing something different but also something meaningful as we follow my parents. Again lovely story! You are so lucky to have such an incredible piece of history at your fingertips! Reply Kristin says 10/16/2015 at 814 am Zermatt is one of the places she wrote about the most in her journal. Love the connection 🙂 Reply Amanda says 10/16/2015 at 825 pm Ahhhh that is SO sweet and SO cool. What an amazing adventure – and even more amazing that you shared it with your mom. Reply Alyssa says 10/17/2015 at 428 pm Kristin What an incredible experience. You are so blessed to have been inspired by your beautiful granny. I can’t imagine the emotions you must have felt as you retraced her footsteps and read her words. And to share this experience with your mother! How wonderful. You look exactly like your granny and from what I can tell you share the same adventurous soul. I can’t wait to read more! Alyssa Reply Kristin says 10/18/2015 at 634 am Aw that’s such a lovely compliment Alyssa. I thought she was so beautiful inside and out. Reply Leanne says 10/19/2015 at 248 am What a beautiful post and a wonderful tribute to your Granny too xx Reply Savar Pandey says 10/23/2015 at 131 am This post of yours was truly emotional and I could feel the bond that you shared with your granny. The beautiful description along with the video reminded me of my close family member. This inspiring post shows how one can honour their loved ones. Reply Kristin says 10/23/2015 at 612 am thanks so much Savar. It was definitely emotional to write but I find these are the ones that connect us the most 🙂 Reply Amy says 10/24/2015 at 643 am This brought a tear to my eye – what an incredible experience this must have been to read your Granny’s words and walk the same path as she did – and to share it with your mother! My Nonna emigrated from Italy to Australia her first big adventure – and was still travelling to all sorts of weird and wonderful places right up until the year before she passed away. I don’t have anything like a journal but I do remember her stories and I look forward to visiting the places she once stood at also. Wonderful post. I loved this – thank you for sharing x Reply Kristin says 10/24/2015 at 1045 am It’s so nice standing there and wondering how it must have been when they were there. They’d both love to know that they inspired so much I’m sure. Thank you for reading! Reply Charlotte says 02/21/2016 at 308 am Granny was an absolute beauty just like you are. This is such a lovely and unique adventure following in each others foot steps. Reply Kristin says 02/26/2016 at 212 pm Thank you so much for the kind words <3 Reply Emma says 03/02/2016 at 754 am What a beautiful post. I love the fact you followed your grandmother’s journal. I have my own travel journal started 20 years ago I hope that one day my children will be inspired to visit some of the places I did. I hope you continue to have many more wonderful journeys. x Reply Kristin says 03/04/2016 at 629 am Thanks so much and I’m sure the legacy you document now will serve as inspiration for your children and grandchildren! It’s a beautiful thought. Reply Hannah says 09/20/2016 at 150 pm Hi Kristin You have a really beautiful and inspiring story here. I’m so happy for you that you are able to persue your dreams. 🙂 And also I am really glad that you enjoyed Austria so much also skiing in the winter and you wrote so positively about it. I am Austrian myself but I don’t live nowhere near the alps – I live in the very east of Austria – right next to Lake Neusiedl and close to the hungarian and slovakian border. It’s completely different here – nature wise at least. If you are ever interested to explore another side of Austria I would be glad to show you around! all the best from Austria Hannah Reply Kristin says 09/20/2016 at 157 pm Thank you Hannah! I would love to explore more of Austria. It was beautiful and the food is so good! Reply Dominique LM says 11/17/2016 at 606 pm That video was emotional! Got teary eyed too. I didn’t had the chance to be close to any of my Grandmas as they live islands away & one passed away early when I was 5. I would like to be that Grandma someday. it would be good if my grandkids would get excited reading my travel journeys someday 🙂 Your Granny knows you well enough that you’ll be great in writing and your heart followed suit! 🙂 Reply Kristin says 11/17/2016 at 710 pm Aw thanks for the touching comment 🙂 I imagine that too one day that maybe if I do have children and they have children that they’d read my stories and find inspiration in them. Reply Mara O says 07/18/2017 at 1128 am I’ve been to Innsbruck 3 new years eve back to back. And I think this year we will do the same. I’m from Romania and it is very easy to get there by car and we love it there. Reply Suzy says 01/05/2018 at 323 am My grandparents went on a 6 month holiday from Australia to England and Europe via cruise ship in 1952. My grandfather Albert kept daily diaries all his life and a journal when travelling. Before my father died he gave me the box of diaries and typed up manuscripts photo albums and post cards etc. that fortunately survived 60 years in various places to finally end up where they belonged. With me. They were inspirational and I am turning them into audiobooks ebooks and books. He called his story ‘Innocents Abroad’. Last year I decided to follow in his footsteps and used the journals as my guide in many places. It was fascinating to see how the places had changed or not. This year I’m going to go for 5 months and go to England Scotland Wales and back to Germany Italy Switzerland France and Holland to places I missed in 2017. It’s an adventure tracking down hotels and restaurants museums etc that they went to and knowing that he was once there too. I was the lucky one to end up with them and I often wonder if he is watching over me as I travel. Reply Kristin says 01/05/2018 at 812 pm That’s so amazing that you got to do that! What a wonderful gift – sometimes I wonder if she imaged that I might read them one day or if she could have anticipated that we’d follow the journal years later. Brings tears to my eyes to think about. Reply sam says 08/28/2019 at 830 pm Aww this is so special! What a great idea. And maybe you will inspire you’re future grandkids in the same way- who knows! 😛 Reply Kristin says 09/02/2019 at 1000 am <3 Reply Kate says 11/11/2019 at 1220 am This is such a lovely story. It’s amazing how you followed in your grandma’s footsteps. Reply Stay Connected Home About Contact Me Archives Privacy Policy and Disclaimer © 2020 · Be My Travel Muse.

This is you from the future sailing in to drop a few bombs of knowledge on that you will wish you knew back then. This is going to blow your mind but in the last 10 years you didn’t become a rockstar not that that was ever in your aspirations you’re not a millionaire but you don’t mind that too much and you’re sitting in Berlin Germany. I know! Right now you don’t know anything about Germany except for they speak this complicated language called ‘German’ here. It’s totally crazy. People will tell you that your 30s are the best decade and you will roll your eyes because it is unimaginable to you that anything could be better than your 20s standing in a crowded bar with a sticky floor and dancing to horrible ’00s top 40 music. To be honest your 20s were pretty cool but you spent a lot of them insecure and unsure of yourself. A lot of what I will say will be difficult to hear and I know you hate nothing more than to be told what to do but for once maybe you should sit yourself down and listen. These are 31 little things that you learned in the last 10 years 1. I know that right now the most exciting thing ever is that you can finally get into bars without a fake ID but in about 10 years that is the last place that you will feel like being. Partying contrary to popular music and television does not make you cool and it’s not that exciting. In reality you just want to escape responsibility and use it as a band-aid solution for doing some real growth work. It’ll be painful when you finally do grow up and realize how much time you wasted on being wasted. 2. You’re scared of getting older. Each and every birthday after this one you will probably freak out about getting on in age and each and every year you will remember that you freaked out before and how silly that was because you were so much younger back then. This is where you’ll celebrate turning 31. Not too shabby! 3. Please stop comparing yourself to others. Delete Facebook now it’s a sinking ship of your youth and time. Life is not selfies and manufactured perfection. 4. It is totally OK that you don’t get married or have kids in the next 10 years. You are also going to quit your fancy corporate job and buy a one-way ticket to Bangkok to pursue your dream of being a writer. People will think you’re crazy and in truth you are kind of crazy. 5. Which brings me to please don’t stress about not having everything figured out. The truth is you never will but you will get better at accepting it in time. 6. The greatest skills you will acquire over the next 10 years are recognizing the power of honesty the importance of compassion and the incredible skill of patience. To be honest that last one is still something you struggle with! 7. As the world gets bigger to you you will realize how small you are within it and how little anything you do really matters. You are an imperceptible grain of sand in millennia and millennia in a universe greater than anyone can imagine. So stop worrying so much that you’ll make a mistake because it’s not as big of a deal as you think. 8. You’re going to spend a lot of time alone which right now probably sounds terrible but it will be exactly what you need. 9. You will hear the 20-something motto ‘live life with no regrets because everything you did was exactly what you wanted.’ This is really just a way of making excuses for behaving badly. It is impossible to live a life without regrets. Even the freaking Dalai Lama has regrets. To err is to be human but own up to what you do. 10. You are in control of absolutely everything that is going on in your life. Say that 10 times to yourself anytime you feel like shifting the blame for your decisions to someone else. 11. Money is not and never will be the answer. 12. Fame is not and never will be the answer. 13. Finding someone to love you and be your life partner is not and never will be the answer. There’s nobody coming to save you. You have to save yourself. 14. But love is a beautiful and powerful thing so please don’t shut it out. Give it realistic expectations so that it can actually grow. 15. Look for the good in people. Whenever you feel wronged pause and consider if it was really honestly personal and 9 times out of 10 the answer will be ‘no’ and you’ll feel better instantly. 16. When something wonderful happens in your life reflect on what you did to make it happen and allow yourself a moment of praise. 17. Whenever something goes wrong ask yourself what you did to cause it be honest in your answer and make a change. 18. But be gentle with yourself because change will come much more quickly if you are a lot kinder with your inner dialogue. 19. Question absolutely everything. Question societal expectations and standards question the status quo never stop asking ‘why?’ and challenging commonly-held beliefs. 20. Sour gummy worms are not real food. 21. Not everybody is going to like you understand you or respect you. If you have haters and trolls just for being you then it means you’re doing something right. Nobody who quietly sits in the corner without ruffling any feathers makes waves. 22. Understand that your path will not always be puppies and rainbows and that there is beauty in the hard times and the hell as well. 23. Remember that your greatest gifts are something that only you can give. The same is true for everyone else. Always give others space to pursue their own happiness and bliss. Everybody deserves a chance. 24. I know it doesn’t seem like it but you have so much more privilege than you have any clue about. Practice gratitude every damn day. 25. The economy is going to crash the world will become a somewhat scarier place so what are you going to do? You’re going to go out and enjoy it and prove them all right that millennials are the ‘me’ generation and we’re going to fix the world. 26. You look amazing stop stressing about that ounce of fat around your belly. No those are not wrinkles around your eyes! Your body is the most magnificent machine ever made and so is everyone else’s take really good care of it. Seriously. 27. What kind of car you drive doesn’t matter. What kind of purse you carry doesn’t matter. These things will never make you happy. 28. Chasing happiness will also never make you happy. The destination is the voyage. 29. Your heart is big you are wonderful and you can create so many amazing things. everybody has this ability within themselves. When you let others know that you see it in them you will both be given room to shine. 30. Never make a 5-year plan. It’s a gigantic waste of time. 31. Your imagination is the most powerful thing you have. We were all children once and we all still have that youthful energy within us. Whenever you can find that inner child in others and never forget unicorn obsessed six-year-old Kristin. Each and every year of your life I promise you will look back on the very same day in April and reflect unable to believe all of the things that happened over the previous 365 days. I know that none of this will sink in I know that none of it will really make sense right now and to be honest it still doesn’t even 10 years later. All that said please know that the world really is your oyster and that it’s OK that you didn’t know any of this back then and that you still can’t predict the future now because everything that you did brought you to where you are today and today is pretty damn cool. Until the next decade enjoy the shot of rum in your hand but be forewarned that after tonight you will never want to see another one again.

I think everyone gets a little wiser and more true to themselves as they grow up and personally I’m really looking forward to getting older I’m not even 21 lol. Also imagine the letter you’ll be writing in 10 years when you’re 41 looking back at your 31 year old self! Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 104 pm I know! I hear your 40s can be even better… Reply Anna says 04/26/2017 at 941 am Wow KrIstin. I rarely comment but this is a great piece – full of advice that my 34 year old self could will! hugely benefit from. Going to go and sit with points 15-18 for a while! Thank you … Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 104 pm Glad you enjoyed it Anna! Reply Tuscany Trisha says 05/01/2017 at 131 pm Hi i found this through your link on instagram. Woooah currently on my first work abroad just turned 23 and reading this makes me feel calmer and stop pressuring myself from giving myself ultimatums of lifegoals blah blah. Hehe Reply Kristin says 05/02/2017 at 706 am Down with the ultimatums! The more room and permission you give yourself to be what you will become the better while being honest with yourself as well. Just my two 31 year old cents 😉 Reply Tyna says 04/26/2017 at 948 am Hi! I’m 21 and want to thank you for that. It makes me a little more calmly about future. Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 104 pm You got this! Reply Ryan says 04/26/2017 at 1113 am Really really love this post Kristin. Imagination fo sho. And 5 year plan? Nahhh. Feel ya on that one. I’ve thought about writing a letter to myself at some point given I’m approaching 30 that age everyone freaks out about. Except every growing year has been the best year so far so I feel it’ll only get better. This article feels like a time warp something very Interstellar-esque but I dig it! And gummy worms aren’t real food but sour patch kids on the other hand… Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 104 pm I’ve never had more clarity and ability to realize my own crap and to call myself out on it gently as I have before. Maybe the best really is always yet to come. It feels great being in my 30s! Reply Maricel says 04/26/2017 at 1117 am 32. You have no idea how you will positively influence and inspire a lot of people’s lives from all over the world Kristin. YES it will happen and hopefully that thought will fuel you whenever you feel that things aren’t going your way. xx Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 100 pm Aw the feels! Thank you so much that made me feel awesome and I’m so happy to write things that people identify with. It’s a gift you guys give me. Reply Christina says 04/26/2017 at 1201 pm I love this post Kristin!! All of these items are great and very true – all things I’m gradually learning as a 24 year old. Especially love the point about being in control of everything in your life. Happy birthday 🙂 Reply Kristin says 04/26/2017 at 1259 pm Thanks for the kind words Christina! You are already so well on your way to living an amazing life and it’s something I wish I’d started on even earlier. Have a blast in your 20s! They’re amazing too. Reply Maria says 04/26/2017 at 1218 pm Where did you take this picture with the flamingos? I want to go there now! Please tell us! Reply Kristin says 04/27/2017 at 152 am Renaissance Island in Aruba Reply Jub says 04/26/2017 at 557 pm I’m guessing you had an awesome smile while writing this.

Where can you hang out with flamingos like that?! Reply Kristin says 04/27/2017 at 151 am Aruba! Reply Andi says 04/26/2017 at 701 pm Love it Kristin! Even a 50-something like myself can relate to your letter to your 21-year-old self! Especially loved #13 – no man will be riding in on a white horse to rescue you! And #26 – valuable advice I’m finding even more important as I approach 55 and am focusing on taking care of this magnificent machine”! Happy 31! Keep up the great writing….you’re an inspiration! Reply Kristin says 04/27/2017 at 151 am I’m so looking forward to the 50-something version of myself going back and reading this stuff! It’ll be such a trip. I better keep taking care of this machine <3 Reply GG says 04/26/2017 at 917 pm Hey Kristin Writing to your younger self was a writing assignment I recall once being in a creative writing class. It can be therapeutic I have been told if done properly also associated with Oprah? It is great how you have made it a tool not only for self-reflection but as a great guide for your readers a way of sharing your experiences to bond or help others. As a 31 year old you are wise beyond your years look how far you have gotten since you are 21. You look so happy and so at peace and in great physical and mental shape from all your travels. Very inspiring. I think the one of not being too hard on yourself and owning up but being gentle about it is an incredibly value life lesson. It is hard sometimes to accomplish as I can push myself too hard at times especially being surrounded by so many brilliant people in my life. One thing about going at things alone is that you truly learn how to take control of your life and while you have only yourself to answer to for mistakes you also only have yourself to credit for your successes as well! I think life is incredible while it teaches you humility in that you are just a speck in the universe you also can be so pivotal in the lives of some many individuals you encounter in your life journey through such simple acts of loving-kindness. I think you have seen this from all the people you have touched in your journeys and through this blog. Surely if everyone in your generation could follow your example and continue to work on patience! there could be great strides toward making the world a much better place. Also on another note hopefully one day money/wealth/power will be relegated back as a means to a goal instead of the goal itself and that everyone in the world will be able to enjoy what we take for granted in their own way/culture. Maybe this global instant communication can help. GG P.S. Yes certainly agree that you can’t link your happiness to being loved by others. Funny thing is that by your kind actions strength in being able to do things on your own loving yourself faults strengths and all and not needing it from others that the love suddenly comes to you from all directions! Reply Kristin says 04/27/2017 at 150 am Such a good point about love and all good things coming to you when you’re living an authentic open and loving lifestyle not just towards yourself but towards others too. When I operate from that place I really feel like I have super powers! Reply Somebody says 04/27/2017 at 237 am Haha it’s a cool letter Love it so much ? Happy 31! Wish you will and always be happy 🙂 Reply Kristin says 04/27/2017 at 1258 pm I opened this because I’m struggling a bit with the soon transition from 20s-30s and immediately got freaked out because I thought it was some sort of article that changes names based on your profile. ? Reply Kristin says 05/02/2017 at 713 am Haha! I’m not that high tech! Reply Moitri says 04/29/2017 at 332 am Hi Kristin I read this letter as if I am hearing it from my own 31 years old self. I am thrilled and happy to see that what I always feel is felt by someone else too. I keep thinking about all the things you have said above but its different and much assuring when someone puts it across straight. I am motivated and energetic now to walk this path which i have been dreaming only. Thank you Kristin Love you loads 🙂 Reply Kristin says 05/02/2017 at 712 am Thank you for the love and I’m so glad that this resonated! Reply Laura says 04/29/2017 at 1039 pm Happy Birthday Kristin!! And thanks for sharing these very personal insights. I sometimes do it the other way round I write letters to my future self about all I’m worried about and what I wish to keep in mind. When I read them months or years later I always tear up. Reply Kristin says 05/02/2017 at 711 am Friends have suggested that I do that as well and I agree it is a great way to calm your worries about the future. Such a good idea! Reply Ann says 04/30/2017 at 151 pm I just fcking cried. I need this. Thank you so much for this. You never fail to inspire me. I love you!? Reply Kristin says 05/02/2017 at 710 am <3 Reply Nancy says 05/03/2017 at 109 pm This is really inspiring Kristin! I feel exactly the same under many of the aspects you touched not quite 30 but I’m getting there quickly and the struggle of comparing myself with anybody else is a daily life challenge. I really feel your words. Keep up doing what you’re doing 😉 Nancy Reply Kristin says 05/04/2017 at 424 am It’s a struggle for me too! Just need to remind myself Reply Ben says 05/21/2017 at 856 am Kristin Was reading articles about visiting South Africa a life long goal of mine and stumbled across your blog. I rarely ever leave comments but I was so struck by the purity richness and honesty of your writing I felt compelled. You’re an inspiration. As a man in my early thirties I wholeheartedly relate to your advice. In a world full of billions of different interactions in brief and fleeting moments your words made a small but positive impact in my life. Keep up the great work and safe travels. Warm regards Ben Reply Kristin says 05/21/2017 at 812 pm Wow Ben that’s beautiful. Thank you so much for the kind comment and I’m so glad that you found my writing to be moving! Reply Pauline says 02/06/2018 at 1240 am Hi Kristin Love your writing. Now that I am over 60 I do make 5 year plans in July when the weather at home is cold. it’s my way of organising my world to fit all my ideas in. And I wish I had kept a better diary. Your electronic collection is amazing words and photos. Last year I read part of Freya Starke’s writing about travelling in the Middle East in the early 1900s. Oh that was a different world if you had money and position. Happy travels to you. Thanks for sharing. You are making an inspiring difference. Pauline Reply Kristin says 02/12/2018 at 429 am Oh I just lover her writing! Yes I’m glad to have such meticulous travel records. Maybe someday someone in the future will read them long after I’m gone. That would be pretty cool! Reply Marge says 05/07/2018 at 654 am Hi there Kristin I’ve been reading a lot of travel blogs recently for some tips for a beginner traveler and I could say that this one stands out. You write with pure heart and can relate to some of your articles especially this one. This letter reminds me of the time when I was about to write a letter to my 20-year-old-self when I turned 30 about two years ago. Didn’t pursue it coz I thought that it was a crazy idea but I just realized now that those crazy thoughts that I had or have are actually the ones that would lead you to learn something new and be a better version of you. 🙂 Keep inspiring solo female travelers! Indeed you are making a difference Marge Reply Kristin says 05/08/2018 at 406 pm Hi Marge so glad that you enjoy what you find here and I hope that you do write that letter since even at 32 it’s not too late 😉 Reply Shera Bella says 07/19/2018 at 600 am Super cool post! I am 54 and would love to have one of these every 10 years. Guess no time like the present to start! Thank you for the inspiration! Reply Kristin says 07/19/2018 at 614 am Yes no time like the present and you could even do it yearly! Reply Emily McGuirk says 07/17/2019 at 604 pm I’m just discovering this article 2 years later but have to say I’ve wished I could say a lot of these to my 19 year old self now though I don’t think she would listen either. Good insight into my own Achilles heel I guess. Thank you for being so open and sharing this without holding anything back because it’s actually so reassuring. Looking forward to reading more of your work! Reply Kristin says 07/18/2019 at 1204 pm thanks so much! Glad you found it and enjoyed it. Reply Mahima says 07/20/2019 at 624 am thanks for sharing your amazing experience with us! I really like your blog. keep blogging. xoxo roslia Reply Stay Connected Home About Contact Me Archives Privacy Policy and Disclaimer © 2020 · Be My Travel Muse.

It is 176000 hectares of wild unspoilt rain forest and in the winter has snow. The drive out thorugh a place called Gloucester was pleasant enough and we were forewarned by the information centre that we needed to take all our own provisions as there is nothing in the park once you get there. So we headed off with a full tank of petrol and enough food and water for a few days even though we only planned to stay for one night. Well true to form as soon as we entered the rain forest you guessed it it started to rain. This was when we discovered that Tanks windscreen wipers didnt work this led to the windows steaming up and once we put the blowers on we realised the problem we have been having with the Tank jerking about on the highway is electrical as he started to do the jerk again. Well at least we figured out the problem and can get him fixed so for now I just have to keep jumping out the Lunchtime car and manually wiping the windscreen. All adds to the fun I suppose. When we entered the park we saw a sign saying we should put the CB radio onto chanel 24 as we would be at least 100km away from anyone to help us if things should go wrong. I immediately got on the CB and tried to call out to anyone who might be listening I thought about playing them a tune on the guitar but no one seemed to be around so I didnt think it was worth it. Barrington tops was fabulous even in the rain. We stopped for a spot of lunch and waited for the heavy rain to stop while playing a few games of cards which somehow Shenton managed to win them all so now I am stuck making dinner and breakfast oh well pot noodle it is again I guess. We walked to the devils hole lookout which really was amazing with all the low mist slowly revealing the valley below. There was no one around all the camping seemed to have been at the bottom of the park not up the top where we were 1600 meters above Its raining men I won at cards! sea level but after a bit of real off roading where we nearly got ourselves stuck when the track ended abruptly with a fallen tree we decided to set up camp at the Manning river. It was easy to find and once we slid down the big hill in the now very wet tracks we wandered over to the river. Shenton waded right in and said he would be taking his morning bath there tomorrow however when we got back to camp and he saw about 5 leeches on his legs he decided against that one..... So we set up camp and I put on long trousers with my socks over the top so to avoid any mosquitos or leeches and after a healthy dinner of pot noodle and not nearly enough guitar playing it started to rain again so we quickly packed up everything apart from the table and a bag of rubbish which we put on top of the table and got into the Van to watch a DVD.

Saying goodbye to students is never fun! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Chonburi February 27th 2009 Published March 11th 2009Edit Blog Post lkrhoads Excited P.2 Though I am really excited about traveling for the next two and a half months first with Stephanie and Kari in Thailand then on to Laos and Vietnam it is totally bittersweet to leave the school. It is even sadder in this case because I will probably never see these children again. Even though I may come back to Thailand again in the future it is unlikely that I would find myself in Chonburi. Highly unlikely at any rate though I never like to say that anything is impossible. The end of the term came so quickly for me although the students actually have finals for the next two weeks and will only be on their summer break then. The Thai school year begins in mid-May and consists of two terms with a break between each. I was teaching the second term of the school year and so was responsible for making up the final exams. Sounds rather ominous for primary school! Im hoping I didnt make them too difficult since someone else a Thai teacher probably will be administering them to the students. I spent the last day with all of my classes playing review games for the final. Goofing around in the teacher room These animal hats were used for a play the students were rehearsing Stickers for all! I started letting the older students know that I would be leaving about 2 weeks before my last day. The students in P.4 one of my favorite classes kept asking me over and over again if I was going to come back. A lot of foreign teachers use the month-and-a-half break to visit their home countries before returning for the next term but I had to let them know as delicately as possible that I would not be returning. One of my one-on-one students is making it even more difficult. I think he is genuinely pretty sad about it but he’s letting his feelings out in a very over-the-top melodramatic way. I don’t want to invalidate his feelings at all obviously it is nice that he cares! but it is a little embarrassing to me the way he has been so effusive the last few day. He is one of the oldest students at the school so he is not a small child anymore but he is hanging onto me and rubbing his face against my arms like a cat among other shows of affection. Poor kid has had four different science teachers in two Rooster years due to various circumstances. Im going to post some of my favorite pictures from the last days of school.

We went by car to the restaurant we ate before and had a good meal. Lucky this time we went by car for the place was closed. What now Back to the Hotel where we found out the only place to get something to eat was at Mc Donalds just over the road. We parked the car and walked up there. Now we had not been to Mac Donalds for ages so things had changed. Not to forget menus are in are in the French language. They are on a big screen where you point at the things you want. Well we were at an absolute lost. A girl that service gave us a few hints what to do but even with that help we were lost several times but in the end we did get a hambutger and chips. No idea how we got it but were very happy.. After a good breakfast we decided to take the ski lift to the top of the mountain to enjoy the views that must be there. To far top walk we took the car. Easy parking there looks we were the 20190724_050904 only ones that go up. We bought two tickets that will take you up in two stages and we wanted to go to the top. We were told there are places there you can buy coffee. All good. Advise was given it could be cool up there. so we took our rain jackets. That was a waist of time for it was not cool at all when we arrived at the top.On stepping out the ski lift we saw no coffee shop anywhere. Second fib. Walking around there I could see a red roof and a few chairs but they were miles away and to get there you had to climb. We started on it but after a while we thought we gave that a miss and enjoy the beautiful views that were around. We finished up walking around and the seeing the views for they were absolutely beautiful. the trip down was also spectacular which gave us an amount of video and pictures we could later enjoy. Later that day going to the restaurant for our meal we had another miss. It was closed again this time for it was Monday. Ah well we heard there was a cafeteria 20190725_194820 Alphonse beer that was very good We gave that a try but they were not set up for tourists at all. We had when we arrived make a choice out of a menu all in the French language. We had no idea what it was and we asked the person that served who became very angry that we did not make a choice so we told him that we could not read it result of that was the walked of. Lucky there was a person there that although in very little English offered the excuses for the behaviour of his boss and helped making a choice. The meal was so sobut that happens. This was the end of our visit to Briancone.Next day we left earlier as normal the trip to Colmar was 600 kilometers long and not driving toll toads we would need the time A wonderful trip it was. We went over all sorts of roads and took the time to have a few stops. Managed to get to Colmar in 9 hours was very good going driving country roads special the beginning going over the Alps. Hard to pass as well the road was full with caravan and motor 20190724_203836 homes who were all there for the Tour de France that would come through there the next day. We easy found the hotel in Colmar and arrived at 7 p.m. We saw that Colmar was a real tourist place and very busy. We had problems finding a place to eat for people had booked but a nice lad working in this place called  George place gave us a cosy corner where we enjoyed the nicest Entrecote we ever had. We certainly will come back for some more in the next couple of days we are there. Following day we saw why Colmar had so many tourist. It is a lovely place with picture painting houses and streets who are never straight and covered with cobble stones. Certainly a place to make beautiful pictures and video which we did. A small stream runs through the city and for that reason it also is called little Venice. We have to leave you here more about our trip next delivery.

Dictionaries are a wonderful thing. If anything when youre highly bored or slightly out of your mind from the pain in your mouth....you take a look and see whats really in that magical book. A quick glance in the B section gives me biological warfare לחמה ביולוגית or to build air raid shelters למקלת which in reality that last ת should be a ת sofit but I cant figure out how to do that on my keyboard at the moment. Then comes the distinction of to get someone pregnant which is not equal to to make pregnant however it all looks the same in Hebrew להכניס להיריון. Which come to think of it....who the hell says I come to make you pregnant now. It sounds like some creepy command that a guy makes and the girl should run very very fast from. Much to my amusement but probably not to the English speaking guys with a knack for sarcastic humor is the fact that penis is called a pin here. Hah. Hows that for making a guy feel...well....small? פין!! Then comes that famous stand on the corner job of prostitution. Here a prostitute is called זונה Its not the size of the boat... Its the motion of the ocean. zona but then comes the curious verb to prostitute which is לזנות. How do you get a verb out of that? I thought prostitute is just a catch-all phrase. When you are a prostitute you have sex for money...I would think a verb to have sex for money would make more sense and have the answer be זונה. But nope...instead you to prostitute. Weird. Which speaking of weird...actually reading the hebrew words that are actually ENGLISH is the most frusturating thing I have to do on a daily basis. When reading my little see spot run. run spot run stories in ulpan I come acrossסנדוויץי I look at it in confusion even saying it out loud and sounding like a moron. So finally I give up and ask מה זה סנדוויץי?   What is .........? and my teacher מוראה just stares at me and says sandwich. Duh. Oy. Ok...onto another subject. My pain. Literally and figuratively. See I have this problem called wisdom teeth. Not everyone has this joyous problem and if they do they have had their solution usually when theyre still in high school. Not I said the blind man. This better not be me... Now before you freak out THIS IS NOT ME. And I better not look like this on Wednesday. Ill be pissed. I have been struggling with my teeth since I can remember. When I was younger I was the epitome of the cute little blonde girl what the hell happened??. I had straight bright blonde hair was skinny as a rail wore pigtails had blue-green eyes and straight teeth in a beautiful smile and laughter the sound of a tricycle bell. Or so Im told Anyways somewhere around 12 or 13 I quit gymnastics and grew fat. Or ok...fatt-er than I was. I can narrow it down to almost the day after I quit gymnastics my fat genetics came out and I plumped up like I was apparently supposed to all along and gymnastics had suppressed. I had always had my breasts - taping them with duct tape for matches and then ripping it off later was horrible. But...I was always skinny and then I stopped training for 10 hours a day and all of a sudden I had a cushy butt and birthing hips. Yay. Moving on....my teeth started to shift. I guess when the rest of my body was growing my mouth was not. As the orthodontist told us there was not enough room in my Oh man.... What Im greeted with every single time I check my emails. Oh JDate...you have competition my dear. mouth for the amount of teeth I had and thats why I looked like I had a triangle for my 2 front teeth and a slight overbite. So I did the dutiful and painful jaw bridge thingy where they cement it to your teeth and it goes across the roof of your mouth and every night you use this needle looking key to crank it and it slowly some type of medieval torture idea would spread apart your top set of teeth. Well....I went through this and still my teeth were crooked. Then they suggested the worst hated thing for teenagers braces. Now I would have done it truly I would have but then he said that I would have to wear them until most likely graduation from COLLEGE. At that moment the big red radar in my head went off and my brain shut down the idea. Immediately. I said they give me character and we walked out. My grandparents have not let me live that down to this day....nor the fact that I broke up with my Jewish boyfriend in the 9th grade but cest la vie. So...here I am with too many teeth in my mouth and I continue in my happy life. I had 1 tooth pulled because it was quite painful and not needed and then my teeth starting shifting more straight again. I would happily keep getting rid of the 2nd molars if it made my teeth straight. No one sees those anyways....but I only got 1 pulled. Then...all of a sudden my wisdom teeth decided to start popping up. And pop up they did. I’m talking swollen gums teeth pinching my cheek blech. All painful stuff so I decided to go and get them removed. However the oral surgeon in Pennsylvania was a total jerk and said he refused to take out the teeth because I had an ear infection at the time which  correct me if I’m wrong was caused by the teeth problem. All of that is interconnected anyone who takes Anatomy and Physiology knows this and respects it. Not this doctor so a lot of yelling later I still had the teeth in. Now….I’m getting them out on Wednesday…meanwhile I have no idea where the clinic is and my roommate is coming with me in case they knock me out so that way I don’t end up in Eilat rather than Ra’anana. Should be fun…I’ll let you know how it goes. Oh and consequently while I’m getting my thoughts out here…. Now I know that I’m using the internet in the Middle East and it recognizes my IP address as such…but come on!! Let me repeat this I am an American Citizen therefore I do NOT need an American Visa nor do I want to enter into the Green Card Lottery. Yes my friends I am already a full citizen born and raised in that magical country I use the word magical” sarcastically of the USA. Knock it off. Really. It’s just annoying where every page I go to advertises it. Oh….and damn you yahoo mail for constantly bringing up Muslim Matrimonials.com” I’m not Muslim nor am I feeling matrimonially so just stop. And since when does Yahoo advertise for Muslim matrimonial in Israel?? This is a Jewish state!! What about JDate.com?? Religious preference Yahoo?

The family actually had two houses - one in the valley and one on the high hill where they spent the summers to escape the heat. It is believed that Mary mother of Jesus visited Elizabeth at the one in the hills. John The Baptist is believed to have been born in the house in the valley. John the Baptist was one of the babies that should have been killed when Herod ordered all the boys under the age of two to be put to death however hie was hidden and saved. The church built on the site of the winter home is one of the most beautiful church Ive seen. It is filled with beautiful ceramic tile from floor to ceiling. The pictures I took will not do it justice. As we were walking back to the bus we got stopped by all the street vendors. I really havent written much about them but most of them are quite pushy pushy. At nearly every stop we are greated by the street vendors. They are selling anything from jewelry scarves olive wood anything you can imagine. They always IMG_8304 come down in price. Some start off with 3 for 20 dollars but as you walk away the price comes down...4 for 20 or even 5 for 20. We are all competing for the best deal! Street vendors are also known to be pick pockets but I think that happens more in the heart of the old city. They always try to play on your sympathies. I have no money! I have 5 kids to feed! One of them said I married an American and now Im broke! They always ask You American? Where you from ? We love Americans! We love you more if you spend money!! But one thing is for sure they always finish with God Bless! This group of vendors werent so pushy and we all thought we got great deals that is till we got to the bus and Rod Windom got more necklaces for his 10 dollars than me! Following a very long very winding road which made me car sick we arrived at the Valley Elah. This is the actual place that David slew Goliath. You can read that story in 1 Samuel 17. We even got pictures of the brook where IMG_3776 David picked up his stones. Our next stop was the village of Emmaus. This is one of my favorite places because of the experience I had on my Mid Ohio Valley Womens Walk to Emmaus several years ago.If its something you are interested in you should contact me. Thescripture reading is from Luke 2413-35. There are three different sites that could be the Road to Emmaus but this site is the one that makes sense based on the research. I picked up stones along the path as a remembrance. The next place we visited was Nebi Samuel. It was a military fortress during the Crusaders period a religious site and a place for Christians to stay enroute to Jerusalem. It i the traditional site of the tomb of Samuel the great prophet of the Old Testament. He is the one God sent to anoint David when David was just a young boy. You can read about it in 1 Samuel 16. By this time we were hungry so we headed to lunch. We ate at the Rachael Ramat Kibbutz in Jerusalem. A kibbutz is what we might think of as a commune. It is where many families live IMG_3777 in the same community and work at the community/kibbutz businesses. Everyone then shares the income which is often in the tourist trade. Part of the income is to help grow the kibbutz businesses. There are several kibbutz in Israel. This one is the oldest. Our last stop is another one of my favorites...The Garden Tomb. This is a site that was discovered in the 1800s as the possible site for Jesus Tomb. It is beautiful there and certainly makes you think that this is the actual tomb of Jesus. There is a Skull HIll nearby. It is near a busy thoroughfare. There is a tomb that dates back to the time of Christ or before. The tomb belonged to a wealthy Jewish man but again no one knows for sure. We got to have communion there and it was touching. We have a bus of 39 people from Texas North Carolina West Virginia Delware and Missouri. There are two people from Korea. In the beginning we dont really know one another but after being together riding a bus having devotions eating meals singing laughing and so on we develop a relationship with one another. To share communion together regardless IMG_3779 of background church affiliation or even a language barrier is so touching especially after getting to now one another. It truly is one of my favorite parts of the trip. Once we arrived back at the hotel a very large group of us decided to try and navigate our way clear across town to the hotel we usually stay in when weve gone on this trip....The Olive Tree Hotel. I was sort of the one who lead the way never having used public transportation on my own in a foreign city. After checking with the front desk in our hotel we went to the train station. It took a short time to figure out how to buy tickets for 16 people but we got it done. We got on the train and headed in the right direction. I was thinking this was too easy. Not Bad!! Then four of our party got off at the stop we agreed to and the rest of us hesitated when the door didnt open and then the train pulled away. Poor Robeyn Deem! I only wish I had a picture of her face!! Linda Leasure tried to pull the emergency button and she IMG_8306 succeeded to stop the train but we still couldnt open the door. Panic set in for a couple of people. We asked if anyone spoke English...no one did at least not near us. We got off at the next stop but the funniest thing was the reaction of the people on the train. They were laughing smiling and waving at those crazy Americans that made such a scene on their train! It was hysterical! After several tries we got in touch with our 4 lost people...I knew two of them were scared to death but the other two Rod Windom and Gail Cokeley would remain level headed. Debbie Mincks had been lost the day before so I new she would be terrified thinking this was going to be a repeat of the previous day. And wed all seen Robeyns face. To top it off it was getting dark! We finally linked up at The Olive Tree Hotel. The funniest part of all was just as the four lost souls sat down outside the Olive Tree our bus driver Saleem pulled up opened the door and said What are you doing clear over here? Why didnt you ask me to bring IMG_8307 you? He could have saved us all the trouble and confusion but we wouldnt have laughed like we did. Im sure we were the dinner table talk of all the Israelis on the train.....You will never believe what happen on the train tonight....Crazy Americans!! We finally went to our favorite souvenir shop - Abrahams Antiquities - He was so glad to see us! He started singing County Roads when Bill Dawson walked through the door. The ride back on the train was uneventful but we made sure we all got off at the same stop. Of course we only had a half hour to run to the hotel and eat our dinner but it made for an exciting evening! Now we are all tired in our rooms and packing for tomorrow. After our day of sight seeing some of start the long journey home some prepare to go on to Egypt for 5 days and one brave 73 year old is staying in Jerusalem for 3 extra daysby herself!!! The time has flown. Tomorrow we will visit two museums and go our separate ways. I doubt I will get to blog because Im not sure I will have Internet.

I was’n in any hurry so I decided to take morning 5.55am train from Bangkok to Aranyaprathet. The train takes about 6 hours and there is only 3th class seat available. So I was at the train station little after 5am to get ticket and to find correct train. No problems not so many people at the station yet. The train was OK and few local people tried to talk with me with out success. No common language. There was on Spain/Japan couple that I met in a train and we decided to share tuk-tuk and taxi to Siem Reap. The view was not that special so taking a bus is an option for next time. So we get to Aranyaprathet about on schedule and then we took a tuk-tuk to the border 40 bath = 1 USD or less. The driver tried to take us into the travel agency and next to Cambodia tourist office but we stayed in the tuk-tuk and said ‘border!’ so finally driver took us to the border. That was Open boom I have no idea why there was these booms. Our train was standing in a middle of the road and boom was still open... funny because no one in the tuk-tuk was really sure where to go but we decided to go to the border directly. In border we ‘check out’ from Thailand and then bought Visa from Cambodian custom 20 USD or 1000 bath. No scams even tried here which was a bit of a disappointment. No much queueing here! BUT you still need to fill the immigration paper and queue to other Cambodian border office and there was a queue! It took about 1 hour to queue and of course there was possibility to pass queue’s with some additional fee. I did not see anyone take that offer. When finally in Cambodia it was easy to travel rest of the way to Siem Reap either with Bus or with Taxi. There is ‘free’ shuttle bus to bus center that locates outside of the town and from there you can take a buss 9USD or taxi 40-50USD. Most likely you can get a taxi with cheaper price from the Poipet town in Cambodia side. The road to Siem Reap is really good. In Siem Reap taxi took us to a tuk-tuk station where we took tuk-tuk to town. The view from train A lot of palm trees and rice fields maybe.... price was already included in the taxi price. Our driver wanted to take us to see different guest houses but we decided to stop in the town and have lunch. And we did. Trip from Bangkok to Cambodia border cost for me 70 bath 15 USD and it was really easy trip so think twice before taking mini bus from Khao San Road. And total trip cost was 115 USD and it started in a morning 5.55 train and we were in Siem Reap at 3 pm I think. Taking the normal route train/bus instead of tourist bus gives new experiences and it is a fun way to travel. Of course you need to know the prices and normal scams before hand so you know how to react if something happens. And something will happen!

I went to 75 rue des plantes and the ISA office wasnt there...because I wanted 75 bis rue des plantes which I think I may have walked past but Idk. I went back the other way and around the corner to ask someone how to find it. Eventually I did but before I did I was very upset and lost in the snow and a city I dont know very well yet. I thought the bis was part of the street name but bis rue des plantes was not on my map! At least I got there and was a bit late but it was the first day and I definitely was not the only one and I didnt miss anything. Orientation went well some of the information was the same as what had been online and in the booklets but I did learn a lot. I have my Carte Navigo now picture attached. It works on ALL forms of public transportation and one price gets me unlimited for the month. It has my picture on it so someone else couldnt use it. If it gets lost or stolen they will replace it and reload what you had on it for only 8€. It doesnt need to be swiped only tapped and works from inside my purse which means I am less likely to lose it. I LOVE the public transportation so far. Besides the amazing Carte Navigo paper tickets are universal as well. I have only taken the bus so far but each bus stop has a display that tells you how long it is until the next one arrives and it is very accurate! Each stop has a name instead of just an intersection and the bus announces the stops. There is also a digital display that says the next stop the final destination and how long until it gets there which also seems very accurate! One reason I like the bus is there is not a lot of traffic in Paris especially compared to Philly or NYC so it only really stops at red lights. People do seem to wait for pedestrians in the city as well which is nice. I also like it because I get to see things maybe places I might want to check out which would not be possible from the metro. I got a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower over the Seine as well as a mini statue of liberty on an island in it! I now have a cell phone. Incoming calls are free so let me know if you want the number and can call internationally. PLEASE REMEMBER THE TIME DIFFERENCE!! Incoming texts are free as well. I will also soon be issued a US Virtual number which will have a US area code that people can call locally and it is forwarded to my phone but this does cost me $0.49 per minute. It is not prepaid and it has a contract but you tell them any start and end date that you want. It was only $25 for the phone and sim card but I have to return the sim card when I am done. However the phone is mine to keep and I will hang onto it because it is unlocked so I can use it in the future when I go to any European country and would just need to get a sim card when I do! I bought some things at Carrefour and was surprised how cheap it was for their store brand yay! Unfortunately I didnt have my reusable bag with me and they dont appear to have bags. But it was only 2 things so I just carried them. I missed the first bus home because I was turned around for a minute and no one was like Hey the bus is here but the next one was only 7 mins away. There are several bus lines near me and right near the metro and I love how frequently everything runs. Apparently for the metro you can estimate about 2 mins per stop to figure out how long it should take you to get someplace. Street signs are sometimes hard to find they are attached to buildings rather than standing alone or being on traffic lights. There are signs that stand alone which can be confusing because they just point to landmarks and things so when I thought they were the streets I was very confused. I may go out this evening with some of the other ISA girls but I dont know what the plans are yet. One of the guys from TCNJ missed his flight so IDK when he will be getting here sucks a lot for him but he was very ill prepared and didnt even get his visa or pay for the program until 2 weeks ago!

Advertisement Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Bellingen September 12th 2011 Published August 9th 2017Edit Blog Post NZFrance NSW Territory Covered In Black Geo -30.4524 152.898 5 months late but I didnt think that I would still be continuing with these blogs after three years. This will be the last blog related to my work in NSW and what a way to finish off than with a few bits and pieces from around the state over the period of three months. I guess I should start from the beginning after returning from a 7 month trip to Europe to spend time with Anna I found myself with one last stint up in NSW. I didnt go straight back to the schools but instead my company picked up a subcontracting opportunity with another company to apply a bomb proof film on the external windows of the Australian Federal Parliamentary Building in Canberra. It was exciting and something different to the schools. Our company sent everyone to Canberra for this job and the first delegation of time was 5 weeks during non sitting time. The good thing about this job in Canberra was the company paid for accommodation and food allowance and we were put in some luxurious apartments not too far away. The apartments were amazing especially after staying in hostels pubs and caravan parks for the last Raindrop In A Rain Forest two years. It felt good to be based somewhere for more than a couple of weeks too. The training took 3 weeks by a group of Israelis flown in who are specialists in the application of the film. The Israelis were really cool but the language barrier was a huge hurdle it was either good or not so good. We worked on the main public areas first and then got into the MP offices which required security to escort us around. We eventually got our security IDs and were able to roam freely within Parliment House. We didnt end up having the opportunity to see or work in the Prime Ministers office unfortunately but we got to see a lot more than most people do who even work there. After five weeks parliament was back in session which meant we had a two week break followed by another two week session bomb filming. So it meant I was back to doing the schools and this time we were into the high schools as all of the primary schools had been completed as I was in Europe. There are far less high schools around so it meant that completing an area took no time at Emus all even though the meter-age in the high schools were far more higher figures than the primary schools. We split into groups Dan and Anthony went up to the far north and mid north NSW coast while Sean did the areas around Canberra and outer Wollongong and I went west towards Wagga Wagga and Griffith and beyond the middle of nowhere territory. I stayed the majority of the time in pubs and occasionally caravan parks I was doing the auditing of the schools so my direction was flexible. I ended up at the NSW / Victoria border on one of the weekends and took a night trip to my mate Jamess parent place in Bendigo before heading back up to audit schools in Hay and Ivanhoe which was a two hour drive from Hay through some barren land sometimes with no trees throughout the whole landscape. There were more emus than houses. Then it was another two hour trip back to Hay and a further two hours to Griffith it was a crap load of driving!! My brothers reaction when he went to film Ivanhoe was one of disbelief and shock because it was a long way to travel and nothing being there. Another A Cloudy Rain Forest school I had to audit was a big boarding school which was awkward at the start when I had to check every room in the boys and girls rooms during set times. I had to carry a sign warning the girls I was around theres nothing worse than having a school girl walk into her room and finding you in it thankfully that never happened. I Finished the set amount of schools by the end of the second week just in time for the next session in Parliament House. This time around we werent as lucky with being set up in accommodation and having food allowance because we kicked up a fuss with the amount we were making for the time it took so they upped the wages but we had to pay our own accommodation and food which was a crappy caravan park in Queanbeyan and the one and only expensive hostel in Canberra the YHA. We managed to finish the two week schedule which was to be my last time at Parliament as the days were counting down till I went to South East Asia. Anthony was also S.E.A bound so we both had one week of filming schools Regans Crocodile up the mid north coast of NSW before it was all over. We drove straight from Canberra to Newcastle then further towards Kempsey and Coffs Harbour area where we filmed some schools. I am almost forgetting other activities that occurred among this three month period one of which was a bucks party for my mate Dean. Held in a luxury house in Healesville for two nights included a night of drinking at the house the first night followed by paintball the following day which was so much fun and painful at times too. A couple of others arrived the second night and it got pretty hectic. By the end of the night people were vomiting all around and the Buck was walking around the house with a bleeding toe and missing shoe. One month later and I flew down to Melbourne to attend the wedding of Dean and Renee held in a great little reception place just out of the suburbs. A great wedding ceremony followed by a gorgeous reception party. Finally getting to the place mentioned in this blog is Bellingen. The final destination for my work in NSW. We ended up there on the weekend and stayed at the YHA. Bellingen Cloudy View is a great little place some nice green and hilly areas. We met some nice people at the hostel including Tu a chilled out NZ Maori nurse. I took a trip into the Dorrigo National Park with a German lady on one of the days which was pretty gloomy and rainy but thats why its considered a rain forest. Most of the views were clouded out but the walk through the national park was nice even though it rained pretty heavy and frequently on the rain forest walk. We went and saw a few waterfalls which were pretty cool and on the way back stopping to take some pictures of a group of Emus It was a great little day trip. There we have it the last few months of an amazing job that has taken me to some of the smallest corners of the state to some of the most random places where schools happen to still be operating. I have seen a lot but there are still many areas that I had not gotten to and one can only imagine doing the whole state but after nearly three years on the road living out of a bag and car in hostels Cloudy View pubs and caravan parks eventually took its toll. I cannot express how much this job changed my life it gave me the freedom flexibility as well as the financial bonus to start and continue my passion with travelling throughout Australia and the world. I have met some of the most amazing people along the way one of which is my very special girlfriend Anna. This job and time in my life will not be forgotten easily and I will always look back at it as a once in a life time opportunity that I wouldnt change for the world. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 67 Displayed 27 « Back 1 2 3 4 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message NZFrance NZFrance ... full info Joined July 1st 2017 Trips 11 Last Login April 11th 2020 Followers 2 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 205 Guestbook 42 Photos 11.3K Forum Posts 0 blog=991997 blogger=372584 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=991997 blogger=372584 Advertisement Brief history of Australia Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century.

We convince Chris to take a sickie and skip work so he can serve as our tour guide. It really didnt take that much convincing. We take off for Crowdy National Park and Diamondhead. I had found the parks randomly in my travel searches and Chris was the only Aussie who had ever even heard of them. There are 700 national parks in Oz compared to the 40 or so in the US so it really isnt too surprising. We pack up and head off in the car and immediately spot two koalas in the trees outside of Chriss house. That turned out to be an omen because then journey then develops into one environmental wonder after the next. We see dolphins whales abalone jellyfish osprey strangle figs and squiggle gum. There is also a famous arch and gorge and a beach filled with perfect spiral seashells. Chris is an experienced guide as he has lived image there for 40 years and works as a cartographer. We would have missed a lot without him. Every time he pointed his walking stick those experienced eyes had spotted another treasure. We then drive down to the beach for lunch and just chilling in the grass are a family of wallabies and we see a baby Joey crawl into his moms pouch and start to suckle. It was really an interesting sight. We then have a sausage roast on the beach and we see a lot of blue bottle jellyfish on the shore. I was a bit freaked out at first but fortunately they sting but arent deadly like the box jellyfish. We end our trip at Diamond Head for some beautiful lookouts. We call it a day and Erica and I prepare a vege dinner for Chris and the Swedes. Moa has never had a meal without meat before but devours everything and at least pretends to be pleasantly surprised. Chris was not to be convinced and fried up some chorizo as a side just in case. We end with Ericas grandmas pumpkin pie made from scratch with a roasted grey pumpkin and homemade pastry. Its image divine. The thought of a pumpkin dessert is really weird for non Americans but we are making believers out of as many as we can. Erica then shared more about her experience at the dairy farm and honestly its enough to turn the most ravenous carnivore into a vegan. She talks of the mother cows crying as their calves are taken away how the cows have souls and will hover around a wounded cow in the field until someone helps them. Cows are now put on an assembly line and milked by machines instead of humans often even if they are free range cows. I think it would be a really good experience for others to see so at least dietary decisions are informed and educated. I definitely was really shocked by a lot I heard. I am trying out veganism when I return to the states for 6 months. I know it will be difficult and unclear if sustainable but I know it will teach me a lot about where my food comes from and I feel pretty motivated about it. I am worried about making other people uncomfortable and being a nuisance when out and image about. But we will see how we go! So back to the kitchen and Chris keeps pounding the booze and Im pretty sure he has a bit of a problem or at least dependence. He shares his story about his wife leaving him and raising his kids as mainly a single parent and theres obviously some demons behind his eyes. But he lights up when he speaks of his 32 yo German nudist girlfriend he met when she couch surfed at his place last year. To each his own! Johannes and I wake up before the sun and make our way to the lighthouse for what is supposed to be an epic sunrise. Unfortunately its too cloudy to get a great view but the stillness of the morning is still lovely and the dawn chorus the birds chirping in the am sings in our ears. Erica and I later on do the coastal walk to town stopping along the beaches en route 7 in all. Im surprised Port MacQuarie isnt more of a destination. I guess a lot of people retire there. We hit the road and make our way to image Bellingen. When Erica first planned her year here she originally was supposed to be in Bellingen but plans changed. So she knew of a lot of special places there she had researched before and we chose a hostel based on a friends recommendation. We arrive to the hostel and its like no other hostel I have visited. Everyone is super friendly and the place is open and clean but really it is more of a commune than anything. Surprisingly a lot of locals live there - they just pay $100/week and live In tents by the river. Its a different environment to say the least. So we drink our goon boxed wine and make friends with the local guys staying there. There are a few girls too - a French and a Norwegian who ended up staying and working at the hostel after falling in love with two local boys. It is very much a spiritual and hippie atmosphere. Its hard to exactly put my finger on the vibe - everyone is extremely nice and welcoming and everyone shares and pitches in to clean but all these young people live at a hostel and get welfare checks image true from the government and have no jobs. Their days consist of...nothing. Honestly. Nothing. They run around barefoot and with velour vests they bought in the thrift shop and do drugs when they can afford it and share very deep conversations over bad beer about the universe and crystals. A bit of an anomaly. I decide to embrace the weirdness of it all and let people chat with me about whatever consciousness is popular that night. We do meet a couple of locals who agree to serve as our tour guides in Dorrigo the next day. We hike through the never never land forest and play in the waterfalls and swing from some vines. We also drive through an idyllic pasture and end in the promised land a tranquil secluded swimming hole. We have to make it back for one of the boys welfare meetings so we then end the night with a bonfire and we make everyone makeshift smores as our American contribution to the party. I stayed out until the convulsive guitar playing and conversations about how the fire is like desire desire burning in our souls until it burns out into embers... got a image little too Bellingen for me. We took off early the next day and checked out a hike on the other side of Dorrigo. We drove to the picnic area and started our walk. We were literally the ONLY people on the trail. It was crazy. We hiked down into a big valley and encountered the first true and epic waterfall of the trip. It was crystal clear and splashed into small pools on the volcanic rocks. We stayed on those rocks and swam in the pools for hours. The best best afternoon. We reluctantly made our way back and while eating lunch in the park area two rangers came and knelt down next to us. It honestly looked like they were about to tell us that someone had passed away. At first we were a bit nervous because we may or may not have had all of our clothes on for our sunbathing sesh. Whoops. But then ranger number one who resembled a guy you would see on a Harley in a biker bar launches in You girls having a good time in the park? Oh yes. Best hike thus far image on our trip! Would you like to spend some more time here? Yes. Its a shame we are leaving today. We cant believe we are the only ones here! Yeah theres a reason for that. How would you like to spend a fortnight here? Silence. Because they are demolishing the bridge on the only road in and out of the park as we speak and if you dont leave now theres no way out for two weeks. I guess we missed that sign. So the rangers lead us out of the park and there is a huge tractor on the bridge getting started on the demolition. The workers seem less annoyed than I would have thought and after they make sure the bridge is intact enough for us to drive over and we hightail it out of there. Oh oh dumb American girls. So we left our infamous stamp in Bellingen and made our way to Byron. Little did we know we were heading to paradise. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message arieljayyP ArielP Began this blog my fourth year of medical school.

Each winter in the month of February runners from all around gather for its annual half marathon. This year over 2500 runners toed the line in what is touted as the fastest half marathon in the world”. I was one of these runners taking on a course that from an aerial view appears to be right out of the 90s adventure puzzle computer game of Myst. Run on Al Marjan Island in RAK this series of 4 connected man-made islands extends 4.5 kilometers Everything is metric in this country and it’s hard to get used to into the Arabian Sea or Persian Gulf to some and covers 4.5 million square meters that’s a lot. This year’s race had fabulous weather for this area pushing the mercury to 56 degrees at the gun. A vast group of elite women started the race at 645am with the elite men starting at 700am along with the mass start of everyone else. Course A group of 4 Ethiopian ladies finished first with the top finisher Senbere Teferi crossing with a time of 10545 tying the #10 fastest in the world 10451. Not long after the men’s top finisher Stephen Kiprop of Kenya crossed the finish with a time of 5842 which beat Ethiopia’s Abadi Hadis by 2 seconds. Kiprop’s time tied him for the 6th fastest finish in the world 5818. I was not as speedy as these top finishers having just come back from injury and not getting in a long run over 10 miles for three weeks. That said and taking into account the lack of conditioning and training I held my own and ran a good 10 miles before the tank ran out of gas finishing with at time of 22517. Obviously not my best but not my worst finish either. Support along the course was pretty good and was located about every 2.5km. Bottled water is what everyone drinks in the UAE so each runner was handed a small bottle as they came through the water stop. Each kilometer was marked which means 21 in all. Mentally this messes with my head so I keep my watch on miles because 13.1 miles is much easier to run than 21.1km. After running my second half marathon in the UAE I find that these races are very well organized. Bib numbers are assigned upon signing up for the race and race pictures are sent to you minutes after you cross the finish line. Not only that but you don’t have to pay to download the pictures so there isn’t a large logo superimposed across your face. This race had your packet shipped to you via UPS that included a race shirt along with your bib. Once you finished you were handed a medal that weighed about 5 lbs and a finishers bag” which included a nice towel the second race I received a towel and a race branded coffee cup. The racing season here will soon be wrapping up as come April the temperatures will begin to rise along with the humidity. It is not unheard of for the temperatures to top out around 110-120 degrees. Even early morning temperatures will be uncomfortable with the humidity but at least the sun won’t be beating down on you. Here is to hoping I will survive the UAE summer. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message Larry Stern LarryandJen The timing seemed right and the offer couldnt be turned down so my wife and I made a 5 year commitment to move to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

How To Plan a Trip to India Visiting India is something many people dream of It’s the land of mystery intrigue amazing food beautiful architecture beguiling culture the seat of civilisation home of spiritualism… and so much more. For some travelling to India is a once in a lifetime experience. For others like me it becomes an infatuation or even love – we keep going back again and again for more. And yet travel in India is not always easy. For one thing India is a subcontinent. There’s so much to experience here where to even start? Then there are the crowds the unique food and culture concerns like will I get sick spoiler probably not and then there’s the good old Indian railways booking system. It’s hard to just show up and get the best out of India – unless you’re extremely attuned to your intuition anyway!

Whats In this Guide How To Plan a Trip to India How to Travel in India – Different Travel Options #1 Take a Group Tour of India #2 Tailor Made Travel in India #3 Independent Travel aka Do it all Yourself How Long Should you Spend in India? Where to Visit in India The Golden Triangle – Is it right for you? South India Rajasthan Less Visited Options aka Off the Beaten Path India Countdown – Your Travelling to India Checklist How to Travel in India – Different Travel Options When it comes to how to travel in India there are a few different options which will affect your experience of India significantly and each have their advantages and disadvantages. The beautiful Golden Temple at Amritsar #1 Take a Group Tour of India This is the easiest option especially for first time travellers to India and there are options at different levels of comfort and price point. We recommend scrutinising tour companies carefully making sure you know what’s included and read the trip notes carefully. Pros of group tours If you like company group tours are perfect for meeting like-minded fellow travellers you’ll have a guide on hand and everything is done for you – leaving you free to enjoy your holiday. On these trips you’ll experience very little hassle and it can be a great way for first time visitors to India to dip their toes in before deciding if they want to travel independently in India. Cons of group tours Group tours always involve an element of compromise sharing a room is not everyone’s cup of tea and they can seem hurried at times. It’s also much more difficult to get away from all the other tourists when you on a tour yourself. The following are all companies that we have experience with first hand and recommend for different styles of travel Tour Company Details Service Level Style of Travel Budget Intrepid Travel Click here for more info Various Twin-Share local transport small group trips max 12 people local guides. $$$ G Adventures Click here for more info Various Twin-Share local transport small group trips max 12 people local guides. $$$ Trafalgar Click here for more info Mid Range Guided larger group travel up to 45 often by flights & private coach upscale hotels. $$$$ Insight Luxury Gold Click here for more info Luxury High end luxury trips to Indias finest palaces & retreats. $$$$$ Find more of our favourite group tours of India reviewed in this post. A little more about the companies included in this chart and the styles of travel they offer Intrepid Travel offer small group tours maximum 12 people which are mostly budget – midrange the ‘basix’ trips are more budget with less inclusions the ‘classic’ trips stay in 2-3 star hotels and have some inclusions such as popular attractions and some meals and the ‘comfort’ trips are a step up in terms of hotels and more inclusions attractions & meals. Rooms are on a twin-share basis which means if you’re travelling alone you’ll be paired up with another traveller of the same sex unless you choose to pay a single supplement. Their trips combine must-see attractions with a few off-the-beaten-path villages towns and experiences. Transport is often by local transport e.g. trains and sometimes private minivans. We love these trips for the public transport they include – the perfect way to sample local life in India without the hassle of having to work it out yourself and Intrepid’s Responsible Tourism philosophy which includes pioneering all-women trips in India and supporting local initiatives. Intrepid will always hold a special place in my heart as they’re who I first travelled to India with I had an amazing time. Browse tours & book with Intrepid here. G Adventures are similar to Intrepid travel in that they offer small group adventures along similar lines and itineraries but they have a few different trip styles. We love their National Geographic style itineraries which offer an upgraded experience as well as their India by Rail” family of trips. Some of the G Adventures trips visit Planeterra projects which are social impact projects supported by G Adventures. As with Intrepid rooms on G Adventures trips are twin-share. Both Intrepid and G Adventures attract people from various countries with a range of ages – I’ve been in groups with mostly 60 year olds and groups with mainly 30 year olds and lots with a mix of everything in-between. G Adventures also run some 18-30’s trips for younger travellers. Browse tours & book with G Adventures here. Trafalgar Travel offer well known large group tours around the world and also offer some trips in India. Their trips are great value and include everything you need – from flight transfers to lots of meal inclusions and access to museums & monuments included. Expect higher end international standard hotels such as Hilton and Le Meridien. Trafalgar’s primary traveler group tend to be travellers in their 50’s and above and we’d suggest them as an option if you’re in that age range and looking to get a taste of India for the first time travelling in a comfortable way. We also like Trafalgar’s ‘Make a Difference’ programs which the tours often stop at to see the projects that are supported. Browse tours & book with Trafalgar here. Insight Vacations offer a high-end experience for those looking to enjoy the luxury of India in a small group complete with a travelling concierge! Insight Luxury Gold run several different trips to India which vary from high end to wow palaces. If you’ve dreamed of sleeping in a palace then these tours are for you. They offer luxurious India at a lower price than a bespoke luxury package for individual travellers and run trips around north and South India. Insight Vacations travellers also tend to be in their 50’s and up particularly those that have time to travel and enjoy the finer things in life from good service and food to learning about new cultures. Browse tours & book with Insight Luxury Gold here. Or browse & compare the best-selling India group tours on Tour Radar here! #2 Tailor Made Travel in India If you’re not into group tours and want to determine your own itinerary but would like some guidance in planning booking and / or a guide and driver with you during your time in India then tailor made travel might be the best option for you. There are 101 companies out there offering tailor made travel to India and their services vary from putting together an itinerary for you and letting you do the rest to managing all your bookings to doing all of that plus sending a ground rep to meet you and providing guides and drivers for your entire trip. Needless to say costs vary widely. We’ve had good experiences with and recommend Better Places Travel for customised travel planning. Better Places Travel are a social enterprise committed to responsible and authentic travel experiences and they work with India travel experts based in Delhi to put together your perfect itinerary whether you want to visit India’s highlights or unwind at a homestay or eco lodge. They are reasonably priced and we’ve had great experiences with them during my trip to Ladakh that they organised. Enquire with Better Places Travel here! We highly recommend this option for travellers who haven’t travelled in India before and want some guidance on planning their trip but don’t want to join a tour particularly if you don’t have much time in India. We don’t recommend using general travel planners who aren’t India experts. A regular travel advisor sitting in New York has no idea how Indian Railway tickets work unless or know the best areas of a city unless they’re an expert in India travel. ⓘ TIP Travel Insurance is a must for India – we use and recommend World Nomads – Get your quote here! #3 Independent Travel aka Do it all Yourself The option many people choose especially if they are well travelled or have been to India before. If you’re normally an independent traveller but are feeling nervous about India we suggest looking at the options above. If you want to do it under your own steam here are some tips for what you need to plan and when. Know that India is much less of a destination where you can wing it” and book as you go” than other asian countries. Due to the number of people travelling here India gets busy guesthouses get booked up during popular times and don’t even get us started on the trains. It’s also essential to research ahead of time to know which areas of town you want to be in what tourist scams to be aware of etc. Work out a rough list of where you want to go in India so you can make an itinerary. You don’t have to have dates but once you have a list you can work out the best route. Transport connects some places much better than others so this will minimise having to go back on yourself. Expect long travel days and try to give yourself rest days where you can take it easy. Travel in India can be hard going in the heat and if you’re jet lagged you want to be able to have some time to settle in and acclimatise. Otherwise the temples and cities may all start to blur into one! Book day tours and activities in cities especially at the start of your trip. These can be a great way to meet fellow travellers get some extra insight into the places you are visiting and support local guides. We recommend booking online via trusted sites such as Get Your Guide and Klook – don’t hire guides and touts who say they know you at monuments no matter how smooth their sales pitch is… Book major trains 3-4 months in advance if you can at the latest 1 month out from your trip. 25 million people travel by train in India per day yep so you can imagine that trains get booked up. Book them here on 12go.asia with no need to set up an IRCTC account! Or if you want the full detail read our essential guide to train travel in India here… Powered by 12Go Asia system How Long Should you Spend in India? It’s easy to underestimate how large India is and how long travelling can take. One of the most frequent mistakes we see travellers making is not having enough time to see all the places they want to and so cramming too much in to a tight itinerary. Which – when combined with the culture shock – does not make for the best trip or happiest travellers. To get a good taste of India we recommend you plan to spend at least two weeks in India. We know that holiday time is a luxury but we promise India is worth it. Two weeks in India will allow you to see 5-7 different places in one region of India but is not really enough to cover both north and south India unless you are prepared to see only a couple of places in both. Three to four weeks in India allow you to get to know India a little better – either through exploring one region at a more leisurely place and heading off the beaten tourist path or by combining different parts of India. One month plus and you’ll be able to explore much more of India at your own pace. Anything less than 10 days in India will mean that you can see 3-4 places and focus your efforts on one state of India. If you are flying long haul we strongly recommend pushing yourself to 2 weeks if you can for a better experience. The more time you have to spend in India the easier travel in India becomes as you adjust to a different culture pace of life climate food and everything else. Where to Visit in India Probably the hardest question of all! There are so many places to visit in India you could fill a year with travelling India and still not be done 🙂 Here are a few of our thoughts on the most commonly visited areas of India by first time travellers to India and some alternatives. The Golden Triangle – Is it right for you? Delhi Agra and Jaipur collectively called as the Golden Triangle” are what the vast majority of first time visitors to India come to see. It’s no surprise given the rich cultural offerings of these three cities Delhi is home to beautiful architecture markets and cuisine from around India and is a convenient entry/exit point from India Jaipur is home to Rajasthan’s pink city and is home to princely palaces colourful textiles forts that will make your eyes water with their grandeur and havelis galore. Agra is home to the Taj Mahal Enough said. BUT. There’s a major downside to the Golden Triangle. And that is that it’s the most over-touristed place in India and it’s also the highest hassle. The scams that you no doubt will have heard about / read about online all focus on this area of India as the Golden Triangle sees an influx of cash-rich-time-poor tourists who don’t mind paying 500 Rupees for something that should cost 50 Rupees. These cities are also the more conservative areas of India which tend to see more hassle for foreign women. Not least everyone goes to the Golden Triangle. We understand that as a first time visitor to India you probably don’t want to miss the Taj and Jaipur – and definitely Delhi. So this is what we suggest. Finish up with the Golden Triangle don’t start with it. If you have say 2 weeks in India start further south or wherever you want to go first and then finish with Jaipur Agra and Delhi. By that time you’ll know what the going rates are for things how to find your way around and by much better prepared for any optimistic” sales pitches. Take a Golden Triangle tour that stops in smaller towns along the way so that you can see more of India beyond Delhi Jaipur and Agra such as this one 8 days by Intrepid which includes a rural heritage stay or if you have more time one that takes in a larger area of India and includes the golden triangle such as this 15 day one that covers more of Rajasthan + Agra and Delhi. Travel the Golden Triangle more Slowly. The other thing that creates mass tourism in the Golden Triangle is that most travellers whizz through here in just 3-5 days. If you want to enjoy this part of India more we suggest staying longer – you could easily fill 5 days in Jaipur with all the forts palaces cooking classes browsing & haggling in markets visiting museums… etc. Delhi could fill a lot of time too see our tips for how to enjoy your time in Delhi here. When it comes to Agra we do not recommend a day trip. The best time to see the Taj is at sunrise which means being there before 6am when the gates open which means spending at least the night before in Agra. Click here to book skip the line pre-timed tickets to the Taj. The picturesque backwaters of Kerala South India A much more leisurely and serene alternative to the Golden Triangle is starting in or focusing your exploration on southern India. Kerala is a favourite on traveller itineraries – and for good reason but its neighbours Karnataka and Tamil Nadu see only a fraction of the visitors despite being just as beautiful. Some of our highlights of southern India include Kerala Backwaters – but not on a houseboat which are a bit of an environmental nightmare. Watch the sunset over Lake Vembanad from Coconut Lagoon or at overlooked Kollam at Ashtamudi Villas. Wayanad north Kerala – Homestays galore community tourism and coffee plantations Pondicherry – Like nowhere else in India with its French charm and colourful houses. Goa Backwaters yes Goa has backwaters too – go Kayaking through mangroves or stay in a Portugese style villa that’s a world away from the crowds on the beaches. Hampi – the Angkor Wat” of south India. Bandipur & Nagarhole in Karnataka have just as much wildlife as the parks in north India. Mumbai – everyone flies into Delhi instead but Mumbai is much much nicer yes we’re biased The royal palace at Udaipur Rajasthan Rajasthan The land of kings” Rajasthan is another favourite option for travellers to India. Rajasthan is India at its biggest most diverse grandest and colourful. Rajasthan can’t help but impress and is one of the best parts of India for history-buffs as well as anyone who wants to see its grandeur. Given that Rajasthan is almost as popular as the Golden Triangle read our tips for how to get off the beaten path in Rajasthan here. Here are some of our highlights of Rajasthan Bundi – A quieter town of Rajasthan with a blue city to rival Jodhpur’s Chandelao Garh – A royal homestay outside of Jodhpur Pushkar – People watching over chai at the ghats of Rajasthan’s most holy town Udaipur – Getting up early to watch the sunrise over magical Lake Pichola Read our Rajasthan itinerary for a fully customisable route around Rajasthan or our Rajasthan Travel Guide for more info on the best parts of this state. Less Visited Options aka Off the Beaten Path Fortunately it’s really easy to get away from tourist crowds in India. Outside Rajasthan the Golden Triangle Varanasi Goa and some parts of Kerala India sees relatively few foreign tourists compared to other asian countries. Here are some of our top picks for exploring somewhere a bit different. Kolkata. India’s third city is often overlooked but the culture here is rich the architecture is amazing and Bengali food is unlike any other in India. For extra wow factor visit during the Durga Pooja in Autumn each year. North East India. Remote and culturally separate from much of the rest of India the North East Indian states may be hard to get to but they are rich in tribal culture and heritage are home to one of the best national parks in India Kaziranga and are a wonderful place to connect with nature. Gujarat. With step wells that are more beautiful and less visited than Rajasthan’s its own salt desert and asiatic lions it’s a bit of a mystery why people don’t go to Gujarat much. So take our advice and go! Maharashtra. Outside of Mumbai Maharashtra doesn’t get much consideration from foreign visitors. The beaches and coastline of southern Maharashtra close to Sindhudurg known as the konkan coast” are every bit as beautiful as Goa’s but with nobody on them. Or go on a beautiful drive through the mountains western Ghats to one of the state’s hill stations.

Chanthaburi - Wats with the wabbits? « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Chanthaburi September 7th 2013 Published September 18th 2013Edit Blog Post rrruss Golden Bunny Rabbit Nobody has ever heard of Chanthaburi which probably explains the puzzled looks as we bought our bus tickets and the lack of other visitors when we got there. We only went there to break up a journey that would otherwise have been a little too long for us. As usual getting there was part of the adventure. Our bus transfer from the hotel didnt turn up again! This time it seems that we were not even booked on the bus yet we were there when the hotel owner made the reservation so it certainly wasnt his fault. Eventually we were put in a taxi again! which took us to the Thai border at the expense of the bus company. At the border we were met by their representative who kind of explained the procedure for crossing into Thailand and finding our bus on the other side. There was quite a lot of hanging about but the actual border crossing was simple enough. On the Thai side the waiting foreign hordes were squeezed into pick-ups which took us a few kilometres to a restaurant. Various minibuses then took us all our different ways. Ours was going to the port for a ferry King Tak Sin Monument to Kho Chang but was to drop us in Chanthaburi on the way. We had been told we would be dropped off on the edge of town because the driver couldnt go into the centre. Little did we know that there would be no taxis tuk tuks or public transport at the industrial site where he threw us out at the side of the road. It turned out to be 5km into town and it was far too hot and humid to walk all the way. We asked for help in a small restaurant but they were unable to call a taxi for us. Were not really sure why but eventually one of their neighbours gave us a lift in his car. We had to force some beer money into his hands and we were left very impressed by Thai hospitality. The Kasemsan Hotel is apparently the best place in town so we thought we would treat ourselves as it was just for one night. It was actually quite reasonable and very comfortable. We stayed for two nights in the end and could have stayed longer. That probably sounds surprising if nobody ever goes there but we quickly Wat Bot Check out the monk mowing the lawn! fell in love with the town and there are a lot of day trips you can do if you stay longer. We were completely bewitched by the Chinese style riverside fishermens cottages. Some have been converted into bars and restaurants whilst others house quirky arty shops. There are still a few which seem to house large Chinese and Vietnamese families behind ornate windows. We found one bar where Mr Cob the owner came over to practise his English. We had a good chat and discovered that his name in English means frog so he will always be Mr Frog to us. Before we left he told us to come back the next night because two of his regular customers Mr John and Mrs Helen would be there. The next evening we returned and were glad to have stayed the extra night because John and Helen were great and we had a very enjoyable evening. John teaches English in a local primary school so we had lots to talk about. The town is also famous for its Catholic church. Its very big and was founded by Cambodian and Vietnamese catholics who came to town a century ago. In addition More rabbits to the church the town is known for its gem market. Crowds gathered around tiny tables inspecting and trading precious stones. At weekends it is supposed to get very busy and it must be quite interesting to see. With only a few traders active the camera lens seemed a little intrusive so we didnt hang around too long. There are several wats and temples around too. They are probably the most colourful ones we have seen on our travels. We even saw the monks out cutting the grass using some pretty antiquated machines. Most of the temples are in the style we have become accustomed to on the trip but there were a couple which looked very Chinese with magnificent dragons. This blog was called Wats with the wabbits because everywhere we went we saw rabbits. The lamposts around the central park with its lake and tributes to King Tak Sin were topped with golden bunnies. Street signs were adorned with white rabbits. There were even topiary ones. Luckily we met Mr John and discovered that the rabbit is simply the symbol of the town. They certainly brighten the place up. Our next destination was the island Island on the lake of Ko Samet so another minibus journey was waiting for us the next day. The Thailand part of our trip had got off to a very good start. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 22 Displayed 22 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 19 Message Russ Pearce rrruss Russ and Trish are still in Spain 7 years on and loving it!

Op de 10e dag zijn we naar Matsuyama gegaan. We deden dit per veerboot. Er zijn veel snellere boten die binnen een uur op de plaats van bestemming zijn maar onze boot was een van de tragere soort. De reis duurde 3 uur waardoor we in alle rust om ons heen konden kijken en ook nog een beetje konden bijkomen van de afgelopen dagen. Eenmaal aangekomen pakten we een bus en een tram om al vrij snel aan te komen bij ons hotel welke zon beetje in het centrum van Matsuyama zat. Vanuit hier gingen we al vrij vlot met de groep aan de wandel om de belangrijkste punten van de stad te zien en ons te kunnen oriënteren. Patrick liet ons een tram-dagkaart kopen. Normaal is dit niet nodig omdat je de kosten van de kaart er pas uit haalt als je minstens vier keer met de tram reist maar we zouden nu alle uithoeken van de stad bekijken via korte tramritjes - dus was het zeker de moeite. Het grappige is dat deze dagkaarten in feite niets anders zijn dan kraskaartjes! Je moet dus niet voor de lol nog een vakje open krassen want dan is die Het kasteel Weer die verdraaide kersenbloesems! hele kaart niets meer waard! Eerst gingen we naar het grote shopping plaza - een groot overdekt winkelcentrum van enkele kilometers lang. Hier konden we allemaal op eigen gelegenheid lunchen. Daarna gingen we naar een plek waar een oud kasteel stond. Deze hebben we ieder op eigen gelegenheid rustig verkend na een grappig ritje in een stoeltjeslift. Het kasteel stond namelijk helemaal bovenaan de top! Ook hier waren weer prachtige kersenbloesems. In het kasteel zelf mocht je niet met je schoenen komen - je kreeg plastic slofjes. Het was net het verhaal van Goudlokje... Alle schoentjes waren voor Alexander te klein en voor Wendy te groot. Er waren hele steile trappen die met die schoentjes vrij moeilijk te beklimmen waren - en afdalen al helemaal. Met veel moeite en bijbehorende geluiden wist Wendy uiteindelijk de bodem van de trap aan het einde van de route te bereiken waarna de suppoost die daar stond riep Safe! met bijbehorend baseball-handgebaar 😊 Japanners zijn trouwens dol op baseball. Veel steden hebben ook hun eigen baseball-team met stadion. De volgende dag was een facultatieve reis buiten Matsuyama maar Alexander en Wendy besloten de twee dagen in Matsuyama te gebruiken als Kappa! Overal zijn in Japan schattige wezentjes en afbeeldingen te vinden rustdagen. Ze hebben lekker uitgeslapen al waren ze als nog vroeg wakker en de stad en haar straten op een rustig tempo verkend. Eén avond hebben ze ieder op eigen gelegenheid wat gegeten. Alexander was in een locale eettent neergestreken en kwam in contact met een Japanner van dezelfde leeftijd naast hem. Uiteindelijk deden alle Japanners mee in het gesprek - als eenmaal één contact heeft met een buitenlander is het allemaal ineens niet zo eng meer en wil iedereen gelijk meedoen! Elke ochtend eten we broodjes die we van een bakker hebben gehaald - maar deze zijn of heel zoet of heel hartig. Heel lekker maar Wendy zegt dat ze haar brinta begint te missen. Japanners zijn trouwens dol op eten. Veel televisieprogrammas draaien om voedsel en er zijn overal eetgelegenheden. Ook taartjes en zoetigheid houden ze erg van. Overal geldt in ieder geval dat het er mooi uit moet zien. Japan is ook een beetje een wegwerp-maatschappij al zegt Patrick dat ze bezig zijn dit te veranderen. Alles wordt individueel ingepakt en er gaat veel plastic en papier in om. Dit komt omdat gemak voor de klant de hoogste prioriteit heeft. Dit wil ook zeggen Lekker eten Hmmmmmm~! dat als je een bakje yoghurt koopt dat je je geen zorgen hoeft te maken over een lepeltje - deze wordt ook in je plastic tasje gedaan. Het mooie is wel dat als Japan besluit iets te doen - zoals recyclen dat dit dan ook binnen een maand gebeurt en klaar voor gebruik is. Iedereen doet daar dan ook aan mee. Niet zoals in Nederland waar het jaren duurt voordat een besluit ook daadwerkelijk wordt uitgevoerd... Het is gewoon een heel efficiënt en samenhorig land. Matsuyama is trouwens weer een stuk mooier en schoner dan Beppu. Wel is het ook hier zo dat bij winkels of huizen elke vierkante meter nuttig gebruikt wordt in de lengte of in de hoogte. Het komt erop neer dat overal winkels verstopt kunnen zijn - wat wel eens lastig is als je de borden niet kunt lezen. Nu zijn we op weg naar Kyoto - naar zeggen de culturele hoofdstad van Japan. We zijn benieuwd! En uitgerust die twee dagjes rustig aan hebben ons goed gedaan - al kreeg Wendy wel een beetje heimwee haha.

I have to admit I was more than a bit nervous...a lot more than my normal travels. Would the experience live up to my hyper-expectations? Shortly I would begin my walk of 400 kilometers 250 miles in 28 days. I have never attempted to accomplish such a feat. I had trained for this but would reality be much more difficult? I planned daily walking distances on the Camino to be shorter at first and then building up to longer distances as my body became use to the routine. But would I be able to accomplish my goal of reaching Santiago by 4 October without damaging my feet legs or something else? Many pilgrims experience similar anxiety so at least I am not alone in this regard. My anxiety was shared with my family. The day before I departed I dropped my daughter Rosanna her husband Evan and son Connor at the Colorado Springs airport following a ten day visit. After the normal farewell hugs and kisses Rosanna gave me another hug explaining that the second hug was in case I Bob at the Sagrada Familia didnt survive the Camino. Linda chimed in to remind me that she wouldnt retrieve my body...she would send my son Will. So with all this reassurance I began my pilgrimage... 4 September 2016 Sunday. My original departure time when booked months in advance had be leaving at 220 PM  giving me less than an hour layover in Houston to catch the flight to Frankfurt. Now my flight was rescheduled to 845 AM which meant that I would have to set my alarm for 6 AM and then have a sleepless night wondering if it would go off. But I slept fine and the alarm went off. Linda dropped me off both of us trying to hold brave faces. We wouldnt see each other for five weeks. My first stop was IAH Houston TX where I now six hours between flights not the original 50 minutes...connections are somewhat like Goldilocks and the Three Bears...either too long or too short but never just right. I recently got a Chase United Explorer credit card and received two passes to the United Club. So I spent six hours in relative comfort. My 630 PM departure to Frankfurt Germany was delayed for 90 Sagrada Familia entrance minutes reducing the time I had for my layover in Frankfurt to one hour. I dont sleep well if at all on planes so this additonal anxiety of possibly missing a connection led to a sleepless night. 5 September 2016 Monday. I arrived in Frankfurt at 1 PM caught my 200 PM flight to Barcelona where I arrived about 4 PM. I planned a couple days in Barcelona to get over jet lag and decompress and to tour what is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe. I had checked in my backpack so after picking up my backpack at the luggage carousel I took the free shuttle bus from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 and walked to the adjacent Rodalies train station paid my 4.10 euros for the half hour train ride to the Sants estatio station where I transferred to the metro system to the Drassanes station. My hotel was just a short walk up the Ramblas. I checked into my hotel the Benidorm where I dropped my backpack. Based upon the conceirge´s recommendation I ate an early dinner at the Quinze Dits on the Plaza Real and returned to the hotel washed my clothes in Sagrada Familia the sink and turned in at 9 PM. 6 September 2016 Tuesday. I began my one day tour of the most important sights of Barcelona by sleeping in. I had awakend at 3 AM but decided to try to fall back asleep. I woke up at 930 AM which meant that I had missed my 9 AM reservation at the Sagrada Familia. Nevertheless I took the Metro to the Sagrada Familia station. It was a short walk to La Sagrada Familia the cathedral considered by many to be Antoni Gaudis finest masterpiece. At the ticket office I purchased another ticket for 130 PM. They said I could get a refund for the original ticket it has since become so stained from sweat from walking the Camino in high temperatures that it´s not readable...such is life. So I had a couple hours for lunch. I had a jamon y queso sandwich and mango smoothie. I then stopped by a pharmacy to buy some anti-inflamatory cream that isn´t sold in the U.S. which turned out not to be very anti-inflammatory...just smelled like it was. Then it was time to visit Gaudi´s incomplete Sagrada Familia. Construction began in 1882 according to Sagrada Familia the neo-Gothic designs of Francisco de Paula del Villar. A year after construction began Gaudi took over. He took a more Modernista approach to the project which became his life work. Gaudi lived to see only the Nativity Façade the apse crypt and one tower complete. Following Gaudis death in 1926 the building process dragged on slowly until the 1950s when construction began in earnest. By 2000 the roof of the main nave was completed. The building process continues with hopes that construction will be complete by 2026 the centennial of Gaudis death. In the nave there are pillars which resemble thick trees and the ceiling is a remarkable vaulted structure where the branches of the trees meet. The most magnificant part for me was the stainglass windows. Two circles of blue had Camino and Santiago written in them. I spent about an hour there. I then walked down back street to get to the Casa de Terrades. My next stop was the Casa Mila also known as La Pedrera designed by Gaudi. This apartment building was built between 1906 and 1912. The building has no straight lines and no load-bearing walls. Barcelona is certainly an architects delight. Here Sagrada Familia I met Petko and Hristina from Bulgaria but living in Greenwich. We talked for a while. Then I turned south on Passeig de Gracia and soon arrived at Illa de Escordia Block of Discord so named because of three unusual buildings the Casa Batllo Casa Amatller and Casa Lleo-Morera. The Casa Batllo otherwise known as the House of Bones reflects Gaudis fantastic style interpretation of Modernisme or Art Nouveau. The façade is made to curve like a wave and is covered with a mosaic of colored glass and ceramic fragments. The roof looks like the back of a dragon. The adjacent Casa Amatller owned by a chocolatier uses architectural elements from Germany and Holland. The German influence can be seen in the Gothic windows and the stepped gable was borrowed from classic Dutch architecture. The Germanic façade includes figures of knights dragons and other characters. In the foyer there are pillars and a grand staircase reminiscent of story book castles. The Casa Lleo-Morera is a modernist Art Nouveau building inspired by nature and organic motif. I continued to walk down the Passeig de Gracia boulevard passing many fashionable stores to the Placa de Catalunya the major public square Sagrada Familia with the light shining through the stain glass windows of the city and surrounded by important buildings. From here I entered the ancient backstreets of the Barri Gotic neighborhood soon arriving at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia not to be confused with Gaudis La Sagrada Familia cathedral. The is the Archbishops church. The site where the church stands was also the location of a Roman temple and first century church destroyed by the Moors replaced by a mosque. Construction of the present church began in 1298 and was completed in 1460. A Gothic façade adorned with statues and figures was completed in 1889. I then cut over to the Las Ramblas the famous walking street with flower stands newsstands restaurants and the La Boqueria Market an enormous indoor market. The market began as a traveling market in 1200. At first it was an open-air market near one of the city wall gates. By now I was starving so I had a Dunkin Coffee frappe and a cream filled donut...I´m sorry! My next stop was the old port which was totally redeveloped an includes yacht marinas quaysides with flowers restaurants and shops. I walked along the promenade and then returned to my hotel for an Sagrada Familia entrance early night. So let me tell you about the hot weather Spain is having. Before I departed the U.S. the weater forecast was for 80 degree temperatures. Well weather forecasters the world over are liars except in places where every day is hot or cold and Iceland where they have every kind of weather every day. When walking down the Passieig de Gracia I noticed that eveyone except a Norwegian stopped about 30 feet from the crosswalk to wait for the light to change. Then I noticed they were standing in the shade. I commented to the lady standing next to me that the Spanish were smart to take advantage of the shade. She told me that the temperature this day was the highest for this date in 50 years...above 100 degrees! Walking along the Passeig de Gracia also had another advantage. Every 10 yards I passed a designer store with its door open and blasting out air conditioning. As for humidity none of my clothes that I washed the previous evening dried. In fact a shirt I hadn´t washed became damp. 7 September 2016 Wednesday. I woke up early due to jet lag and a wake up Casa de Terrades call and caught the metro back to the Sants estatio where I caught the 730 AM train to Pamplona. I arrived at 1117 AM and began my pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 26 Displayed 26 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 141 Message Bob Carlsen Home and Away I started blogging on Travelblog in 2009 entering trips beginning in 2007.

A tiring day even though we were sitting down for most of it. Aomori is a port town on the east coast and is as quoted in a brochure about 2 hours 59 minutes north of Tokyo. When planning this section of the trip we chose this town as it was on the coast and within reach of Hokkaido if we wanted to go further north. Rags was a little worried that the accommodation we had booked the Toyoko Inn Aomori may be a little less than expected and we had booked it for 5 nights. His worries were allayed. The modern-looking hotel just over the road from the railway station gave us a room on the 9th floor which was larger than any other we have been in these holidays. A walk through a nearby part of the town found it to be an interesting and quite modern town with a good feel Aomori The Bay Bridge just near our hotel. As spectacular in daylight too! to it. Should be a good base from which to end our enjoyable trip! Monday 27th March Last night we made the decision to explore the near neighbourhood today. We had an early Japanese breakfast of rice with cold meat and condiments hot soup and coffee before returning to our room to catch up with our chores. It is pointless going out too early as nothing seems to be open in Japan before 1000hrs. First stop was the nearby Fish and Vegetable Centre. We found something resembling a market but it was very quiet and there wasnt a great variety of either. We spent a little time looking at various shops and stalls around them before crossing a bridge across the railway lines where we found ourselves in a more average neighbourhood. we did note that this area was not as clean and tidy as most of what we have seen of Japan but in fairness not all the snow had melted and cleanups may have followed. We walked around a small marina and towards the Aomori Bridge a spectacular construction reminiscent of a harp. Before crossing it we decided to explore some buildings in Aomori The Prefectural building. Very impressive building there to greet the tour ships that dock just behind it. the distance. The first was a casino and from there we went to a building marked COOP. This store had all sorts of shops and the first we entered was like our $2 shops. Had a good time there looking at various things and walked out with various knick-nacks for home and for the grandkids. Rags is like his father who else would return from a trip to another country and return with a packet of sandpaper? The supermarket was good too and confectionery for presents and a 1.8 litre bottle of Suntory whisky for us to take home were purchased. A cold walk across the Aomori Bridge followed the wind being icy and strong. We crossed the harbour and left the bridge at the Aomori Prefectural Building a 76m building in the shape of an A for Aomori. This was set up for tourists especially those that came off the cruise ships which would moor there with stalls selling the local products such as those made from apples and other tourist junk. Lunch was a different type of noodle soup to what we had previously had once again delicious. Rags made the error of saying he wanted Hirosaki Beautiful snowflakes dropping on us on the way to the castle. to got to a department store to look at some kitchenware. We found a department store no kitchen section but a good range of ladies clothes all at sale price! He was rewarded with a Starbucks coffee and a pastry Judy with a new dress and a jumper. Seems to be an inequity there but then again we arent home yet! The cold was getting to us now so back to the hotel. Tonight neither of us felt like braving the weather for dinner and as we had a late lunch we were happy with nibbles left over from yesterdays train trip and a few drinks. Tuesday 28th March This morning we caught the local train and over the next hour watched the passing countryside become whiter and whiter due to the snow remaining getting deeper and deeper. In fact it did start snowing but the snowflakes just melted when they hit the ground. The Aomori Prefecture is where the Fuji apple was developed and as our destination of Hirosaki is considered the Apple Capital of Japan you could almost call the town the home of the popular Fuji apple. Just out of the town boundary Hirosaki We werent sure whether this was the Castle or the Keep. Restoration work was on everywhere. is the Hirosaki City Apple Park where a large range of different apple trees are grown. We didnt get to this section mainly because there was little to see at this time of the year with the trees bare of leaves and the ground covered in snow. It was snowing as we left the train and walked down one of the main streets - a mall - of the town and even though it was cold it didnt seem too bad as there was no wind. Our main objective for this tour was to visit the Hirosaki Castle and the huge parklands around it.The castle itself is closed to the public as much work is being done to restore and repair it. Soil around it has swelled putting the keep and the wall fronting the moat at risk. The keep tower has been moved and they are in the process of removing and then rebuilding the wall. We were able to get close to the building walking through large gates and reinforcements over 3 circling moats. There were workers shovelling snow away from the building as we walked past. After taking many photos and standing on several past lookouts Sukayu Onsen If you look carefully you still wont see Judy! we made our way back towards the railway station time having got away from us and stomachs telling us it was lunchtime. As today was our wedding anniversary we wanted to make the day a little special and Rags had spotted a pizza shop advertising Guinness. With both of us happy to have a change from the Japanese food we have been eating and enjoying we made this our choice for lunch. Unfortunately they had no Guinness for sale they just used a sign with that brand on it but their pizza was very tasty although rather expensive. A few more little purchases were made at a local store before we relaxed for an hour in the warmth of the train before returning to Aomori. After a shower and change of clothes Judy bought a nice warm dress we shared a bottle of wine we bought to celebrate before setting out to find somewhere nice to eat. This wasnt easy as it seemed Tuesday wasnt a day all the restaurants opened or they didnt seem nice enough for our special dinner but we did end up in a posh looking Italian one. A fancy looking meal was had amongst Sukayu Onsen Lots of snow still around it. the chandeliers with the waitperson hovering. We did feel a little guilty at not having Japanese food for both the meals out today and will keep looking for that special Japanese meal. Wednesday 29th March We had another interesting day today we caught a local bus which took us to Sukayu Onsen. An onsen is a traditional Japanese communal bath and this one set high in the snow fields opened in the mid 1800s. It is one of the few left in Japan where both male and female can bathe together. The smell of sulphur dioxide from the volcanic water was strong when we entered the old wooden building but inside it is not noticeable. We were supplied with a towel and another cloth about the size of 2 washcloths the latter to be taken in to splash yourself with either cold or hot water. It could also be used to be modest but was so small it was a waste of time. On entering the large room you see two large pools one at about 40 degreesC the other a little cooler. There is also another tub at the side with bowls next to it Sukayu Onsen The snow depth is shown on the sign. and here you go to thoroughly wash yourself before stepping into one of the other pools. It is very warm inside and quite steamy with the water in the first pool you enter giving you a bit of a shock with its temperature. We stayed in for about 10 minutes before settling into the cooler pool for a longer time. There were only a few other people in the water one elderly lady and three or four men. Very little notice was taken of us and we felt quite comfortable there talking to each other. After about 30 minutes both of us were looking a little more wrinkly than normal so we left for our respective change rooms and met in the main foyer once again dressed. Rags was impressed that Judy overcame her qualms about going in she rather enjoying the experience. We did time it well though a bus of tourists arrived and it may not have been such a serene time with all of them there. After a soba buckwheat noodle soup lunch and a walk through the shop there we found our bus to return to Aomori. This was the same one we had come Aomori The final temple we looked at. up on and the driver greeted us as if he was our personal driver which he almost was as there were no more than 4 or 5 other people on the bus at any time. He had driven from Aomori at a very sedate speed this obviously set by the company as we had to wait at several stops for a few minutes before moving on. The return journey was the same and winding down the steep mountain passes with the snow several metres high on each side we appreciated his careful manner. On disembarking at the terminus Rags thanked him and complimented his driving receiving a big smile in return. Today we elected to have our room cleaned by the staff at the hotel the other days we just had the towels changed and the bin emptied. This was done as part of our green mindset as sheets dont need changing every day and the room was clean with us only being in it for only a short time or for sleeping. The previous hotel used to reward guests who did this by giving them a bottle of water and although that was appreciated it negated any green Aomori Now this is a soup! saving. Be that as it may the room was not ready yet and we sat in the foyer for a short time watching the world go by until they were ready. Judy had some work to do for her students so the rest of the late afternoon was spent in our room. Thursday 30th March Another stillcold yet fine morning with showers forecast for the afternoon. This will be our final day in Aomori and we have done most of the things we were hoping to do and then a few. Judy hadnt had a good nights sleep bed too hard and wasnt feeling 100%! MISSINGAfter a leisurely breakfast and the usual preparations we went out and finally located the fresh fish and vegetable markets. Here you can buy a set of tickets and you get a bowl of rice. The idea is to then go around to the participating vendors and exchange these tickets for samples of their fresh fish scallops prawns roe and the like and then sit down with some condiments and enjoy your meal of sashimi. It did sound interesting but as we had no appetite so soon after breakfast and Judys Aomori fish market Here you can buy tokens to trade for pieces of fish to have with your rice dish. tummy wasnt quite ready for raw fish the thought of cold seafood in the cold environs of the market did not really appeal. Instead we walked further down the main street well away from where we had been before finding ourselves in a more local type of area. One shop selling all sorts of tableware caught our eye and we walked out of there with a few things for ourselves and possible presents. A supermarket was next and here again we purchased a few things such as drinks and nibbles. A bottle of a drink Judy had last night will be added to our luggage this joining the bottle of whisky already there. It wont take much to fill our duty-free quota the way we are going! Even further down the street we came to a local temple and as we hadnt been to one for a couple of days we entered at Judys insistence. Nice enough place and we saw a monk removing an offering to the gods of fruit and drink for safe-keeping. On the return walk we crossed to a street running parallel to the street we had been on to find we had come Bay Bridge across a seedier part of town with many bars advertising ladies many with multiple rooms opening into the laneways. It may have been an interesting place to see at night but Judy didnt think so. Judy did find the spot of the day a little further on a cafe packed with locals at 1145hrs. A spot was found for us and the next 45 minutes or so had us enjoying one of the best lunches we have had this trip. Judy had a chiili tofu dish with squares of tofu in a sauce on top of rice plus miso soup Rags had a huge bowl of chilli soup with ramen noodles chicken cabbage carrot bean-sprouts spring onion and mushroom. Both of us struggled to finish our meal but we did try hard. Rags will definitely try to replicate his soup dish when we return home. With the skies becoming grey and the wind rising we took that as an omen to stay in our room for the afternoon Judy having a lot of uni marking to do and wanting to get it finished as Sunday is the deadline and well be busy flying home that day. Neither of Aomori Nebuta Figure We saw these in many spots around the town. they relate to the Nebuta Festival that is held in August every year. Nebuta refers to the float of a brave warrior-figure which is carried through the center of the city while dancers dance around in the float. us was very hungry but we did go out in the evening as we thought we should have something. We ended up at a small cafe nobody spoke English and there was no English menu. Through sign language and pointing to the menu we ordered two dishes which looked like pizzas and a bottle of hot sake to share. Two egg pizza-like dishes came out a bottle of room temperature sake with one glass and a glass of what Judy described as marmalade and water followed. The pizzas were great one seemed to be seafood and the other vegetable. Rags even found an oyster in his! The sake had to be shared as it was 20% alcohol and Judys drink was only ok. All in all though it was a very enjoyable meal. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 20 Displayed 20 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Judy and Rags Weggs We first backpacked in Eastern Europe in 2001 visiting Netherlands Slovakia Slovenia & Italy.

Barcelona Barcelona and Barcelona. That’s right 3 tours in a day. Sure doesn’t pay to stuff your schedule up here and try and cram 3 days touristicity into 1! That’s a word I made up but it sounds like it should be a word. I did the hop on hop off bus on routes red and green and then did the walking tour of the old city. That’s seven hours of my life I won’t get back. No. I love tours really. I didn’t hop off the hop on hop bus as that would have make the 2 hours red or 2.5 hours green tour even longer and I wouldn’t have had time for the 2.5 hour walk. I find the facts and figures interesting informative and educative who would have thought that?. The hop on hop off was OK although the commentary was difficult to follow particularly if the bus gained any speed and the English was a bit clipped and didn’t always follow through on subjects that they raised. The walking tour one of those red Sandermans something like that ones that are everywhere was good. I know you tip at the end but if they are good I Yes it’s the Columbus Column. don’t mind paying what I th is fair and reasonable. Our guide was good. She was animated and passionate and managed to impart lots of information to all parties except the 3 American groups that could not listen for that period of time and simply gave up early and disappeared. The tour concentrated on the Gothic area here and the streets lanes and alleyways are far too narrow for cars or buses so it gave a very different view of Barcelona than that gleamed from the bus tour. We are on the train and heading towards Malaga although we get off one stop before Malaga. But back to Barcelona. Lee had a little sleep in whilst I did the bus thing. Saw some Guadi the Arc built for the 1888 Expo some Guadi the Botanic Gardens some Guadi the Zoo some Guadi the Olympic diving and Olympic Stadium some Guadi the Marina some Guadi and well you can guess the rest. The Gaudí thing is strange. He’s almost as important to Barcelona as Messi is to Barca Football Club and he is regarded very highly here. Lee is the only person I know who doesn’t Yes it’s me leaving the base of the Columbus Column. marvel at his buildings and design but I can understand her reservations. He is over the top completely and it is no surprise to see his name used as an adjective nowadays. His work was used as an ostentatious display of wealth and/or power in his day and viewed through that prism it can look too over the top. It must be a nightmare to construct and maintain and his masterpiece to this day remains unfinished and will probably remain so according to locals. Officials expect completion in 70 years! Plenty to see here and quite a fascinating history although so much has been relatively recent. It wasn’t until the mid 1800’s that the original Roman wall that defined the city and city limits was demolished and the city really started to spread. In the 1950’s what are now attractive and popular beaches were waterside slums and shanty towns. The Olympics were the catalyst to fully reclaim the areas even importing sand from Egypt. The biggest impression from Barcelona is just how many people live work and play in the city. There are apartments everywhere and they are lived in. Catalonian flags and liberty ribbons are everywhere and the strong The old Barcelona Bullring now a shopping complex. Catalonian spirit is felt everywhere. It’s not that they are anti Spanish it’s just very strong pro Catalan. If they could work out issues like currency trade EU membership and a plethora of minor details I get the impression they would be out in a flash. There’s a history of recent serious political oppression here and the days of Franco are not that long gone and certainly not forgotten. The old town section is that rabbit warren of alleyways and narrow passageways but it’s now a tourist destination of Mecca proportions. Guides with sticks poles umbrellas flags and whatever weave their way through leading some very bewildered looking individuals like the Pied-Piper of Hamlin with his wide eyed children in tow. I know it’s a gross overgeneralisation but I’m yet to see an interested American tourist here. It’s a surprise really as like us they don’t really have a history longer than 400 years or so so you’d think it would be different enough and interesting enough to be of interest. One asked if the Jews of Barcelona during the 1200’s were persecuted by the Nazis! And I think he asked to demonstrate his knowledge of world affairs! They were Gaudí. even surprised that the big news was Columbus returning here and telling Queen Isabella of his findings in 1493. They associate 1492 with the event and none of could make sense of the 1493 date. We had the compulsory paella last night and very good it was too. I had the seafood and Lee the chicken and pork mixture and both were robust and flavoursome. But 2 beers and a sangria big enough to swim in may have had something to do with the positive judgement. Our hotel the H10 Casanova was one of a group of 10 within 2km or so of each other and was really comfortable. Very comprehensive breakfasts which we fully appreciated yesterday and woofed down a bit today because we had a train to catch fairly early. Breakfasts even had gummy bears but the place is so classy no one had them! The hotel had a pool and deck area that we didn’t even see let alone use in any way. That’s the price for missing a day! Our train has managed 299 km/hr but has not hit the 300 mark yet but we are streaking through the countryside. Already the familiar Gaudí Chimneys. dry sand countryside littered with irrigated crops and olive trees has overtaken the light industrial landscape so common on the perimeter of tracks and outskirts of towns. It’s flat here but with mountainous outcrops on the horizon. Here too are solar farms and windmills scattered around the towns where the obligatory church stands tall and proud although somewhat old and a little past their prime. The train has some form of wifi but the connection details are difficult to follow so I’ll type and then download when I can. Hotels and even buses have been good but the rail remain a little anachronistic. Strange as they have displays for temperature and speed that are updated constantly but... Today is a big travel day with 2 trains and a ferry but at the end we are met always good no matter where you go and taken to one of my favourite hotels in one of my favourite cities. I don’t know much about Tangiers except I like the ‘vibe’ but the El Minzah has hosted us before. Great place great breakfasts and since I saw Rick Stein talk about it I’ve wanted to visit. My other best hotel we revisit Gaudí chimneys. in Marrakech. Tangiers is that terrific blend of cultures that sees good coffee and good ice cream available in cheap cafes. Lee may suffer pastry deprivation as so much will not be gluten free but I may be charged with sampling her share as well as mine. The speed just hit 300 km/hr but I was too slow to photograph the sign. Lee now has the responsibility. Skewered meat on sticks targines spelling unctuous with fruit and veg and sweet desserts all await the eager and hungry or not tourist. We are tourists tomorrow also as we head to the ‘Blue City’ for a day trip. Both of us are looking forward to the experience as the place looks amazing and has a pretty good reputation as a destination. That’s it for a while. I like to look out the window. Kcab again. Temporary but back. The plains have been replaced by rolling hills and the olive trees by even more olive trees. Again no big surprise as although our hotel had gummy bears for breakfast there was no butter to be seen. However every table had its own bottle of olive oil as the only condiment. Our Minicipal building but lovely. paella last night was accompanied by olive oil. It’s like mother’s milk here. The train is virtually full which means little room for our suitcases. One we stowed at back in the luggage area the other above us. It means only 1 is in sight which makes me slightly uncomfortable but there’s not much I can do about it. Probably a little edgy about that as we were so often warned about pick pocketing in Barcelona there’s still a lingering legacy with me. Even in the hotel foyer our bags were moved closer to us as we sat and sipped our arrival bubbly because she was a little concerned. Apologetically she explained about Barcelona’s reputation for pick pockets and we had the same speech on each tour I did. Along with pick pockets came the gangs that sell fake brand products on La Rambla. The police raid then regularly but they disappear into the metro system only to reappear and play the same game somewhere else. Similarly the labyrinth that is the old city attracts beggars a plenty those mine artists and ‘statue’ performers and all vie for the tourist euros. We’ve stopped at Ciudad Real. It’s a larger The London gherkin? No the Barcelona gherkin. town but my map is tucked away in the case so I can tell you little more. We have less than 2 hours remaining on this train before we swap to another that should take us to Algeciras. From there to the ferry terminal is not far but from memory it’s a taxi ride because it’s impossible to cross a major freeway. Even the taxi goes in the wrong direction for a while before circling back. And I’m pretty sure we weren’t ripped off with some guise and ploy. The ferry takes about 90 minutes to cross the Mediterranean Sea near Gibraltar and deliver us to Tangiers. Most of that time I’ll spend lining up for immigration checks and passport control if last crossing is any indication of this time. Aboard the ferry will be all description of odds and ends going to the African continent. It always amazes us what people carry but I suppose if it’s scarce or unavailable it may be the only option available. We still move along magically just under the 300 km/hr mark that I want to photograph. Lots of high 290’s but always just under 300. Even the temperature has dropped a Yes it is. couple of degrees and now sits around 22. The skies have clouded over and it’s a thin greyness that greets me as I look out the windows here. Fairly regular stops punctuate the journey a couple of people disembark or embark at each stop but the carriages and there are plenty remain quite full. There are at least 3 engines pulling the train and I’d estimate at least 25 carriages. The configuration of the engines leads me to believe the train may even spilt at one of the destinations further on but I’m confident that it will be OK for us. The infrastructure that is necessitated by such a high speed line always intrigues me. What are virtually donkey tracts have engineered concrete bridges guiding them over the railway tracks or elaborate tunnels that see them disappear only to reappear on the other side. The solutions seem so disproportionate when the problem is a donkey track but not so disproportionate if the problem is viewed as a 25 carriage train travelling at close to 300 km/hr. The landscape and even the cities appear almost devoid of colour. As the buildings are built with local stone they merge with the Still yes. landscape and even the larger towns seems to have little advertising and little colour. I’m not a big fan of Shell and McDonalds but they are glaringly obviously missing here. The fast food industry has worked its magic on Barcelona as burger bars chicken and chips and Starbucks are everywhere. That’s a surprise in a city which has good food knows it has good food and prides itself on having good food. Even where we went for paella last night almost apologised for cooking it from raw ingredients as if it took too long. They even asked if I wanted the skin left on the seafood or taken off prior to cooking. Enough musings for a few moments back to looking. On board train 2. Antequera Santa Ana is strange. Super modern efficient station dotted with intriguing art works and with really helpful staff that speak that ‘little’ English which translates to more than most Australian teenagers. But it’s in the middle of nothing but olive groves. No sign of a town although there was a map that showed one but as to how far away it was that’s anyone’s guess. It’s right on departure time More yes. now so I hope I feel that gentle rhythm of the rail pretty soon as the ferry asks passengers to be there 2 hours prior to departure. We have 2.5 hours if we arrive on time minus the time it takes from station to ferry terminal. It’s not far on Google maps but as I mentioned the route is somewhat circuitous. No movement yet and that’s not a report on Lee’s toileting! Quite a few English tourists are taking this train with us. Obviously holidaying in the south of Spain and chasing that final bit of sunshine before the English winter. We’re moving. Under 10 minutes late but I think that’s OK. It’s almost exactly a 3 hour trip so hopefully that time can be made up somewhere. Whereas our last train was a monster this one is significantly more local. It’s smaller at 3 carriages and sounds very different. The conductor clipped our electronic tickets which to me seemed a clash of old and new and it sums up the transition from first train to second. As soon as we left Catalonian boundaries the announcements that were in Catalan Spanish and English no not all at once! Last one. become announcements in Spanish and English again not simultaneously and now on our little train they are just in Spanish. Fortunately Algeciras is the end of the line so not even I can miss the station. That will mark over 8 hours of train travel and you’d be forgiven for thinking we would have seen quite a bit of Spain in that time but in a way you would be mistaken. It’s as if we have seen the same bits over and over. Olive trees and olive trees with the occasional village hill top church and/or castle on some kind of endless loop. The land and villages look as if they cling desperately to anything in order to survive and I’ve seen so little movement anywhere post apocalypse thoughts can not be completely ignored. I’ve even seen an olive oil mill that been closed down and if that goes what can survive?

Not because this is the little town where Lionel Messi lives somewhere in a big hidden villa and definitely not because it is a must see in Spain. The simple reason was that in Europe it was a long spring weekend. So literally everyone was off for a city trip to Barcelona whith skyrocking prices for accomodation and food. Castelldefels is a beach town south of the airport of Barcelona and one can reach Barcelona CBD by metro within 20 minutes. And accomodation is half price compared to Barcelona. So we checked in a little simple hotel. It was nothing special but OK considering we only passed time in the room while sleeping. Castelldefels has a surprisingly nice and huge beach. The water still was too cold for swimming at least for us - but the beach looks like a nice weekend getaway for the Barcelona city crowd. But the main strip at the beach better to say the backstreet looks like a version of the Ballermann in Mallorca. It is packed with drinking holes restaurants of all types and budgets.... and it is quite crowded at view from the Monastir de Montserrat night. That was not our taste so we stayed away of the area. We even did not visit the old town of Castelldefels. We preferred other things to do. One day we spent in Barcelona. But we did not do any sightseeing at all. Our spiritual master Sri Swami Vishwananda was giving darshan in Barcelona. The event took place in a conference hall of a hotel near Passeig de Gracia - right in the middle of town. It started at 11 am. So we arrived early and spent nearly the whole day with him. It was wonderful once again. It finished at around 6pm. Afterwards we decided to look for a nice place to have dinner and to soak in the atmosphere of Barcelona. . We wandered down the busy Passeig de Gracia - it was sunday but all shops open and the city was flooded with tourists. After a peaceful wonderful day with our master these crowds of people were too much for us. Nor did we feel like shopping - we were in another mood and felt like enjoying the scenery and life. So we continued our walk towards the Barrio Gòtico which we like a Sri Swami Vishwananda and some devotees including us visiting the Basilica de Montserrat lot the last time we went to Barcelona. It was difficult to find a decent vegetarian restaurant but finally we succeeded and enjoyed a quiet nd nice dinner before we took a train back to Castelldefels. So sorry if we do not have any touristy stuff to talk about Barcelona - this is all we did in the city. Last time we visited the city back in 2011 read our blog here we liked it but it was not our favourite city in Spain. Too many tourists too many scams even though the architecture is stunning. The following day we got up early again. We had planned to visit Montserrat. Montserrat is about 50 km inland of Barcelona. From Plaza Espana there are direct trains which take about 60 minutes. Montserrat is a spectacular 1.236m-high mountain with strangely rounded rock pillars. It is a Benedictine Monestir one of Catalonias most important shrines. In fact it is the second most important pilgrimage centre in Spain after Santiago. Pilgrims come from far to venerate the Virgen de Montserrat a 12th century dark sculpture of Mary holding the infant Jesus and a globe which pilgrims come to touch. We took the train happy in Montserrat from Castelldefells to Bellvitges where we changed on train R5. We go of the station Montserrat Aeri. From there a gondola takes you to the monestir. The train was packed with people and when we arrived we decided not to wait for more than 1 hour till we can get on the gondola. We preferred to follow a sign towards a green garden near the train station saying bar. We had just had some water in the morning and we were desperately longing for a breakfast. A cafe de leche and pan de queso con tomate were exactly what we needed. We enjoyed it in a wonderful green garden overlooking the mountainous region . There were only a few locals and no tourists. It was haven and we stayed for nealry one hour. When we reached the gondola the crowds had left and we only waited for 15 minutes. What a gondola! It was built before the 2nd world war. And since then it is regularly checked and technically modernised - but the look and feel stays the same. Really a fun ride in an absolutely stunning scenery. We visited the Basilica of course enjoyed the many viewpoints over the Castelldefels valley and soaked in the atmosphere. Somehow we felt like gong for a walk a little bit - preferably we wanted to walk down to the valley. We asked at an information desk but we somehow did not get the information we needed and were a bit frustrated. We felt like being in a paradies but whatever you want to do costs extra money an other cablecar up the mountain or down the mountain - we simply could not find a solution to walk somewhere for free. Suddenly I looked around and saw some other devotees of our spiritual master. As we both know them since a while we greeted them and they told us that Sri Swami Vishwananda was about to visit the monestir with a group of pilgrims. How lucky we were! We waited with our friends for a while till finally our master arrived. We were so blessed to be able to visit the monastir again now with him. Of course we went to the Virgin Mary and finally sat down with our master for meditation in the Basilica. It was so peaceful and we were so happy to have this opportunity. We were even invited to Shopping time - a picknick with him on a terrasse overlooking the valley and the wonderful mountains. It was such a wonderful and joyful experience. And we were so incredibly happy with this unplanned surprise - a really divine surprise! We spent the whole afternoon with the group simply enjoying the presence of our master singing and dancing. In the evening we took the train down the mountain and then another train back to Barcelona and to Castedefells. What a day! We ended with a nice dinner in the beach in a quiet pizzeria well not really spanish - but we did not find another meat-or-fish-free-option. And much too fast it was already our last night in Spain for this trip. It was a short night again as we had to take the first train in the morning towards the airport. A quick last spanish breakfast on the airport and then it was a 2 hour flight back to Basilea where we had our car parked. Midday we were already back in the office working. It was a wonderful trip full of our spiritual masters spirit and love. It was on this trip that we decided that this year we will Placa de Catalunya Barcelona only travel with our spiritual master.

This is worth noting because there were a number of exotic animals kept at the temple including Red-necked Wallabies Sulcatta tortoises morbidly obese Black-tailed Prairie Dogs and quite an extensive collection of exotic waterfowl. Nothing incredibly rare but not the sort of stuff youd find commonly in a duck pond and reasonable diversity - three species of whistling ducks and four species of swans for example. Even Greater Flamingos too. The temple is on a Khlong one of the many canal things that go through Bangkok and the waterfowl enclosures are mostly entirely on the Khlong with floating wooden areas as the land area some of them also have a bit of actual land. Actually rather good enclosures decently large in both water and land areas and best of all for exotic waterfowl all were fully netted over so the birds could be fully flighted. The largest enclosure was even a walkthrough. Also at the market I had quite an interesting experience. At a fruit stall I saw some fruit that I hadnt seen or tried before White-shouldered Ibis called Langsat and also know as Longan which is confusing because thats a different tropical fruit that I have had before and also bought at this market. Langsat comes up in Google as the thing Im talking about though. They look like little potatoes and inside Theyre segmented rather like a mangosteen with lychee like flesh and a distinctive flavour. The flavour is really distinctive and nice and when I tried this mystery fruit for the first time I just couldnt place the taste. I really remembered this distinctive flavour but have no memory of ever eating the fruit. Its a really distant obscure memory and only of that flavour not anything else and it must be that Ive had that fruit before when I was very young and growing up in Thailand where I lived until I was six. A really weird distant memory of the taste only. Anyway this morning on my last day my aunt and I headed out very early for a day trip. I decided that the best thing to do would be to visit Bang Pra Lake. This is a birding site well over an hour from Bangkok but definitely a Black-necked Stork Pair day trip distance and a place I visited when I was in Thailand in April of last year and really liked. Its located extremely close to Khao Kheow Open Zoo which I also visited on that same trip to Thailand last year and is a really good zoo although having been recently I didnt feel a desperate need to go back and instead I decided to visit another place thats similarly close and that I hadnt visited before the Bang Saen Aquarium. If you didnt spend too long birding and certainly by private transport only you could do all three places in a day trip from Bangkok if you got back to the city late which I couldnt do. Bang Pra is a semi-natural lake and is a non-hunting area meaning locals can use it for various purposes including fishing but not hunt the wildlife. There is also a government run waterbird and wildlife breeding/rescue centre located here but its not open to the public and although some people have managed to get in when I tried to visit last time I was turned away. As we left early before sunrise we got to Greater Adjutant the lake just after 730 with about an hour and 45 mins drive. Soon after getting there I remembered why I like this place so much. There are large numbers of conspicuous birds everywhere and a really high diversity too. This is because of the wide variety of habitats with the open water of the very large lake marshes and reed beds along the sides grasslands and open forest and further back the surrounding hills are rainforest. This means you get a very high diversity of birds and the lake is a shallow reservoir meaning high productivity and therefore large numbers of birds. The standouts must be the large numbers of big birds storks especially that can be seen flying overhead. There are lots of Lesser Adjutant Storks which are descended from reintroductions. There are lots of prinias and bushlarks and birds like that too and I saw loads of Stork-billed Kingfishers which was surprising given I didn’t see any at all when I was in Thailand last year. And because of the forest nearby there are forest birds about too including barbets laughingthrushes and treepies and amazingly for me I found an owlet! Maybe it’s not so amazing for Openbill Storks me any more I seem to be seeing loads of owls… From the public access track you can see the edge of the wildlife breeding centre and the enclosures visible include both species of adjutant stork which is cool. Although lessers can be seen flying around Greater Adjutants are quite an unusual species. Today I noticed that the big ‘no entry’ gate was open… Well it wouldn’t hurt to go in would it. I can always claim ‘farang ignorance’ if I get told to buzz off. However it turns out that there was some kind of event happening today where a fairly large group of probably mildly important people were being guided around with various visitors with the group milling around too. The perfect opportunity to have a look around! So that’s what I did… The centre is actually really extensive from the path you can see a few waterbird breeding aviaries but it actually goes on a long way and holds a wide variety of birds and mammals as well as some reptiles. I checked out the waterbird breeding aviaries first including both species of Adjutant as mentioned as well as Asiatic Black-necked Spot-bellied Eagle-owl Stork and Sarus Cranes and most excitingly White-shouldered Ibis! I had seen some mention of the centre holding this extremely rare species and I’m very pleased to have been able to go in and have a look. They didn’t seem to have many individuals though seemingly only three with two in one aviary and a singleton in another. Continuing on from those waterbird aviaries was a large free-flight aviary that was exactly the sort of thing you’d expect to find in a proper open-to-the-public bird park although this was certainly the exception and the only enclosure that wouldn’t fit the description of decent and functional for a breeding centre” with the exception of a few small cages holding some mammals that I think/hope were temporarily separated from main groups. Further on were some more birds with a row of aviaries housing mostly pairs of hornbills of several species. There were also a few birds of prey a couple of groundbirds and some other waterbirds like Whistling Ducks and Darters. Then I got to the first bit with mammals which was several rows of aviary-type cages holding dozens and dozens of slow loris. Presumably all confiscated from the Black-shouldered Kite illegal pet trade. This then continued to the main primate area which also had a single Dusky Pademelon for some reason with a number of callitrichids a few different macaques two species of gibbon lar and Nomascus sp. Which I haven’t had a chance to look at yet and three species of langur I think dusky phayre’s and a third species that was jet black all over but with whitish on the head that I’m not sure of the species. My photocopy of the Francis field guide plates has been wrecked and I can’t see anything appropriate on google. I do have photos but in the mean time this is a horrendous picture from google of the same individual  There were also large numbers of Asian Small Clawed Otters several groups with some young ones separate and being given milk in isolated cages and various other birds dotted around. One building had quite a few parrots of different species and hundreds of tortoises of three species Radiated Indian Star and most interestingly Ploughshares. The latter comes from a confiscation at Bangkok airport from a few years ago and I had heard about them being sent to Slow Loris the Bangpra there are news articles from 2013 a about this and it seems they’re still there. As we left the centre back into the birding area it seemed like the visiting group had done a symbolic release of captive bred Lesser Adjutants Lesser Whistling Ducks and White-breasted Swamphens. I say symbolic especially for the ducks because they were released into the hunting ground of an awaiting White-bellied Sea-eagle. Quite an interesting centre and a shame that under normal circumstances it’s not open to the public because it’s a great thing to do with a birding trip and potentially also a Khao Kheow Zoo trip which is only 7kms away. After the birding and looking around the wildlife centre in the afternoon we headed down to Bang Saen which is just on the coast in order to visit the Bang Saen aquarium. This is quite an old but perfectly nice aquarium which is part of the Marine Sciences Institute of the local university and it’s worth a visit for an hour or so. The focus is local marine life and there was a very nice display of quite a few species of jellyfish. Nothing Slow Loris super-exceptional but a nice enough little aquarium and worth a visit since it fitted in well with out itinerary. We then had a late lunch at the food stalls on Bang Saen Beach and then headed back to Bangkok. I’m in a hotel tonight for my last night in Bangkok before my flight early tomorrow morning because for rather complicated reasons that I’m not going to go into here I have been evicted from where I was staying at my aunt’s house tonight. Those are the same complicated reasons that made it necessary for me to move my flight forward to tomorrow rather than three days later on Thursday as was originally planned since I didn’t feel like sitting in a hotel in Bangkok for three more days. I was going to move my flight so I’d have flown out yesterday but I was assured that I would be able to stay in my aunt’s house until tomorrow. Oh well it’s one night in a hotel which is no biggie and I fly out early first thing tomorrow morning anyway. It was definitely worth staying for that Bang Pra trip though great birding and I’m stoked to Baby Otter have been able to get into the no public access breeding centre.

He started traveling the world looking for a new home after his brother passed away leaving behind Italian sports cars a big house and an unused retirement fund. Once he died all of it went to waste no longer mattered and seemed to have been for nothing. It was Jason’s wake-up call. He stopped chasing money and instead chased peace. He found it on Bottle Beach so he stayed. I’m no Jason but I departed a normal” life in a similar fashion chasing peace and trying form my own opinions on how I should live. I still don’t have the answers but maybe that’s because life is really about the questions. Just about every writer who travels long term eventually puts out a post about things they’ve learned but for me there are many more questions than answers. As much as I’ve traveled outwardly these past two years have gone inward quite a bit as well turning my perceptions upside down and challenging everything I thought I knew. Here are 10 key questions I realized we need to ask more determined from traveling alone for the past two years 1 Why don’t I realize how rich I am? Having a roof real walls regular meals clean water the technology to read this blog a car no matter how much of a clunker it is access to a credit card or even a bank account and the ability to obtain a passport that permits entry into most countries in this world are massive luxuries that most people do not have. It’s easy to get bombarded by rich celebrity worship obsess over how to be thin or look pretty feel inadequate because the guy who just passed you on the freeway drives a Maserati or give too much importance to a Louis Vuitton purse. Every day we’re convinced that who we are and what we have isn’t good enough. Leaving the Western world and going to places where scores of people live in shacks with dirty water have no hope of ever leaving their small towns and do the same back-breaking tasks every day with very little chance of ever knowing what it’s like to worry about gaining weight put this into real perspective. Even the poorest of my circle friends which is actually probably me now is rich beyond imagination compared to the majority of people in the world. 2 Why aren’t generosity openness and compassion valued more than money and beauty? I used to think that the most important things a person could possess were money good looks and power. Now I realize that so many of those things are fake fleeting and so irrelevant and shallow that I shudder at my former definition of success. The person who selflessly helps another seeking no recognition or even thanks and manages to smile and be kind most of the time plus doesn’t turn up his nose at a new custom but remains open – he’s the one who I admire and want to spend my time with whether he has money or not. 3 Why do I always think it’s about me? It’s easy to get frustrated or feel agitated when traveling in a new country where I feel like an outsider because I don’t understand much of anything and can’t comprehend the customs. It’s even easier to get upset when I feel I’ve been cheated or a tout is too aggressive with me. I feel targeted but that’s silly because it’s really not about me. People simply want to pursue happiness instead of suffering. Maybe that means cheating me or waving me away if helping me might be too much of a hassle. Taking it personally is the wrong approach. I do believe that you get out what you put out there but I also believe how random people treat me is usually not about me. You never know what the full story is 4 Why do I forget that happiness is a choice? I’m captain of this ship” I often have to tell myself on down days. If I’m going to be sad it’s because I’m letting myself follow negative thought loops. If I’m going to be at peace it’s because I’ve mentally put myself there. It’s important to be careful where one puts his or her energy because so much of what we subconsciously think or believe shapes our day-to-day lives in ways that we often can’t see until it’s too late. I thought traveling would cure all but nothing can because there are positives and negatives that come along with every choice. Once I realized this and simply pushed out negative thoughts and refused to think of them life became a lot sweeter. 5 Can less really be more? Ever since de-complicating my life and possessing fewer things I’ve realized how much easier it has been to enjoy every moment. I for a long time used to make about 20% of the income I used to as an investment banker. It was miniscule. It means I had to eat street food stay in cheap countries and take public transport to make ends meet. It also meant I experienced more local culture ate better and loved and laughed more in my daily life. 6 Can love really last forever? A friend once said to me that all relationships ebb and flow and I realized how right he was once I started traveling leaving some of my best friends and could-have-been romantic partners behind. Yet the best friends who have always been there for me from back home still are and though our friendships have evolved over time the fact that we continue to put effort in is what makes us close. The natural state of things is to change. It’s OK if a relationship changes because that’s what life and people do. Accepting this has made life less stressful and put less pressure on my relationships. What’s real? 7 How much of perception is real? Photoshopped images only the happy moments that show up on Facebook and the acquaintances who seem to be hitting every major milestone of the magic three a master’s degree marriage and motherhood can make me feel like an utter failure at times. But there’s often so much behind the scenes that gets swept under the rug. Everyone has skeletons in her closet that she hides no matter how issue-free things appear on the surface. Comparing myself to something that isn’t even real is a recipe for disaster. As Theodore Roosevelt said comparison is the thief of joy.” 8 Why don’t I appreciate what I have achieved more? When I was a kid I envisioned myself going to the exact university I ended up attending. When I was a teenager I imagined living in Newport Beach one day and climbing the corporate ladder – something I did exactly six years later. Then I dreamed of buying a one-way ticket and traveling the world building a travel blog and having real readership. It has all happened and yet I still find ways to be dissatisfied with the present moment always wanting more. More of what though? Now I realize it’s not about once I do this I’ll be happy” point #4. It’s more about recognizing the triumphs and having pride in my accomplishments while still dreaming and acknowledging that I have and always will have future goals. When I stop and appreciate that I’ve done much of what I’ve set out to do I feel a lot better about what I haven’t yet achieved. 9 Why am I so afraid of getting older? Mark Twain said Do not complain about getting old it is a privilege denied to many.” I can’t help it. I was raised in Southern California and it’s a shallow Hollywood-impacted culture. We care a lot about our looks and how others perceive us. It has taken a long time for me to finally realize my body is a vessel and it’s the soul that makes me me. This may seem overly flowery but appreciating my health amazing life experiences and most importantly freedom are important and only afforded to me because I have survived for as long as I have. When I think about all of the things I’ve experienced in my life I realize that each year is the greatest gift I could ever have been blessed with. Not everyone makes it out of infancy childhood or their early 20s. 10 Why do I think everything I do matters so darn much? I stared up at the stars one night on a boat in Komodo and couldn’t believe how small it made me feel. It was like I couldn’t matter less in this universe. I’m just one small hiccup in millions of years in an endless abyss of particles ideas and energy. It was incredibly freeing to realize this. It was like any little mistake I make will never matter and nobody really cares anyways. Once I realized how little time anyone else devoted to thinking about me as compared to the amount of time I thought people spent judging me I realized I was free. I can do anything I want because every little thing I do as long as it doesn’t hurt someone else has almost no impact in the long-term. A few centuries from now it’ll be as if I didn’t even exist. This isn’t depressing. Quite the opposite – it’s liberating! The small stuff is not a big deal and little mistakes are meant to be made. In closing there are a lot of things I learned from two years of traveling like becoming my own boss and spending most of the year in places completely foreign to me. Chief among them is to never stop asking questions wondering and of course wandering. Join over 30000 monthly readers!

Reply Christina T Zchyn says 09/12/2014 at 837 am Great reflection  I adore your courage ! This article is so inspired = Look forward more upcoming travel share . Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 1002 am Thanks so much Christina. It appears you’ve had amazing travels as well! I’d love to see Tibet. Reply Franca says 09/12/2014 at 1129 am Once more Kristin you are inspiring others to take the courage of fighting any fear and finally leave the comfort zone. People need to know how enriching travelling can be but they also need to know everything else that comes with it nothing is always easy and straight forward. Best wishes and more years of nomadic adventures to come 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 129 pm Aw thank you Franca. Reply Jeremy says 09/12/2014 at 131 pm Seriously AMEN to everything on this list. Looking forward to crossing paths with you someday! Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 307 pm Feels weird to me that we haven’t met IRL because it seems like we have! Reply KMunoz says 09/12/2014 at 157 pm This is my first time on your site and what a post to welcome me! I loved everything about this. Thanks for sharing these beautiful observations. Reply Kristin says 09/12/2014 at 307 pm Welcome! I’m glad you enjoyed it! Reply Anonymous says 09/12/2014 at 555 pm Kristin you are so inspiring ! Keep writing !! Reply Evran says 09/13/2014 at 653 am Kristin how nice you have realised that facts and also shared with us with your beautifully fluent and inspiring writing. Reply Kristin says 09/13/2014 at 1119 am Haha beautifully fluent. German is next! 😉 Reply Kaleenas Kaleidoscope says 09/13/2014 at 737 am Great questions! I particularly relate to #8. I think it’s a trap that people like us with ambitious perfectionistic tendencies tend to fall into. I have to constantly remind myself that by living abroad I AM living what I used to dream of even though right now I catch myself feeling like I’m not accomplishing much. And it’s true–I’m totally afraid of aging now when I know I shouldn’t. But these wrinkles–they’re really setting in! haha. Lovely post. 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/13/2014 at 1118 am It’s definitely a trap but also part of our culture so it’s a hard thing to shake. I agree with the wrinkles and every time I see a new one I’m like noooo!” but it’s inevitable so the two choices are to embrace it or fight it and the latter battle isn’t one I want to wage. Reply Rika | Cubicle Throwdown says 09/13/2014 at 1050 am Wonderful post Kristin! Love how you framed it with questions. Very insightful! Reply Rachel of Hippie in Heels says 09/14/2014 at 353 am I really enjoyed reading this. Number 7 is one I struggle with. Actually I think in blogging it becomes a competition sometimes so adding that on top of personal life is a lot of comparison that I can’t help making. Before I travel blogged and worked as a nurse I wasn’t ever wondering if someone was a better nurse than me- but choosing a job of writing in a public space has changed a lot. Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 927 am I agree that in that regard I always feel inferior but then I look at the people who have larger readerships and they have definitely been around for longer and longevity has a lot to do with success. Working more and more and more are what lead to success in just about any field I can think of. Experience is what you need. Isn’t easy but it’s a journey and a great one once you start to see it paying dividends. Reply Katie Featherstone says 09/14/2014 at 458 pm The main thing I take away from travelling is that life is just whatever you make it. Travel just means we can leave all the mundane behind and try and find something new and exciting- like you said you make your own happiness. Thought provoking post thank-you. Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 824 pm Very true. Reply Kristin says 09/14/2014 at 824 pm Gratitude is huge and compassion. Those two are major for me. Reply Silvia says 09/15/2014 at 324 am This are such great questions to raise! I tell myself that I’ve broken free by deciding to travel and write instead of pursuing a normal” career but in many ways I’ve just attached myself to a new set of standards set by travelers and travel bloggers. It’s important to step back sometimes and reassess my priorities. Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 820 am That’s such a good point. You leave one routine but inevitably pick up another. Just has to be all well in your heart. Reply Chris A Sharpe says 09/15/2014 at 925 am A touching analysis of the things we all think when travelling a long time but are too afraid to talk about. The questions you ask are tough and can only really be understood through experience. Everyone at one point in their life will have been guilty having these thoughts doubts and fears opening up and breaking down these misconceptions is something to be applauded. Excellent use of a Mark Twain quote as well a personal fave Do not complain about getting old it is a privilege denied to many.” Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 951 am That quote was big for me once I discovered it and really put things into perspective. Why are we so afraid of getting old? I guess for most it feels closer to death but that could happen any time. Reply Abi says 09/15/2014 at 939 am So glad you pointed out number one…If only more people could realise! Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 950 am I think it takes traveling to realize. Leaving your bubble is so important and most people never do. Reply Ayngelina says 09/15/2014 at 1214 pm I don’t think travel ever solves these questions but maybe makes us feel more comfortable that we don’t know the answers. Or maybe the older I get the less I need to feel like I have everything under control. Don’t fear age I’m happier each year. Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 123 pm I also wonder if it’s just maturity or travel that has helped me feel less worried about not having the answers. I’m sure it’s a combination of both but traveling was definitely a catalyst. Reply Abby says 09/15/2014 at 129 pm Our society almost makes us feel guilty for being content I know I should be happy but…” Beautiful beautiful post. Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 150 pm So very true. It’s like saying I don’t want anything more and I’m happy with this” feels arrogant but why should it be? Thank you Abby 🙂 Reply Alana - Paper Planes says 09/15/2014 at 957 pm I loved reading this Kristin and have many of the same nagging questions. While traveling has opened up my world in wonderful ways and made me more comfortable in some truths in reality it’s made me question things more and become even less sure of things than I was before I left home… Reply Kristin says 09/15/2014 at 1105 pm So true. I question a lot more but I think that’s a good thing. Reply Alex says 09/19/2014 at 1239 am Wow Kristin I can’t tell you how much I love this post. I’ve come back to it and reread it a few times now! I’m going to keep a lot of these questions in mind for my own self reflection. I found myself saying I am the captain of this ship” when I woke up to some unpleasant thoughts this morning! Love love love. Reply Kristin says 09/19/2014 at 900 am That’s wonderful! I’m so glad it made a positive impact. Thanks for the amazing comment <3 Reply Angie Away says 09/19/2014 at 758 am Awesome post! Thought-provoking! Traveling has certainly made me ask a lot of these same questions — and even though I continually come back to the same answers I find myself getting caught up in the non-important stuff over and over. It’s great to be reminded of the big lessons I learned while on the road full time so thank you! Reply Rekha Devarapalli says 09/19/2014 at 905 am Beautifully written Kristin!! Reply Jess says 09/19/2014 at 1058 am Wow – you have just summarised everything I’ve been thinking and feeling for the past 6 months. That’s why I so love reading these blogs. I’ve just moved to Thailand for two years it’s been my plan for 5 years. Now I’m so happy but the first few weeks I was like – ok what next?! Enjoy the moment is the best advice I’ve given myself 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/19/2014 at 1116 am Good for you! Thailand is awesome. Reply Laura says 09/19/2014 at 939 pm Very though-provoking. Number 4 is a big one for me especially when getting pulled into the sometimes drama of daily read work concerns. Reply Kristin says 09/20/2014 at 1219 pm It’s hard to remember to just push bad thoughts out but when I can do so effectively it’s a big help. Reply Simone says 09/20/2014 at 241 am This has to be one of my favourite and most thought provoking posts of yours! You’ve given me a lot of food for thought 🙂 Reply Kristin says 09/20/2014 at 1218 pm Yay! The good response on this has led me to write more similar posts. Reply Camels & Chocolate says 09/23/2014 at 857 am YES to all of these but especially NUMBERS THREE and TEN. This is so thought-provoking and lovely. Enjoyed reading it! Reply Kristin says 09/23/2014 at 915 am I’m glad you enjoyed! Reply Joyce says 09/23/2014 at 1204 pm I love how travel changed your perspective. Thanks for sharing I always love to hear other people’s stories and lessons learned. Reply Kristin says 09/23/2014 at 1256 pm I do as well. I always find those kinds of posts to be very uplifting. Reply Mary says 10/18/2014 at 605 am Bravo! What a brilliant philosophy you have developed through your travelling. Mine is similar! As a 75 year old wrinkley who still loves solo travel let me reassure you that wrinkles don’t matter a jot. In fact I believe they have become an advantage while I am travelling the world! Thank you for a great read. I found your site through Nomadic Matt. May your journey throughout the world continue to bring you many more joys with no troubles. Mary. Reply Kristin says 10/18/2014 at 345 pm Thanks Mary! Really nice to have your thoughts on the beauty of aging and traveling solo at 75! My grandmother traveled a lot as well and I always looked up to her for that among many other reasons. Reply Anne says 11/07/2014 at 927 pm Beautifully stated. Everything! We have just been just” on the road for 10 months and I can genuinely relate to these questions. And to your point about how much of perception is real. It goes both ways. I post pictures and send my friends and family pictures of all the FUN things we do… but there are also the very REAL moments of long term travel like this that aren’t so glamorous that don’t often get told. 🙂 I know you can relate to that too! Keep doing what you’re doing… I think you’re amazing! Reply Kristin says 11/09/2014 at 1154 am Thanks Anne 🙂 I’ve written posts from time to time about the non glamorous side but it’s hard to understand until you go right? Otherwise it just sounds like griping about an otherwise awesome lifestyle. Lots of REAL moments traveling that’s for sure. Reply ChasinJason13 says 11/11/2014 at 1054 am #11- Why in the hell did I think that what I wanted or even thought I wanted before I went to would be the same things I wanted when I returned? What did I think going on adventures of a lifetime would just cement in me that everything I was doing before was right on the money? You know it’s cliche these days to say that you’re going traveling to find yourself” but I for one have found much more of myself out there -wherever there” may be- than I ever have at home. Reply Kristin says 11/11/2014 at 1137 am I have as well and honestly I think traveling does help you find your true self – without the influences values and judgements affecting your decisions like they did when surrounded by a certain type of society friends and family. No matter how well-meaning we affect each other’s decisions. Once you’re on your own exploring the world you start to realize how capable you were all along of making your choices on your own. It’s pretty cool. Reply Alex B says 11/13/2014 at 731 pm I love this so much! I’m bookmarking this under my Inspiration for when I get down on the road” folder 😉 Reply Kristin says 11/14/2014 at 323 am Aw thanks and that’s a really good idea to keep something like that. I think this one is really good to stick in there too http//zenpencils.com/comic/98-alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object/ Reply Martina Donkers says 11/18/2014 at 652 pm Hey Kristin 🙂 This is such a beautiful post and an affirmation to life. It’s so important to remember what we have how privileged we are in our travels and how much of the world there is to explore. Martina 🙂 Reply Kristin says 11/19/2014 at 411 am Thanks Martina. Agreed 🙂 Reply Navraj says 07/08/2017 at 842 am You get a perfect ten for your thoughts! But like you said about relationships it’s true of ourselves too. Feelings and emotions also keep ebbing and flowing. The key is to remain centered by being in harmony & balance with all our surroundings and most importantly with ourselves. Happiness is our choice our responsibility to ourselves. I have observed that it’s not bad that relationships change. Those which help each other grow and experience life in a much deeper & more meaningful way tend to flourish. Life is beautiful and we need to disconnect the thought that happiness depends on getting something or someone. Keep on! God speed!

During this period of time I have rarely spent more than a few days in each place and never stayed anywhere for more than two months the longest was my most recent summer in Berlin. I also rarely spent longer than a few days in any one individual’s company with a few exceptions. Pin me! Solo traveling is something I’ve advocated ever since I began traveling and while I still believe it has all kinds of positive benefits I acknowledge that any kind of radical life shift especially one maintained over a long period of time will also come with drawbacks. While traveling has taught me more over the past two years about the world than I could ever have hoped to learn without that kind of exposure to other cultures and belief systems it has also taught me a lot about the world within. Here are 10 ways that traveling has changed me and inevitably tends to change everyone in a similar situation 1 It breeds selfishness Solo traveling narrows down the direct impact of nearly every choice to one person – you. Decisions answering the smaller questions like what should I eat today?” to the larger ones like which country would I like to visit next?” all fall to you.. Unless you’ve met a persons you want to remain with longer or are making a more major decision like whether or not to go home for an important holiday or life event the vast majority of what you do is governed and experienced by you and you alone. This can make it pretty hard to commit to any kind of relationship because suddenly you have to start considering the desires of others and can’t be as selfish anymore. 2 It removes filters and exposes you to your real self Traveling solo particularly in developing countries removes most external influences that caused us to make decisions in our lives back home jobs relationships rent costs image ads television etc. When you’re in places where nobody wears designer anything a $3 dorm room is perfectly normal and street food is a favorite staple even for those who also come from a corporate background the B.S. is removed and people can be who they want to be. People say that traveling makes them into a new person but I believe it just allows them to be who they’ve always been. Maybe that’s someone who freely enjoys excess turns into a Buddhist devotes his/her life to helping others or a whole host of other lifestyles. 3 You realize you can actually do whatever you want All it takes sometimes! So many people say to me I wish I could do what you do” or you’re so brave” but what they don’t realize is they can do what I’m doing and I’m not that brave. Anyone traveling solo also knows this to be true. What seems so simple to me now but I didn’t put enough emphasis on before is the fact that we get only one shot at life and pursuing major dreams is not just important it’s a necessity. Yet so many people don’t end up trying the very thing they most wish they could in life for fear of failure. The whole point is to realize it’s never a failure but a series of steps forward and inevitably a few backwards. 4 Your profound realizations will make you sound like an a**hole Any time someone praises you for following your dreams you’ll be forced to tell them they could do the same thing. They too could simply do whatever the heck they want. They’ll stare back at you in disbelief and you’ll feel like you’re on a soap box. Then you’ll step down sheepishly. 5 Friends and family become much more precious My mom says that these days she sees me more than when I was living in California only 45 minutes away. Now when I come home I stay with her and each year she has visited me for a week or two during my travels. My best friends from back home also take time off of work and plan group trips when I’m home. A couple of them have even visited me in Thailand during the coup d’etat no less. I’ve also seen friends I’ve met traveling over and over in different countries and continents. We make effort to see each other because we made lasting friendships. You’ll meet people from all over the world and while you’ll say goodbye a lot you’ll also have the opportunity to hang out with a friend in just about every city you visit. This is an incredible gift. 6 People will rely on you less By juxtaposition the fact that you’re always leaving always moving and never letting yourself stay in one place for long will make you less of a long-term prospect in many people’s lives. This is particularly true for romantic relationships. It’s hard to take someone seriously who will always leave which results in a lot of heartbreak and goodbyes. 7 There’s no cure-all no perfect lifestyle and no answer to all of your problems People think riches are the answer until they become rich think fame is the answer until they become famous and think traveling will be the perfect lifestyle change until they realize that no lifestyle is without its pitfalls. It can be a bitter pill to swallow. 8 Home will be harder to find With so many options constantly presenting themselves and by returning to the place where you grew up with a new perspective it will be harder to feel at home in any one place. This inevitable byproduct of traveling is a double-edged sword because you’ll end up falling in love with many places while simultaneously wondering if you could ever really settle in one place. 9 If you can’t be a chameleon it won’t be easy Master the art of blending in! Unless you can embrace the differences in each friend group culture and overall lifestyle where you’re living it won’t be an easy road. When I’m traveling I realize that things will not be as clean timetables will probably not exist and the people I’m around will more likely be from different cultures with very little in common with how I grew up. Back home I realize that image matters more and I can’t just walk around without makeup or western-style clothing on if I want to be treated with respect. Traveling successfully means that in order to fit in and appreciate each place you have to change a little bit each time. Some would say this means not being true to yourself but in reality it’s just letting different parts of your personality show. 10 You’ll never be the same again Normalcy will be almost impossible to grasp. Reverse culture shock will be real. Assimilating to the world of non-travelers should you ever decide to become one again will be more difficult than you ever imagined. In closing traveling opens a lot of doors promotes the opportunity to have amazing and eye-opening experiences in beautiful places and exposes you to all kinds of amazing people. It also means a lot of changes to your lifestyle and sense of self. Like anything it can be both good and bad. All that said I wouldn’t trade it for the world. How has traveling changed you?

Another one I would add is that everything at home will seem the same- it will feel like you’ve changed a ton but everyone back home is frozen in place. At least for me. Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 257 pm Definitely. Somehow it all seems the same yet everything changes. Reply Charlie says 10/20/2014 at 115 pm Hells yes. Many of these ring true to me from years as an expat especially #5 #6 and #9. Travelling or more living in different countries in my case has made me more confident stronger and know myself better but I expect and hope to find more of #2 and #3 within myself on my RTW trip in January. Great post! Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 255 pm RTW trips are amazing. Have a blast girl! Reply Kristin says 10/20/2014 at 258 pm I really struggle with it too. Finding Berlin has helped but I know I’m at the mercy of the people at the visa office so it’s just not a 100% viable option. Best of luck with you search 🙂 Reply Ashton says 10/20/2014 at 652 pm Hey Kristin always cool to see how travel affects others. I’m sure we’ll cross paths somewhere in the world. Best to you! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 802 am …and to you! Reply Christie says 10/21/2014 at 215 am This is such a great list. Although I am not travelling solo so many of these resonate with me. Particularly #1 I’m learning that I can be really selfish when travelling with my partner and its totally something I need to work on! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 802 am I do as well! Reply Franca says 10/21/2014 at 503 am It’s so true that once you start travelling it’s hard to think at a particular place as home at least it is for me. Me and Dale have been on the road for more than 2 years with no intention to stop any time soon but we would like to have a base where we can return to the problem is where? Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 801 am I have a few places that could be a base at least I think so. Testing my theory! Reply Kristin says 10/21/2014 at 800 am I love that about it too. The way it presents challenges but also builds the kind of person who can overcome them. Reply Megan says 10/21/2014 at 557 pm I was going to list the points that jumped out at me but then I realised that would be all ten! Although I’ve had some personal experience with #4 lately. Opps. I was about the send the link to a friend who’s in the should I travel or shouldn’t I” boat so she know’s just what’s in store and how awesome it is but I think only people who have experienced this themselves really understand. Reply Kristin says 10/24/2014 at 943 am She definitely should do it! Reply Nichelle says 10/23/2014 at 604 am Great post! There are really good changes and not so good ones about long-term travel. But at the end of the day it’s you who decide how you are gonna react with those changes. Reply Kristin says 10/24/2014 at 937 am Definitely Reply Sand In My Suitcase says 10/23/2014 at 835 am So true about how friends and family become more and more important – they ground us -. We find that each time we return from a trip we examine our daily lives back home and try to make some personal changes that would make us happier e.g. after Europe do we want to live right in the city where we can walk everywhere rather than someplace where we need a car? Reply Fabiana says 10/24/2014 at 545 pm Great post! I might do a similar one on my blog. Reply Rose says 10/25/2014 at 423 pm Hello Kristin! I’ve been following your blog and it’s been incredibly inspiring. I have a question I noticed earlier on in your blogging career you used a pseudonym called Ava Apollo. What was the reason behind this and why did you decide to go back to your real name? Thank you! Reply Renuka says 10/26/2014 at 317 am Nice read! Travel definitely brings a positive change in an individual. In my case it has made me more tolerant of life. I have learnt to value life more value people more. I have learnt to be less emotional and more practical. 🙂 Most of all I have become a better person. Reply Kristin says 10/26/2014 at 432 am I really agree with that a lot. I have more compassion and more easily tolerate others who might slightly annoy me without meaning to. Reply Stephen & Jess says 10/26/2014 at 547 am Great post – thanks for sharing you stories. Do you ever find that sharing too many stories of travel with friends can lead to an almost ‘boasting’ feel? Even though you aren’t purposely trying to boast and instead just wanting to share your stories. Btw just talking generally – not pointed at anyone in anyway  Reply Kristin says 10/26/2014 at 608 am I guess that’s why I kept this blog in the first place because those who want to know will come here to read it and those who don’t aren’t obliged to hear my stories. I find that those who are genuinely curious will ask specific questions and those who aren’t will just say things like how was your trip?” and all they really want to hear is it was good.” Reply Stephen & Jess says 10/27/2014 at 310 am That’s so true totally agree with you and I think that is why we started our blog. Never thought about the whole ‘how was your trip’ thing. Reply Lily Lau says 10/29/2014 at 1229 pm You’re right… it’s incredible how travelling changes you so much until making you a complete different person. Even the loved ones change and you consider others your family. That’s sad for the ones who stay home and see how others could achieve in days what they had to work for years and years of friendship and patience. It’s unfair but true. Nice post. Reply Kristin says 10/29/2014 at 239 pm I definitely grew a lot more this year and learned how to let go but there are probably also things where I took a step backwards since the nature of relationships changes when moving around so quickly. It’s an interesting concept and I am learning more about myself all the time as a result. Reply Oliver says 11/02/2014 at 433 am I really like your blog and especially this article motivates a lot! Someday I’ll give it a try for myself. Keep it up! I just hope you dont turn into a loner 🙂 The pink suit guy Reply Kristin says 11/02/2014 at 437 am It’s impossible to be a loner when you have friends all over the world 🙂 Thanks for the kind words. Reply Katie says 11/02/2014 at 645 pm It has definitely made me more confident and I noticed it when I went home for the 1st time. Making all those decisions instead of letting others do it for me made me a lot more comfortable with the prospect of dealing with the outcomes which were not as scary as I had initially thought. Reply Kristin says 11/03/2014 at 1254 am That’s so true. Knowing that you’re in charge makes it less scary even though it seems like the opposite would be true. Reply Ryan Biddulph says 11/04/2014 at 428 pm Hi Kristin I went from shy struggling largely not too happy guy to someone who’ll be speaking at NYU in a month. I went from unknown blogger to a guy whose eBooks have been endorsed by a New York Times Best Selling Author. Your post is spot on and I know first hand that traveling changes your life like you couldn’t believe! Nobody knows how travel will change them but if you’re open and willing to be uncomfortable you’ll slowly free yourself. You’ll become who you were born to be because you’ll stop being the person your friends and fam want you to be and you’ll be you. At home in NJ I was Ryan the office worker then Ryan the pier guard who watches sports and hangs out on the weekends. Traveling all over the world my ego view of self was shattered. I became who my intuition told me to be which is why I’ll be speaking at NYU teaching folks how to live the digital nomad lifestyle and it’s also why I’ve received the humbling endorsements from a world renowned author and biz coach. LOVING each of your points Kristin. Tweeting this from Bali 😉 Thanks for sharing! Ryan Reply Kristin says 11/05/2014 at 502 am That’s awesome Ryan! I completely agree that without external influences from people who have always been in your life you suddenly shed the fear of being yourself which is wonderful and essential. Enjoy Bali 🙂 Reply Dana Wanted Adventure says 11/24/2014 at 721 am I could relate to several of these but especially number 8! I always try to explain that I live in this limbo-life where no matter where I am I’m missing my other” home somewhere out there in the world and when I’m at one of those homes I’m at the way time missing not traveling around somewhere! lol Reply Kristin says 11/24/2014 at 745 am Totally! you leave pieces of yourself behind everywhere. It’s the beauty of having home everywhere but the difficulty of not really feeling at home anywhere.

The brave women who stepped forward this week to speak out about sexual assault reminded me that by not hiding we stand up for ourselves and for others too. We say that we won’t protect our abusers anymore or accept a system that keeps us down by pretending it didn’t happen. I have something to share too. There is a deeper stronger reason why I’m so passionate about women traveling alone. It healed me. Part of my story includes sexual abuse as a child. I still struggle to overcome the lack of trust it instilled in me the steadfast belief that I did not deserve love and that the things that mattered to me would always leave. It robbed me of normal teenage years if ‘normal’ is even possible for a teen? and the resulting trauma has ruined every single romantic relationship of mine. For the longest time I was so afraid to tell you this. I had shame. I worried that I’d invite judgement. I feared I’d just look broken like I was complaining or that I was seeking pity. Now I am realizing that I have to speak out because by staying silent I’m quietly communicating that it’s okay or that it’s something that I should hide. So here it is. I’m not hiding anymore. I admit sometimes I feel so angry at my abuser I just think of ways that I can get revenge. I know enough about SEO at this point to make sure his name and ‘pedophile’ show up together on Google I could spend hours days months toiling away at this and making sure that I hurt him back. The court documents are public though the justice system largely failed me as well. But hate is a poison that only harms me. And revenge is a sword that cuts me the deepest. That’s not what this blog is for. My only choices are to rise above or to sink down to depths darker than the inside of a cave – cold wet uncaring and unforgiving. Then who dies? Then who loses? Stronger now Traveling alone is what showed me that people are good again. I was scared to do it but it was a gift I finally insisted I had to give myself. It was an act that many would call selfish. To those whose families and friends try to guilt or scare them out of going around the world solo I’m sure you know what I mean when I say that it was selfish. And you know what? Fine. I deserved to do it and so do you. Traveling the world showed me that people including men are not all cruel and abusive. They are for the most part unbelievably kind and giving. Every time that something seemed hopeless – I was lost it was the middle of the night I had nowhere to go – someone showed up and helped me. Every single time. I thought I had just been lucky so far. I figured eventually it would run out. Then my friend Caspar expressed the same thing one Thanksgiving when we all shared what we were thankful for. He shared that in the eleventh hour there has always been someone there that he is never truly alone. In that moment all the hair on the back of my neck stood up because I finally knew it wasn’t just dumb luck. For all of the horrible stories where it didn’t work out which are so few and far between there is such a wealth of kindness and generosity that it doesn’t get attention because it would fill volumes and volumes of newspapers and we would spend all of our time reading because there would be too much good news. We made it we’ll always make it. The world is more good than bad. I know that because I went out to see it. I know that because I was alone and people took a special interest in caring for me showing me around being good hosts friends and human beings. They were shepherds because they saw something in me that they liked – the spunk that it took to go it alone the burning need to be healed the last-ditch effort to try to love the world again. People who have never tried it don’t get it. They ask aren’t you scared?” Isn’t it dangerous?” Aren’t you worried that something will happen?” Excuse the F bomb but are you fucking kidding me? Worse than what happens in the schools we attend the industry that victimizes women so that they can have a job the dates we go on that end in date rape? The patriarchy telling me that it’s not safe for me to go out and chart my own course? That I would be better off staying at home where people can’t even go to school or the movies or a concert without wondering if they’ll be next? What the fuck? Seriously what the fuck? You must have no clue what real fear is. That’s what I want to say but I know that they are really asking because they’re scared too. We all have something to heal from. We’ve all been made victims of this system. I also cannot emphasize enough that men as a whole are not the problem. I am not here to demonize them. I believe that we all have parts of the masculine and feminine in us – do we women not have testosterone running through us too? Men did you not grow inside of a woman? We have to love all of our parts and see humanity as a whole or we’re doomed. It’s when we hate something about ourselves so much that we act out and harm others that things go wrong. No men are not the problem. The society that created such a sick and twisted power struggle that is the problem. Thank you to all of the women who have spoken out not just this week but all throughout history. When we all add up our voices we get louder. So loud that we can’t be ignored. Change is happening because we’re not ashamed anymore. Traveling the world by myself finding out what I’m made of – that I’m capable brave enough resourceful enough smart enough and powerful enough healed me in ways I never could have otherwise. It made me trust again. So if someone asks you if you’re scared or tells you it’s too dangerous for you just laugh a little bit to yourself. They’re the ones who are scared. And you are here to show the truth. That you are strong. That you will do this. To anyone who wants to share her story I open up the comments to you as a forum. I’m here for you.

Comments Ijana says 10/15/2017 at 819 am Thank you so much for sharing this your writing is just beautiful and I’m glad you finally decided to use it to express this part of your story ❤️ You have done so many people a favor with this post by showing that you are a normal person just like them that nobody is alone. Traveling is a wonderful way to re-open yourself to the idea of trusting people. That’s basically what I did too I was assaulted still hard to use the r word when I was 18 and have gone on to travel and completely restore my faith in people. I mentioned all the people that you helped with this article but know that you did for sure at least help me 🙂 I consider myself quite well adjusted but reading this I felt all warm and fuzzy in knowing the fact that I’m not the only one. Keep meeting new awesome people and trusting in the world! 😀 Reply Vianessa says 10/15/2017 at 832 am Thanks for writing this touching and relatable post. It’s interesting I rarely think of myself as a solo traveler because I find a community and make friends wherever I go so I never really feel alone except when I choose to be. Reply Image Earth Travel says 10/15/2017 at 934 am Travelling is an excellent healer. Reply Emily says 10/15/2017 at 1038 am Thank you so much for this. Like you said this act of bravery on your part will show so many other women that they aren’t alone. I worked as a sexual assault nurse at my local ER and every patient I took care of found some way to make it her fault” or some reason that what happened didn’t really count” as assault. It’s heartbreaking. We need to hear each other’s stories so that we know it’s ok to stand up for ourselves so thank you for sharing yours. And yes after seeing this crap go on every day in my home city when people tell me I should be afraid to travel – I just laugh and shake my head. Reply Jessica says 10/15/2017 at 1050 am Thank you for bringing this up and putting yourself in such a vulnerable position. I’m sure it wasn’t easy to write this post and I applaude you. I just got back from a solo trip in Peru today and my family and friends didn’t understand why I had to go”. I was in a similar situation at the beginning of this year and it really changed me. I was made to feel powerless and worthless. I didn’t understand why but traveling made my faith in humanity come back. I felt so independent and my power came back to me. Your words were extremely touching and it made me feel so comforted to know I’m not the only one who feels this way. Like you said if you haven’t done it you really don’t get it and it can be a lonely feeling. Thank you again for sharing! Reply Babi Cady says 10/15/2017 at 1108 am Thanks for sharing and for speaking up. It’s important for women to know that we are not alone and also the importance of traveling solo. Traveling solo it’s empowering and I will always support any other woman to go out alone to find out that you are never alone because the world is full of nice people ready to help you! Keep sharing your experiences it’s very important for women empowerment! Reply Amanda Andersen says 10/15/2017 at 1122 am I love this post. Thank you! Reply Chiara says 10/15/2017 at 1143 am Thank you for bringing this up and sharing your story. It must be tough but your contribution may be really helpful to other women. The title ‘Ladies Take Back Your Power’ is so powerful. Reply Charmaine says 10/15/2017 at 1232 pm It is an act of bravery to speak out. My hat goes off to you. What you said about travel is so true. I have traveled by myself 90% of the time and the funny thing is I was never really alone. Every Christmas I spent away from home I had more things to do than when I am in my home country. I always get the same questions arent you afraid? To be quite honest the first time i traveled by myself i was afraid but the fear quickly disappeared and was replaced by awe. For me travel is when I really feel alive. I have really enjoyed your blog. Continue being brave and fearless! Reply GG says 10/15/2017 at 204 pm Appreciate the courage you have to share such deep and painful experiences and it is so wonderful how the traveling and this blog has helped so many others as well as provide you healing by being able to express it openly and know that everyone here supports what you are doing. Hell we hope through this you are replacing shame with pride we are proud of you pity with awe you are awesome fear with power. We know how you have gone from broken to whole through the traveling solo experience this blog your business writing etc. I hope to learn from this to help me be whole too. I also can express how open-hearted” not just minded about not turning blame on a whole group of people or simplifying the problem. It indeed reflective of the society that condones it not necessarily male vs. female and really awesome how through your experiences that indeed that in many ways it isn’t masculine vs. feminine that it really is a spectrum as viewed in many Eastern cultures where we have both. However the cultures that condoned or even encouraged this behavior have been male run or dominated so we males have to own up to it. There are so many places in the world where this is an issue. Men and women need each other while we are not literally equal we need to treat each other as equals and appreciate what each unique person brings to the table. I agree that most people are generally good” and will help others in need in a heartbeat. It is great Kristin that you were able to see this through your experiences. It is easy to get caught up in the negativity. Unfortunately forgive me for getting less than positive here it only takes a few to ruin the party so easy to destroy than to build. These few get all the press! You are correct if you added up all the good deeds people did there would be no room for the bad news even if bad news sells 🙁 although not here!. I think a lot of the problems regarding abuse and violence is tied to issues of emotional psychological and mental health. I pray that progress is made in the U.S. and everywhere that addresses the pain anxiety mental imbalance and depression that affects so many and leads to them to hurt others themselves and loved ones lack empathy and lead to violence and cyber-wars. There are also those with mental issues who are manipulative yet very charismatic and use religion and nationalism to push his/her agenda and know how to press others’ buttons to get them to act in ways they wouldn’t otherwise. Then there are those who feel very lowly of him or herself and if you don’t value your own life then how about anybody else? same goes with those who look to the afterlife too much. Additional problems involve what happens to people when given the opportunity to have total power over someone else whether in the family unit or in a business military or sports team etc. Think about what happens when you don’t have control like how one behaves when driving especially in heavy traffic? I think we need for everyone not those who are clinically” compromised a mental checkup” is in order especially in a world like today where there is so much going so fast and furious traveling in isolation and letting go are great therapy for this clearly!!!. I think that would help a lot. Religion can be of use here too think how it impacted guys like George Foreman and Muhammed Ali  then there is Susan B. Anthony where Quakers believed in equal rights of men and women. Lastly we revisit the concept of selfishness”. Taking a different angle this go around if you are selfish” where it helps you be a better person and in turn help others like in your case Kristin that is good selfish”. I think you can’t be good to others if not good to yourself so even when you do something for yourself and it does not hurt anybody else is also good”. It is bound to help others in the long run. I think when others you care for who can do it themselves don’t appreciate what you have done for them and use the selfish” term should look in the mirror. However you hit on an important point where selfishness” puts yourself ahead of others. When one thinks that the purpose in life is to get as much out of it for you before you die and the heck with others or if the strong” and clever” should flourish and the weak” should not we have a problem and the core to many of the worlds problems beyond the mental health issue. As human beings and looking at our history the societies that at their time were the most advanced and enduring were the ones where strength” and cleverness” aligned with working together using mental resources and diversity advancing freedom justice and compassion for the time do note. We were made with frail bodies provided with strong minds and designed to be social to work together. However things or people don’t always run as they were designed but we need to remember the original specs. This is whole topic of selfishness” is near and dear to me also personally but might get to that at another point…. Reply GG says 10/15/2017 at 932 pm Let me restate part of one of the paragraphs I kind of lost focus on it I can’t possibly fully express how open-hearted” not just minded you are being about not turning blame on a whole group of people or simplifying the problem regarding a culture of abuse. It is indeed reflective of a society that condones it not simply a male vs. female problem. It really is awesome how through your experiences with Eastern cultures/philosophy I am assuming correct me if I am wrong that indeed in many ways it isn’t just all masculine or all feminine that it really is a spectrum where we have at least some level of the other. Reply Anonymous says 10/15/2017 at 236 pm This is a very powerful post thank you for sharing. Reply Lin says 10/15/2017 at 433 pm Thank you Kristin. The world needs to hear more of this. Reply Meera C. says 10/15/2017 at 442 pm Thank you. I don’t think I ever considered my past with trauma to be part of my drive to travel. I haven’t yet reached the point in my life where I get to buy that ticket and go but I’m working towards it everyday. I always thought my need to travel was just about me and never really considered traveling alone might help rekindle my trust in people. When someone changes you on such a fundamental level it can be hard to see the path back to yourself. But your blog has inspired me to chase my dreams and seek the adventures I’ve always been searching for. Thank you for sharing your story. It really has helped me see a little bit deeper into myself. You are my hero. Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1218 am Hi Meera Thanks for your comment. I know it takes a mountain of courage just to even speak openly about what happened for most of us let alone write it down. This right here is another huge step forward for you. Another thing I learned is the importance of taking my time and being gentle with myself. You’ll buy that ticket when you’re ready <3 Reply Nikki says 10/15/2017 at 557 pm Kristin!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Reply Caspar says 10/15/2017 at 831 pm Wow Kristin I just want to start by congratulating you on deciding to write about this openly. I cannot imagine what it must be like but it’s clear from the comments that you’ve done enormous good by sharing your experience honestly and fearlessly. I’m honoured to have played a minor role in your evolution in thinking about humanity. It was a beautiful moment to share with you and the others there that night and I reflect on it often. I can’t wait to cross paths again! Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1224 am I look forward to that as well Caspar! Thanks for noticing this and leaving your thoughts and light <3 Reply SweetBrownReimer says 10/15/2017 at 834 pm Thanks for sharing. I really enjoy your Insta feed. Stay strong and enjoy our ?! ??

The world needs more people like you ❤️ Reply Michelle says 10/16/2017 at 226 am You are very brave and I hope that speaking about it means you feel less alone if indeed you do/did and of course that we your readers stand with you in support. I have not had the same experience as you but travel has healed me in other ways significant to me. In times of doubting myself my ability my drive my very sense of self it is solo travel that consistently brings me back to my core – who i really am what I can achieve what I like/dislike the every day choices i make away from the constant ‘noise’ of other well meaning people. It gives me the best sense of my own ability competence and self of any therapy around!! Thank you again! ❤ Reply Lori says 10/16/2017 at 626 am Thanks for sharing Kristin! I was date raped by someone I trusted and looked to.like an older brother. It put me on a path of abusive relationships and no self worth. I finally forgave the guy but I still struggle in many areas. This happened when I was 22 I’ll be 49 this week. It’s a struggle at times but we women have to stop being away of judgment and backlash. I had people question me say it was my fault etc but no woman deserves to be treated poorly. We need to teach our sisters daughters etc that we are strong and we can overcome! Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1156 am That’s amazing to me that you were able to forgive. I struggle with that but I will get there one day. I can’t believe anyone questioned you but tbh the police basically did the same with me and made me feel like I was partially at fault or had been stupid or something. Can you imagine? A kid! Our society needs to change on this matter. I’m sorry you were abused too but glad you are healing. Reply Sarah says 10/16/2017 at 1015 am Thank you for sharing your story. I hurt for all of us who have gone through this and I am proud of us for surviving. One thing i would add is the importance of having a support system as you travel. Travel can be healing and in my experience I have been helped many many many more times than I’ve been hurt but there’s no denying there can be triggering moments on the road. Just the other day I had to go through a very intense and invasive security check – being forced to remove clothing is massively triggering for a survivor of sexual assault – and I’m so grateful for a dear friend I could reach out to right after that who knew what i needed to hear you’re safe.” Whether it’s friends or a counselor or a support group I think it’s important to know how to access these vital resources as you travel. Reply Kristin says 10/16/2017 at 1157 am That’s really good advice Thank you sarah! Reply terra @ terragoes.com says 10/17/2017 at 833 am Thank you so much for sharing! This was spot-on and well-said. Reply Xenia says 06/05/2018 at 737 am Thanks for sharing this. You should be proud of yourself and what you have done with your life against all odds. A round of applause and go on you are a true inspiration for all of us that are trying hard not to be destroyed by the system. Reply Kristin says 06/06/2018 at 713 am Thank you Xenia. We can do it together <3 Reply Michelle says 07/13/2018 at 101 pm Hand Wow – thank you for sharing that. Funny how so many of us who have suffered choose to seek solace in travel and solo travel at that. I have been bullied – attempted suicide – raped and sexually assaulted – sofa couch surfed having no fixed abode and come out of all it. At the grand old age of 43 I have a mortgage in London!!!! a cat and a fantastic circle of friend setraline aside I’ve a one way ticket to Bangkok from Heathrow and a backpack. My first solo jaunt was to Rome and now I’m doing a whole continent. I’ve been to India and love Yoga so I certainly am a hippy at heart and off to indulge it. Some women despite what life throws as them can’t be tamed and I guess I’m one of them! Reply Kristin says 07/13/2018 at 1125 pm Hell yeah Michelle! Way to rise from the ashes like a phoenix! Reply Michelle says 07/13/2018 at 104 pm PS my cat will be fine – I have house sitters for the duration of my trip.

Tomorrow we board the cruise on Spectrum of the Seas. Theresa has been affected the last couple of days by the amount of sand in the air. To try to stop this progressing into something worse she went looking for something to help it this morning. She could not locate a chemist but found the supermarket and got some throat lozenges. That should help. Whilst she was there she also stocked up on some extra supplies that we shall need whilst we are on the cruise. We have a booking at the Salt and Pepper restaurant in the local Al Bandar Rotana & Arjaan by Rotana Hotel for Friday brunch. Not been here before so have no idea what to expect. This is another buy one get one free from The Entertainer. We had a lazy morning in the hotel then walked about a mile to the hotel. We had left plenty of time as we were not 100% sure where it was but found it really easily. We like to get into these brunches early to get pictures before the food is touched but we were 20190503_115012 an hour early so had a coffee in their coffee shop to occupy ourselves. The food on offer at this brunch was split down by countries. So you had sweet and savouries from each countries all grouped together. A very unique way of displaying the food as normally all sweet items are together. We tried to sample from many different areas and all food we had was really excellent. We do not normally take a lot of notice of the food left at these brunches but the couple at the table next to us caught our attention. They were constantly bringing back plates heaped with different foods and most of it was being taken away uneaten by the servers. The amount of food that they wasted was more than the two of us actually ate. This disgusts us. The walk back to our hotel was nice as it gave us a chance to walk off some of the food. We shall be leaving the hotel and joining the Spectrum of the Seas for it´s voyage to Singapore tomorrow so this afternoon we had to pack up all our belongings. We had one entertainer voucher 20190503_143437 left for an ice cream at Baskin Robbins so had a wander over to the mall for one last visit. A great way to finish a great day and a great visit to Dubai. Thanks Dubai. Our third visit.

It was somewhat unexpected and hard to believe that it is April. The wind even chilled the sheets on the bed making them cool to the touch. We shivered all night under our bedclothes. Even in the morning with the heating on in Suzy we shivered. We were woken up to the sound of birdsong coming from the trees in the wood next door. The church bells rang out. All our neighbours were abed as we drove away from our little idyll to head for our next port of call St Croix en Plein. Close to Colmar we had been in this area before. The journey was relatively painless and uneventful. Being a Sunday the lorries were parked up for the day which meant that the roads were fairly empty. I feel that I am lacking in inspiration as I write. My cold sore on my lip has erupted with a vengeance and wonder just what I have done to deserve it. Been a bad girl I guess!!!! They say that a picture tells a thousand words and sadly I have few pictures to show so Swiss Alps - not quite a photo from St Croix but the best I could do far. The rape fields gave way to empty ploughed fields waiting for the next crop to be planted. The yellow Laburnum flanked the roadsides. The grass had in parts been harvested already. A few months earlier than home in the United Kingdom. Cows munched away in the fields. Vines were being cultivated and the framework was erected for the upcoming hop harvest. For the first time we passed through a peage where virtually every van was being stopped and searched. It seemed that security was relatively high. We saw our first Crazy Legged Crane – a stork – with long gangling legs hunting for food in the fields. The more ingenious one had legged it to the Aire at Haute Konigsbery and was finding food around the rubbish bins. So where did Suzy end up? In a campsite in the isolated area around the village of St Croix. An area of nothing but farms I didn’t expect much from the campsite. Reception was closed when we arrived so with half an hour to waste we walked around to see the lie of the land. The site is huge and very peaceful. Chickens wandered around pecking at the ground. There was a swimming pool but yet not open. Bungalows were scattered around the site. The plots were large and well set out on grass. The sanitary block was clean and tidy. If there was a problem it was the electricity supply. Plenty of posts but they were quite a long way from the plots. Once reception opened we paid our 17 euros 90 site fee ordered bread for the next day and set up on plot 36. With awning pulled out we sat admiring the pink phlox growing thickly on the bank beside us. We drank our wine amongst the mauve Bearded Iris . We even picked up English TV. Kathrein of course decided she did not want to go back down into the parked position. We played a round or two of our quiz. We started the Big Quiz two rounds a day when we set out. We had got through a round of History and one of Geography. Glenn had crept ahead. Today we covered sport and cooking . I edged in front. So what of today? We have passed the signs for the battles of the First World War the Maginot Lines and one of the largest and best preserved examples of a Vauban fort . Tomorrow we had over the border into Switzerland.

Soon it is time for my long journey home. One thing I have learnt is that my ipad speaks a totally different type of English to me so for this last blog I am not going to correct any of the changes it makes or the suggestions it gives me! Here goes... On the plane to Thailand I had a few little worries mainly what if I got lost what if I cannot find where I am staying? Being alone made that feeling bigger as I knew I would have noone to ask but I surprised myself... Not once was I lost perhaps misplaced a few times but that was it! That was my biggest worry sorted. What if I got bored with myself? That didnt happen either - I had anticipated feeling a bit alone or lonely - that didnt happen either! So overall a good trip and it certainly has boosted my confidence a bit. HIGHLIGHTS Elephants! Without a doubt being able to bathe with one wash her feed her and being shown around her patch of jungle was an amazing experience. I was smiling like a nut-job all day and still smiling when Careful! Poipet warning And some people do not understand a notice such as this? On the Thai - Cambodian border. Going in to Thailand at Poipet. I recall how it felt. The floating village without a doubt. I have wanted to see this for so long after seeing it on a TV Documentary - it was well worth the effort to get there and see it first hand. It is far more impressive than watching it on a screen - to see the children playing and waving at the odd white woman - amazing isnt quite the right word! The bridge over the River Kwai... this was not a bit how I imagined it. I have read of the destruction many times seen it portrayed on TV in films and documentaries but to actually see it stand on it and take time to wonder... It was much smaller than I had imagined but that in a way makes it more horrific thinking about what happened there. I recall being told a very long time ago that my Granddad Taylor was in the war office in London and was there when final decisions were taken - Im not sure now just what that means but I am going to try to find out Helen... do you know??. Seeing the ruins of Ankgor Wat was Our amazing world Having seen these pictured on TV and on websites I wondered if they were as big as they seemed or as impressive as I thought they may be they are huge and enormously impressive and to stand there and touch it is amazing. It makes me wonder about other things other places... Truly amazing. pretty amazing too the recent history Pol Pot the millions who were killed by palm tree leaves seems too incredible for words! Travelling alone has given me time to relax and enjoy time just enjoy being... I hadnt anticipated how that would feel - just being... again amazing! So in 2 hours I will be on the first leg of my journey home. Taxi to the ferry then the ferry bus to Bangkok Airport plane to Muscat plane to Heathrow underground train to St Pancras train to Sheffield then Lees Taxi to my house 😊 Perfect!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 8 Displayed 8 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Pollys Wotsits and adventures pollywotsit Embarking on my African Adventure travelling solo to Zimbabwe Botswana and South Africa in April and May 2014 ... full info Joined March 3rd 2006 Trips 1 Last Login March 17th 2020 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 31 Guestbook 78 Photos 156 Forum Posts 0 blog=751737 blogger=13376 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=751737 blogger=13376 Advertisement The bridge over the river Kwai Although the bridge is small compared to how I imagined it to stand there and wonder what it mAy hAe been like for the prisoners of war to build that and to remove all the stones hillsides etc ideal it is unimaginable - there is no way I could imagine how they managed or felt. dinner on the River Kwai More a beer really had a bit of food. scenery was stunning Tone Sap One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the floAting village at Tonle Sap.

I was just lounging around and not doing much and forgot to post. So lets start this post with what happened 2 days ago. We lounged around in the morning I read my book my mom did yoga and not much happened. Around 600 pm my mom and I went down to the beach and swam. Then around 900 pm my mom Teja and I got in Shawns car and drove to Sant Pere de Ribes a small and beautiful town 10 minutes from Sitges. This is the same town I had the fiesta de espuma in. We drove to the house of Mercé and Peter and their kids Zoe Leo and Kay. My mom Teja Mercé and Peter went out for tapas traditional spanish meals. Zoe Leo Kay and I went down to an ice cream parlor or heladeria as they call them here and got ice creams. I got a lemon and nata mixture. Nata is that ice cream without a distinct flavor. We all played monkey in the middle with the frizbee down in the plaza where the festival of foam was. All of this was in Spanish and it was a great opportunity to practice my Spanish. That day was a blast. Yesterday was fun too. Around noon Kirana one of Shawns friends and Noah her kid came over. Noah and I played with the frisbee My mom Kirana Noah and I played a game called clue. And then Kirana Noah and I played a big game of monopoly. I had lunch at 500 dinner at 930 and went to bed at 1100. I guess thats just normal for Spain. One thing I noticed hanging out with Noah my spanish is improving a lot. I now dont even have to think about what I am saying in Monopoly. When I want to say something it just seems to fall out of my mouth in Spanish. Its a really neat experience. Tomorrows post will have images I guarantee. My mom is just packing up to go ... somewhere. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Skye Cushman Hawthorne Skyedude I am 11 years old and I am from California.

Share Tweet Pin LinkedIn 0shares The perfect way to get outdoors in Sweden is by renting a cabin in Sweden to enjoy the beautiful Swedish nature that the country is well known for slow down and enjoy some omtanke. This post may contain compensated affiliate links. For more info please see our full disclosure here! Why Stay in a Cabin in Sweden? Sweden is well known for its great outdoors and beautiful nature. And although forestry is important to Sweden as an industry it is one of the only countries in the world to buck the trend of de-forestation and actually plant more trees every year than it cuts down. Forests cover 57% of Sweden making getting out into the woods and enjoying them an essential part of any visit to Sweden and how better than by staying in a cabin or house in the middle of nature for some forest bathing or chilling out. We teamed up with our friends at Nature.house known as Natuurhuisje in their home country of the Netherlands to find out their tips for staying in a cabin and how choosing to stay in a sustainable house in the middle of nature can help the environment too! There are many cabins along Sweden’s beautiful lakes Image c. Nature.house Nature.house Adventure holidays in nature that help us save the planet Have you always longed for a trip in nature away from the crowds and mass tourism? Dutch company Nature.house – nature.house offers beautiful homes in the natural world where you can live out your dream holiday completely away from the craziness of the big city. For all the nature lovers here’s the best news Nature.house plants a tree for every night you booked on their platform and every newsletter subscription as well. A substantial part of all the accommodation on their website is sustainable which also contributes to a greener life. The company has managed to compensate the CO2 emissions of more than half of all stays in 2018 making a small but significant step in the fight against climate change and more sustainable travel. Camping under starry skies in Sweden Image c. Nature.house Nature Houses & Cabins in Sweden Nature.house has some beautiful accommodations in Sweden. You can find typical wooden cottages in the Southern Central and Northern regions of the country. There are also a few very unique homes – treehouses above the ground and even a glass house on the water. To get closer with the locals rent a farm or a country house. The themes in nature offer you the possibility to choose your perfect natural surrounding for your holiday whether it’s homes by the water or near the sea a secluded house deep in the woods or in the mountain regions. You can stay in a bungalow with a veranda in front where you can have your Swedish Fika” break a hot coffee and cinnamon bun! while surveying the countryside around you. You can even stay in Sweden’s cabins in the snow! Image c. Nature.house Why is this concept so important for our life on Earth? Much of the wildlife on Earth is endangered the biodiversity is severely threatened and the at risk numbers are constantly increasing. If you look at research on the topic of sustainability you’ll discover that planting trees is one of the most effective and efficient ways to stop climate change and is a key part of any solution to protecting the planet. Nature.house are now working hard to reach their goal of planting 1 million trees by 2021. The countries where trees are planted are chosen carefully looking at where the new trees have the greatest impact on the ecosystem and climate change. These are all African countries namely Tanzania Burkina Faso and the 4th biggest island on Earth – Madagascar. These places where the flora and fauna is threatened will benefit the most because planting trees will ensure the biodiversity is kept alive and even enriched. This is also where the new trees will have the greatest impact on CO2 reduction. Another positive outcome is that the initiative supports the local economy by creating jobs for the local population.

Due to all the hype of the Royal Wedding coverage a decision was taken to have a Royal Wedding Party. The plan was that due to the time difference the build up started at 6 with the ceremony at 8 so this laid the ground perfectly for a fancy soiree involving sushi and champagne. My task for the afternoon was to get some tat so we could celebrate in style. I think I did well in locating a fancy dress shope where I located 2 plastic tiaras some party poppers crisps sweets etc. The plan was also to get all dressed up in a fancy frock but in the end Im afraid i just couldnt b bothered changing so I enjoyed the wedding wearing my plastic tiara hoody and combats it is apparently what all wedding guests will be wearing in the session of 2011/12/ Before this Linc had also got christines engagement ring resized and all I can say is that OMG talk about the Rock of Gilbraltor! Saturday was my last full day in the Land Down Under so I had agreed to attend an early morning Gymn class with CP... boxercise was our class of choice in a Virgin Gym about 15 mins away. Up until few years ago I was a regular at Body Combat Classes which I did enjoy but had never done boxerise before. Unlike the gentle opening few minutes of classes back home this class started at high intensity for the get go. It was gonna b a long 50 mins. The instructor was Maori and wud have fitted in well in an All BLacks team. It was intense but good fun though i wasnt looking forward to using my arms next day to lug my cases about the place! As it was my last night CP had booked table in Manly Wine Bar blagging a table at window saying she had an important visitor over from Ireland- yep i felt V special. Perefect ending to my trip over!. Sunday - I reluctantly packed up my belongs and said a sorry Cheerio to a Lovely Sunny Sydney typical now i was going home!. This time i was flying through the night so was determined to try and get some sort of sleep if I could especially as i had work the next day. I have had such a fab time in sydney and the whole break was exactly what I had needed and been looking for after a shitty few months. It has refocused me to realizing that life is for living. I guess in last few years i have been stuck on the WORK- HOME _ TV hamster wheel but this trip has helped me open my eyes to Living Life fully. Yes maybe the weather at home isnt so good but there are loads stunning places all over Irelnd that I havent visited cheap flights to countries in Europe I need to discover...

This is a large impressive river with a variety of bird life. We spotted pelicans cranes and ducks all looking for their breakfast. Next to the river is a monument to the racehorse Gunsynd better known as the Goondiwindi Grey! It won a Melbourne Cup in its long and illustrious career. It was very peaceful and quiet by the banks of the river and we enjoyed our early morning stroll. Then it was off on another long day of driving. We set out on the Newell Highway our destination for this day Dubbo. This is a sparsely used road which does not pass through any really large settlements so for the most part it was easy driving.The first main settlement was Moree which we drove through and continued on to Narrabri. The landscape changed from scrubby trees to more cultivated land with a scattering of cattle and sheep.. In Narrabri we decided to go into the town for a look and try to find a bakery for lunch Bird on the river bank however as this was a Saturday morning the place was bustling. It was hard to find a park but we did and then went for a walk past the shops. We went into one cafe packed tight with locals having a late breakfast and realised that we would have to wait far too long to be served. Across the street we found another smaller cafe but this too was jam packed so we gave up found a public toilet and drove on. We reached Connabarabran about 1-30pm. We saw a bakery sign but this was closed. We eventually stopped at the local pub and went in to seek some sustenance. There were a few punters in the main bar and we asked if they were still serving and we were pleased when the affirmative was given as the answer. We ordered and then went into the Beer Garden to await our meal with a glass of Coopers Pale Ale to maintain us.In the courtyard was a very large grape vine with a notice saying it had been planted in the 1890s and was stilI bearing fruit. Impressive! I had ordered the soup of the day sweet potato and leek Macquarie River and this was a large bowl of delicious orange flavoursome liquid with just the right texture and creamy goodness. Fletcher had a grilled barramundi which he said was one of the best fish he had had on the trip and he has had plenty that was something! In the end an excellent choice. From there it was another 150 kms to Dubbo and we changed drivers and kept going. We had one hairy moment as I was driving. A car came from the opposite direction bearing an Oversize Load Following sign. I started to slow down and move to the left but the other car suddentdy went over the centre line towards us forcing me to brake suddenly .and giving us a real scare. He went on blithely leaving us a bit shaken and cross. We came into Dubbo and found our motel the Homestead easily . Once checked in we were pleased to see it had Foxtel as the Showdown was on and we wanted to watch. As it was only about 3pm we went into the main street of Dubbo and had a walk. This is a large regional town with all the facilities which you would On the banks of the Macquarie expect. We found a Coles and bought breakfast supplies and a bottle shop for some wine then we returned to our room. We soon found that only 4 channels were available on the Foxtel and none of them were the Fox Footy Channel. The manager tried to fix this but to no avail. By this time the game had started so we drove to the Dubbo RSL Club where we found their Sports Bar showing the game on one of its many channels. We settled in and were very happy with the first half but the Crows fell into a hole after half time and we lost interest with 10 minutes to go. We went to their bistro for dinner where I had a very nice chicken linguine while Fletcher dined on pizza. Back at the room we started to watch the Australia v South Africa One Day game but by 11pm I was asleep. Fletcher lasted a little longer but we were glad in the morning that we had not persevered as we lost that too! We left about 9am as we had only about 5 hours of actual driving to do before reaching Canberra where we could With Gunsynd rest for a few days with Melissa and the boys. We headed off on the Mitchell Highway to Orange. When planning this trip we had thought of going to the Hunter Valley but instead decided to check out Orange and the wineries near there. Again Orange is a main town of the region and we drove in looking for a loo and found the Visitor Information Centre. Here after the loo stop we asked the very helpful woman at the counter about the wineries. She marked the road to take and suggested we go to Phillip Shaw wines first. Across the road from the Information centre was a large square with a bandstand and a memorial to a local figure who had not only been Australias first VC winner in 1901 but had become the Mayor of Orange. His name was Major General Sir Neville Howse and he also became the local MP and Minister for Defence and then Health in the 1920s. The three faced marble monument was a tribute to him and each face represented an aspect of his life including his pioneering work in the medical field. Following the advice and directions given to us we In Narrabri soon found the modern winery Phillip Shaw. This is cool climate country and wine has only been in production here since the 1980s. The cellar door was in an attractive stone building and we were greeted by a young girl who took us through some of the wines. As we still had a way to drive we were temperate in our tasting but enjoyed the Pinot Gris and Merlot/Cab Franc we tried. The two shiraz we tasted were a bit thin for me. After buying some to take with us she suggested our next stop should be at Ross Hill. This proved to be an excellent choice. Here we were greeted by a young man with large earrings who was very pleasant and certainly knew his wines. We sat at a table while he took us through their range and we selected a few to taste. The conversation was wide ranging and the best wine was the straight Cab Franc which was reasonably expensive but delicious. Another purchase made we decided that had to be our limit and we drove the rest of Pinnacle Road past Lake Canobolus back onto the road to Canberra. This took us through Canowindra Old Grape Vine where we stopped at a shop bearing a sign saying Coffee and Meals. This was a quirky place a Trading Post containing a range of knick knacks jewellery pottery and at the back a place where we could order a meal. Again I had the soup of the day a Potato Leek and Bacon which proved every bit as good as the one from yesterday. Fletcher opted for a Ham Cheese and Tomato Toasted sandwich . We both had some good coffee and sat outside in a large garden area filled with bits and pieces all for sale. I drove on from there through Cowra Boorowa to Yass where we joined the Hume Highway and then onto the Barton Highway for the last leg into Canberra. I had driven for over two hours so we stopped at Murrumbatemen to change over and we were soon on Northbourne Avenue and thence to Angas Street and Melissa . We were greeted by Jude and Melissa. they had just got back from Zacharys birthday party held at a nearby Rock Climbing venue. Soon the rest arrived and we spent the afternoon chatting with champagne and then a delicious roast pork dinner with Park in Orange much red wine and conversation. I found the quiz on the internet and this provoked much merriment and discussion as it usually does. We only got 38/50 and challenged Sam and Tracey via Facebook to beat us. They didnt! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 13 Displayed 13 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message Colleen McEwen MrsMac I love travelling and have done as much as I can over the 68 years of my life.

Since I last wrote I havent really done much that deserved a good read so I thought I would bank up some days. Monday 13th and Tuesday 14th were spent on Jomtein Beach in South Pattaya. The beach was beautiful. The Thai people line it with overlapping umbrellas which pretty much went down to the sea it wasnt a very wide beach but very long. This meant that most of the time when I was sunbathing in my deck chair I was actually sitting with my feet in the sea sounds weird but the waves are so small as the water is so calm shallow and clear so it was pure nice. It was also pretty cool under the umbrellas too like a labyrinth where the Thai locals would be cooking up food socialising and playing games. They would offer out the food it was all pretty much deep fat fried prawns and barbequed squid Gross and cheap too but such a relaxing atmosphere. On Tuesday evening I went for a mooch down the street on Jomtien 5 Road. This is where I found the night market and the music plying Jomtein Beach I become obsessed with Sunset photos. This is the best one I took monster truck. While I was at the market I ordered Thai Pad and a German Sausage. I bit into the sausage and thought Thats pretty wrank and needless to say I ate no more. Thai Pad was nice though nom! Wednesday 15th I woke up feeling really ill obviously something I had eaten over the last few days didnt agree with me. I woke up at 6am and luckily I was the only one in the 8 bed dorm of which I was so happy about.... Number 2 stage fright would have definitely gone out the window if anyone was in there but luckily I didnt need to worry as I didnt have time lol..... I went back to bed until 1pm. I woke up and thought I would go to the beach. Got to the beach but could only last 1 hour I felt rough as a badgers! Needless to say I went back to the hostel and thats where I stayed for the rest of the day and night. That night Carolyn who is from Utah joined me in the dorm. She was cool and we got on really well. We also had another girl who came Pattaya Bay This is where I caught the ferry to Koh Larn in at 12am. She annoyed me a lot. Im sure she came dressed in a bin liner. She was rustling plastic backs for about an hour bearing in mind it was like 1.15 am I was not happy to say the least. We named her The Bag Lady.... Thursday 16th I woke up and was on top form thank god! I went for a fry up down the road and then walked 3 miles I originally thought it was 5... I wanted to find an electrical shop so I could buy a beard trimmer but never did find one in the end. I was also walking towards or at least in the pre-tense that I would find the pier so I could get the ferry over to a tropical island Koh Larn. Pretty much stumbled across it and also walking street Where Ladyboys on Sky is filmed. Got the ferry over to the Island. This place was heaven only 1000 people live on it. The seas are turquoise and the sands are pure white. They did the same here as they did in Jomtien re the umbrellas. This time though the beach was totally flat and quite wide so Nice This small Island was off the coast of Kho Larn. It had one house on it! Someone is obviously lucky to live there they had sun beds rather than deck chairs and this was so cool to sunbathe on a bed while the sea was slowly flowing back and forth underneath me. The boat right back was epic. The waves were massive and made the boat was pitching so much and I got soaked but it was such a cool experience I loved it!! I walked all the way back to Jomtien so it turned out to be a long and exhausting day. Friday 17th was another beach day. I went out for a meal at night but it was gash! Jomtein was so nice but it was massively geared up to cater mainly for Russians and damn they were rude!! Saturday was another beach day. Saturday night Carolyn and I went to Walking Street in Pattaya City. This totally opened my eyes to Pattaya and how it got its reputation. It was full of Lady Boys bar with curtains over the front doors bars with bars and more bars inside one building and loads of screaming Thai boys and Ladies dying for attention and money as well as being the loudest street on earth and rammed with thousands of people. Koh Larn This is the beach I was at where the sea flows under the sunbeds We went to a bar which had 12 other bars inside. The long Islands were only £2.45 each so I made the most of that and consumed about 8. Needless to say I didnt drink much more after this. Carolyn wanted to chat to people so we starting chatting to three guys from Sweden and ended up spending the rest of the time with them. They took us to a different and better bar that overlooked the bay. Shots were flowing the music was banging! I decided that I couldnt handle anymore drink so I left Carolyn with the guys and she ended up going back to their hotel room for the night... Dirt Bag lol. I think everyone has seen the video I made while I was heading back to the hostel..... I actually made 3 videos but can only show one lol. Sunday I left Pattaya and headed back to Bangkok. This consisted of one pick up truck ride to the bus station. One 2 hour bus ride to Bangkok. A 25 minute sky train to the eastern line. A 15 minute overland tube train to Sukhumvit and a 20 minute taxi ride to the hotel..... Loads of travelling!! Finally made it! Checked in and literally got into bed. All this travelling was done in 30 degree heat an 18kg bag on my back a small back pack on my front and one of the worst hangovers for a long time lol. Sunday night there was a bomb attacked in Bangkok not far from where I am due to the current protests so I decided that once my stay is up here Tuesday Morning that I would check out of Bangkok and get way from this drama. Today Monday 20th I went for a walk up and down Sukhumvit road. Prior to this I was sunbathing on the roof terrace got too hot though due to no fresh air! While out walking I did see down the road a blockade where some of the protesters were camping so I quickly turned round and walked back. Stopped in the shop and got 5 poofty pops Mojitos in a bottle for like £2. BARGIN! Thats is so far for now. Got to venture across to central Bangkok tomorrow to the Embassy to get a re-entry permit so I can go to Loas and Cambodia and then come back into Thailand in early Feb in order to go to Phuket and all the islands and to meet Emma P and Katie 😊 and then Im getting the over night train to Chiang Mai tomorrow evening which should be fun.

Following breakfast we boarded the bus but for some reason there were no wake up calls so several people were late. It was rainy and cold. Our agenda today was to get to the Dome of the Rock. This is the huge gold dome that you see in just about any picture of Jerusalem. The dome is under Muslim control and they can and do close it often so it is tricky getting to go there. This is my fourth trip to Israel and I have only been there one time until today. Today we were successful!! The Dome of the Rock is considered a most holy site by Jews Christians and Muslims alike. It is the third most holy site to Muslims following Mecca and Medina. It is built on Mt. Moriah the site where Abraham was to sacrifice Issac. The are many rules and regulations you must follow to visit here. You cannot have any religious objects so if you wear a cross necklace you must remove it or hide it. You must dress modestly and show no public displays of affection. You cannot offer prayers or devotions. I know of some one who had their Bible taken E99DA649-F9E3-417D-87EA-3CCAD28F880D. because it was in their purse! You even have to go through a checkpoint much like going to a government building or the airport. The place beautiful and you have a great view of the city and old Jerusalem. From there we walked down past the church over the place where Mary was born and to the pools of Bethesda.This is where Jesus healed the lame man who had been sitting by the pool for 38 years waiting for someone to lower him into the healing waters. Read the story in John 52-12. In that same area is the Church of St. Anne which has perfect acoustics. If you sing you can hear the music reverb perfectly. We sang It is Well With My Soul and Amazing Grace and it was beautiful. We moved on through the old town and the Via Dolorosa. The roads are very narrow so when a car comes by everyone has to move. It is also very crowded as we pass through the Temple streets. It is very difficult to stay together. This is where people could and do get lost. There are locals going to work. There are locals that are 00695A0C-AE6F-49BE-9D1B-DEDD83328CC6. shopping. And there are groups of tourists....many groups. Refer to the pictures to see just how congested is really was today. This is also an area of high pick pocketing. Its crowded so you know you are going to be bumped around. There are stores and vendors so you are getting in and out of your purse frequently. You have to be careful. There are 14 stations of the cross on the Via Dolorosa which goes back to that all important number 14 and the generations of Christ. The Via Dolorosa is located in the old city of Jerusalem and is the path where Jesus was lead in agony carrying the cross.. It starts at the place where Jesus was tried and convicted and it ends near the crucifixion site in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Inside the church you can see the marble slab where they prepared the body the rock on which the cross stood and the empty tomb. Today the lines were extremely long and it seemed people were pushing shoving jumping line. As we were standing there complaining about the situation Debbie Weekley said We really should happy that so many people want to F0403761-D21B-46AB-8A6E-86D1FBB14F34. some here and pay tribute to and honor Christ”! Kinda put things into perspective. Once we all gathered together after exploring the church we met walked to the bus and left for lunch. Our guide was going to take us someplace special. It was the City View Restaurant on the hill above Jerusalem. and they do have a wonderful view of the city!! Our lunch was a choice of falfalel pita or chicken Swarma sandwich. The young ones got pizza and they said it was all good! Today was the first time we had encountered unisex bathrooms. There were two bathrooms and you just went in the one that was empty. Everyone whether male or female waited in the same line used the same two bathrooms or WC - water closet and washed hands together. Many of our group thought it was odd but this is becoming more and more common. The afternoon found us back at the temple visiting the Teaching Steps and the Western or Wailing Wall. The Teaching Steps are so named because rabbis like to teach their students there just outside the temple. So did Jesus. Some of the steps have been reconstructed 67419E0A-31A0-4773-803C-87C5688BEE37. but there are original steps there...steps on which Jesus has walked. Imagine sitting there at the feet or our Lord and Savior and hearing him teach the Bible or hear one of his parables! The steps are uneven in width so that people has to be careful bow their head to look at their feet and enter the temple humbly and unhurried. The last stop of the day was the Western Wall also known as the wailing wall. It is the most sacred spot for Jewish people. It was the support wall for the Temple Mount and since the Temple Mount is not always available the Jews pray and wail here as often as is possible. The men and the women are separated and the men must cover their heads. It is traditional for people to place their written prayers in a crack in the wall. Twice annually - before Passover and before the Jewish New Year - the notes are removed and buried on the Mount of Olives according to Jewish tradition. I placed all my prayers in an envelope together with those given to me. It is a very touching experience to go there and pray. 6CB96926-0247-465B-80E7-ACE559509B08. Tomorrow after a full day of touring we move to a hotel on the Sea of Galilee. So that means we have to pack up and get our luggage out in the hallway early in the morning before breakfast. Its hard to believe this trip is winding down. We have two more touring days and one more overnight before we start the long ride home.

We had picked the campsite near the river due to its location within walking distance of the city and the public transport which stopped outside the camp. We also wanted to use it as a base for two days in which we could go to Strasburg. The journey into Colmar was lovely with the hillsides covered in vines. Every village was pristine. A lovely church storks nests on top of the Mairie or the church. Flowers everywhere in gardens and in public flower beds. There was certainly a sense of pride about this region and everyone played their part keeping it cleanneat and tidy. When we arrived at our camping site the young receptionist was just leaving for lunch. We had arrived at 12.25. She wasnt due to leave for 5 minutes but she was locking the door and going for her lunch. Not returning for an hour and a half we were instructed to go onto the site into the holding area and wait until she came back from lunch when she would book us in. Whilst we waited we had a look Colmar around the site. It seemed quiet and well organised. There was no problem with space with plenty of spaces for motorhomes close to the river. The plots which were close to the river though were small and sloped. There would be little room to put the awning out or bring out the chairs. After our quick look around we went into the campsite restaurant. There were no tables available outside as these were all taken. The waitress found us one inside. As it was hot we did not complain - it was rather nice to sit in the shade for a while and while away an hour or two. I ordered Tarte Flambe Forestiere and Glenn a normal Margarita pizza. It took a long while for the food to come as the waitress was on her own serving drinks and taking orders for food. My Tarte Flambe was a local delicacy a thin pizza crust covered in a white sauce with thinly sliced onions and mushrooms on top. Lovely if you love onions and I do. The tart was made completely of thinly sliced onions and was very tasty. I had heard of Tarte Flambe watching the Hairy Bikers Colmar on tv and had earmarked having one when we reached Alsace. It was far too much for lunchtime and I had to regretfully leave some of it. Glenns pizza was as usual nice to start but got rather boring as he worked his way through it. For both dishes we were charged 19 euros and 60 cents which did seem a touch pricey for a campsite restaurant. We would have liked to have gone again but felt it too costly for what was on offer. It felt a bit of a rip off. It would have to be home cooking for us tonight and tomorrow . When 2pm arrived so did the receptionist. She picked a plot number for us which was close to the water and just below a rather grotty mucky old washhouse. The sinks were full of leaves and muck. I have no idea when it was last cleaned. Storks wandered around the tents caravans and motorhomes swans swam on the river. I was a bit surprised how a municipal camping ground could be so dirty in places . Normally they are excellent value and exceptionally clean. Having said that the new toilet blocks which were Colmar quite a walk away from our plot were much nicer and cleaner. Later as the afternoon wore on more campers arrived and tents were erected between us and the river. A convoy of wagons appeared late afternoon. It looked like the local guide or scout troop had arrived. We heard the boom boom of music in the distance and lights appeared in the woods as kids played games well into the night. It did not auger well for a peaceful night. We walked into Colmar in the evening 2 km each way. It felt much further than that as we saw the bus sail by.Had we realised it was on its way we would have waited for it rather than walk. The houses on the way were uninspiring. Walks seem so much better when you have something half decent to look at. We didnt feel inspired by the walk at all and the Centre Ville seemed hard to find as we took our lives in our hands trying to cross busy intersections. Once we did find our way in the centre was heaving restaurants and cafes filled to brimming packed the streets. Some of which looked awfully expensive. We Colmar just wanted a drink and it took a long time to find an Irish bar where we could buy a lager and a coke. The squares in the town were pretty as usual with fountains and flowers everywhere. Music rang out from cafes and musicians played their instruments on street corners. We walked to Little Venice lined by beautiful fishermens cottages. They all looked very pretty lining the narrow streets which were made even narrower by the restaurants which spilled into the lanes or into the water. I was reminded of BrugesGhent or Antwerp rather than Venice. We had intended staying in Colmar to see it lit up. We had read that on Friday and Saturday evenings the main buildings were lit up. I thought seeing the church the town hall and the other medieval buildings woudl look magical however it did not seem to want to get dark and we had a long walk back to the campsite to look forward to. The walk had indeed put us off going into Strasburg the next day. We did not fancy another 2 km walk to the station a long train journey before spending the day walking around Strasburg. Strasburg would have to wait for another day and the lit up city missed as well. Still some things you win and others you lose. . When we arrived home it was dark the campsite relatively quiet however by 12 the party began. Music drummed across the site until 2 in the morning. We never did find out if it was the guide/scout camp or a disco in town. Later we heard bottles being thrown and broken. We battened the hatches hoped Suzy would be Ok and waited for morning. We had paid for two days camping but felt we did not want to stay another day at this site. When we left we felt a touch of disappointment but our next destination a municipal site near to Riquewihr sounded as if it was going to be peaceful and would give us the opportunity to wind down and try a little of the famous Alsace wine. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 22 Message Jennifer Jones JenGog A 60 something who feels that the world is her lobster that life is worth living and that you only get one shot at it .

Today we moved to another area – Inuyama Yuen. I have a problem with planning our route. For the second time in our trip in two days I mis-read our itinerary and we got off at the wrong station to get to our hostel. In the end it worked out for the best since we visited all the places we wanted to go and more as we trudged from one place to another. But God we really clocked the miles today and I was getting very frustrated with myself. P was very patient – I don’t know how she managed it. We walked over 5 hours as we crised-crossed the neighbourhoods of Inuyama with P heaving all her belongings on her back and me relying on my Antler wheels and creating a din along the way. I wanted to say Sumimasen totem wurusayi desu” Sorry I am very noisy but I did not think they would appreciate my sense of humour. I have to say that today was our most productive day ever. We visited Inuyama castle had tea at breakfast in a local eatery in Inuyama2 one Japan’s most prestigious tea ceremony locations – Jo-An tea house and visited three shrines including those meant for male and female fertility which was very fascinating. I had a very good day today. First we dropped by a small local eatery to have our breakfast. They seemed kind of surprised to see us foreigners. After three days in Japan we are starting to realize that either the Nagoya areas are not commonly frequented by foreigners especially when I think it is near impossible to communicate since little or no English is spoken here or this is not the season for traveling. We were served a traditional breakfast consisting of toast thick and soft coffee/tea hard-boiled egg and a small teaspoon spread of red bean sauce. It was delightful. Inuyama Castle In Inuyama castle I was shocked to discover that castles are made entirely of wood?? And the steps to ascend and descend the castle are more ladders than stairs. There was an instant I thought descending the stairs backwards would be safer – a testimony of how steep the stairs were although I have to admit that I am bad with heights. There was a tour group of breakfast in a local eatery in Inuyama4 interstate elderly Japanese who soon joined us in the castle. They huffed and puffed and mounted the stairs with much gusto. There were even elderly people with walking sticks who were completely unfazed. I was thinking that this would never happen in a Western country – there were so many fall risks that the operator would have been sued into bankruptcy. Plus before we entered the castle we were required to remove our shoes and we were given a plastic bag each to carry our shoes with us. We were thus striding and climbing around in rather ill-fitting slippers. When P descended one of the staircases one of her slippers actually slipped off and slid all the way down. Apart from being amusing and perhaps a tad embarrassing at the same time I thought that was just an accident waiting to happen. Evidently the culture here is much about personal responsibility. Also there were four fairly large lockers that we could rent to deposit our bags for 200 yen each. It was large enough to accommodate a large backpack or a large traveling duffel bag so that was a relief. Inuyama Museum We also visited the Inuyama museum where breakfast in a local eatery in Inuyama Yiwei we saw two towering structures one filled with lanterns. Apparently according to P they are either moved or new ones are built during the Inuyama festival. For what reason we are unsure. I bought a pack of postcard depicting sketches I hope to mount them and frame them up. I was actually after a map of Japanese castles but they ran out of stock. Was also contemplating buying a T-shirt but finally decided maybe it was too much of a gimmick. Jo-An Teahouse We then hauled our heavy bags and went to the Jo-An teahouse one of the most prestigious in Japan. It costs about 1300yen each for both of us – 1000yen for entry fee and 500yen for the green tea. We get a discount since we could share the tea between both of us. The operators were kind enough to allow us to deposit our heavy bags in the ticketing area so we could enjoy our tea in peace. Also I think it was a precaution on their part – heavy bags and exhausted girls can cause unintentional damage. It was a very tranquil area and I think the main point of it was to relax and Inuyama Neighbourhood5 go into deep contemplation. Unfortunately for both of us we were on a tight schedule and intense reflection was not possible. I think the only part I really enjoyed was the actual teahouse where we were served some sort of sweet red bean dessert and a bowl of really nice green tea – not too dilute or too concentrated. Plus we were left alone in a heated room facing glass windows that ran half the size of the walls which gave us a view of the surrounding gardens. I did lapsed into serious contemplation although I think P didn’t and it is probably because I am more serious and I space out a lot more and a lot more easily. Inuyama International Youth Hostel Next was the final trek towards the Inuyama International Youth Hostel. By this time we have walked more than four hours and still going strong. I reckon these are the parts of my Japan trip that I will remember – the agonizingly long walks we take because of stupid mistakes the constant whinging and bickering and the maddening number of stops each of us took as we went trigger happy with our cameras. Did I Inuyama Neighbourhood16 mention how glad I was to have bought both a compact camera and a D-SLR? This is what the Lonely Planet Guide does not tell you about the Inuyama International Youth Hostel. The Hostel is indeed 25 minutes away from Inuyama Yuen train station but it is up a hill along a one-way mountain road which allows TWO-way traffic including large trucks. About half the time the pedestrian path is restricted to a small space just off the white line which is especially dangerous around curves as vehicles tend to ride over the white line to allow space for oncoming traffic to pass. Also it was deserted as hell and we were surrounded by forest on one side and river on the other. The clincher came when we finally arrived at the entrance of the road leading to the hostel. There was a shit load of stairs – maybe four or five sets of twenty really steep stairs which is woeful to the traveler with a heavy backpack or in my case a duffel. P and I are not unfit – P does regular kickboxing I do daily soccer and BJJ training sessions – but by the time we Inuyama river heaved our shit up those flights of stairs P was traumatized and I was ready to murder the next person I met. Also the stairs were covered with fallen maple leaves it was beautiful but also very telling of the number of people who used those flights of stairs – none. I reckon most people either drive up to the hostel or catch a cab. There were no street lamps so going back to the hostel is dangerous after nightfall. The hostel operator said that so far there were no reports of any incidents but he added that there are no residences in the area so even if there was an incident no one will be around. I should also add that the hostel is located on a parcel of land that is flanked by a cemetery on each side. I did not find the cemetery spooky it was rather peaceful and elegant but this may put some people off. The operators were really polite and friendly and were more than happy to loan us torches on request by P. P thought the torches would come in handy if we return home after dark I felt that if we a shrine near inuyama castle2 needed to use torches to illuminate our paths we are better off spending some money in cabfare. In the end we did take a cab about 1300yen from Inuyama station. We were glad we did because along the way we saw how dark the place was we could tumble off the path or easily taken a wrong time if we were not careful and yet never realize it. Also the cab driver had to use high beam to light his path – another reason we were glad we decided to spend some well-deserved cash. The hostel also stated that guests should be back before 10pm. I was appalled at first more to do with the actually restriction on my freedom – you can tell I am old enough to be unaccustomed to having a curfew but we came back early anyway because the operator would have to stay up late just to let us in and we did not want to be rude. The hostel also provides supper at a price because the surrounding area has no food after 7pm there is a homely little place a stone’s throw away from Inuyama Yuen station that closes at 7pm. We a shrine near inuyama castle3 ate our lunches there and it was pretty decent. The operator is patient and friendly and I finally had the chance to practice my Japanese. I refused to speak in Japanese when I was in Nagoya because everyone seemed to be in a mad rush and I did not want to be in anyone’s way or waste anymore of their seemingly precious time. However P and I decided against supper we rather visit Inuyama station which is really alive at night to get our dinner and supper. We dropped by a departmental store near the station where I bought two grade 1 Japanese books to read I was very pleased since I could never browse actual Japanese books online bought a clear file folder I finally know what kind of souvenirs I should collect from each country on my travel – the front page of newspapers! and the supermarket which was simply breathtaking. There was so much yummy Japanese food that we ended up over-spending and over-eating. We got sushi potato cakes instant noodles that we never say outside of Japan three variants of Asahi beer miso soup ice-cream bread for breakfast and the list goes on. It was a shrine near inuyama castle13 heavenly. The other two temples that we visited and ones that I was really looking forward to because I was highly curious were the Tagata Jinja and the Oagata Jinka temples for male and female fertility respectively. Both were on the Meitetsu-Komaki line. The male temple was a 15 minute walk from the station and the female one a good half an hour walk. Tagata Jinja The Tagata Jinja had two holy areas filled with wooden statues of penises of all sizes lengths. This is when one thing struck me – the statues were all of circumcised penises – I never knew that Japanese had the practice of circumcision too. Either that or it was just easier to construct a statue of a circumcised penis? It was quite humourous until we came to the board where temple-goers hung wooden boards of their prayers and I realized that infertility is more common and less laughable than I thought. There were pleas to be able to start a family save a marriage or to provide a sibling for an existing child. Apparently there is also a festival where a large statue of a penis would be brought out into the a shrine near inuyama castle14 town. On hindsight I am thinking infertility is not really a correct term is it? Erectile dysfunction should be apt considering there are no statues of any testicles to be seen! Anyway I bought a small golden penis decorative item to keep as momento of this fascinating temple that I have been to. Oagata Jinka The female temple was less intense and more respectful. We went there half an hour before closing time. And no there were no statues of holes or vaginas but there were symbols that were hanging around that are supposed to represent the vagina. The symbols were quite respectful and tastefully done. There was a couple and a priest there when we arrived. They looked serious and prayed carefully at one of the sacred areas. Makes me solemn when I wonder if the young couple has been trying hard unsuccessfully for a few years to have a child. Unlike the male temple this temple did not sell any momentos of vaginas. So instead I got myself an amulet for fertility. It is more of a remembrance and a counterpart for the golden penis that I have bought earlier on. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 85 Displayed 30 « Back 1 2 3 4 5 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message The Spud Paradox TheSpudParadox I am intending to make my graduation trip at the end of 2010 the beginning of my travel endeavors.

A Brief Introduction to Train Travel in Thailand Trains are one of the most comfortable and enjoyable ways to get around Thailand. Forget freezing in air conditioned sleeper buses that seem to think they’re transporting items that need to be frozen and instead sit back or lie back and watch the serene Thai country side roll past or read your book as an attendant comes and nicely folds down your bed for the night. Travel by train in Thailand is low hassle high comfort especially on the brand new trains and one of the best ways to take in the contrasting scenery. Plus it’s the only way to be certain of skipping the traffic. There’s a certain air of nostalgia too about Thailand’s railways Impossibly quaint signal boxes and station managers’ offices rising above freshly swept platforms dotted with flower pots are the order of the day completed by a picture of the Thai royal family at every station.

Classes of Travel Planning & Booking for Chiang Mai Bangkok Trains. Which Chiang Mai Bangkok Train Should I Take? Where to book Train Tickets in Thailand. Why Travel from Chiang Mai to Bangkok by Train? Frequently Asked Questions for Taking the Chiang Mai Train Taking the Train Chiang Mai to Bangkok The trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok are comfortable usually efficient and one of the best routes to enjoy Thai train travel on. I knew that when I returned in November last year that it wouldn’t be long until I’d find myself back on the rails. When it comes to Train Travel in Asia there are few countries where it’s easier or more comfortable to travel by train the train journey over the river Kwai is unforgettable and the best way to travel between Chiang Mai to Bangkok is by train. We’re not biased we promise… Yet unfortunately many travellers seem to be unaware of the options or have been tarred by experiences of being ripped off by unscrupulous travel agents. Help is at hand though and here I’m sharing my experiences and tips for taking the Chiang Mai Bangkok sleeper train – without being ripped off! Even better train tickets can now be bought online saving the hassle thanks to the ever helpful asian booking site – 12go.asia – get your tickets here. Looking to travel from Bangkok to Chiang Mai by Night Train? The information about the trains and experience in this post about the Chiang Mai Bangkok train also apply heading towards to Chiang Mai the super rapid express leaves Bangkok Hualamphong Station at 08.30am daily. Book your tickets now on 12go.asia here! Fresh faced on arrival in Bangkok! Journey Logistics Chiang Mai to Bangkok by Train. I love falling asleep on sleeper trains. I find that there’s something soothing about the motion of the train on the rails. This journey from Chiang Mai to Bangkok is perfect for just that. The Chiang Mai to Bangkok train journey takes around 12 hours if you take the express / super rapid option. There’s a choice of two express trains one leaving at 5pm and one leaving at 6pm from Chiang Mai. There are also a couple of slower trains available that leave earlier in the day but these tend to arrive in Bangkok in the middle of the night and are older trains. The express trains arrive in Bangkok at 05.25 and 06.25am respectively although both times that I’ve taken the train from Chaing Mai to Bangkok it was about an hour late. Either way the length of the journey is perfect for getting a good amount of shut-eye! Time to relax and catch up on journalling! A few hours into the journey train staff come around and pull down the upper bunks convert the lower bunks and make-up the beds with clean linen. Both times I’ve taken this train I’ve opted for second class sleeper so I can’t attest to first class luxury but 2nd class has always been a wonderful experience for me. Arriving into Bangkok in the early morning this time I was greeted with a ruby-red sunrise creeping through the gaps in-between skyscrapers and flyovers as we crawled into Bangkok. Walking out into the early morning sunshine from Bangkok’s Hualamphong station provides a rare chance to see the city in a cleaner early morning light after street life has already begun but before other travellers are up! I’d also enjoy doing the reverse journey taking the sleeper train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai where the early morning view is of the mountains and countryside houses surrounding Chiang Mai as opposed to the concrete jungle of Bangkok. Love train travel? Find some of our favourite scenic train journeys in this post. Inside a new 2nd Class AC sleeper carriage on the 6pm Chiang Mai – Bangkok route. Classes of Travel Planning & Booking for Chiang Mai Bangkok Trains. I recently read an account by another blogger who’d been scammed into buying two first class tickets at a huge markup so that she could have the first class sleeper compartment to herself and avoid sharing with an unknown male”. A few points that will help avoid this sort of scam First class compartments – if you’re a solo traveller you may be paired up to share the compartment but only with someone of the same sex—solo travellers of different genders will not be paired up by Thai Railways. Most foreigners opt for second class air conditioned where there are no compartments but sleepers are open plan have privacy curtains and are very comfortable. Train tickets open for booking a maximum of 60 days ahead. Some companies may offer to book further out for you but they can only actually make the reservation when ticket sales are opened by Thai Railways 60 days in advance of travel. Powered by 12Go Asia system Which Chiang Mai Bangkok Train Should I Take? There are several Chiang Mai to Bangkok day trains you can choose or three Chiang Mai to Bangkok Night trains. There are also different classes of trains in Thailand from Rapid far from it to Special Express. Train number 10 that departs at 6pm daily is the most popular and fastest train to Bangkok. Thai Railways timetable courtesy railway.co.th Day Trains The day trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok generally use older rolling stick with cheaper sitting classes available that are fan / not air conditioned. These options are perfect for those with time on their hands want to get the most of seeing the countryside or are after the best value seat. These trains also take longer than the faster night trains taking up to 15 hours to run the journey with more frequent stops. Day Train options include the 06.30 and the 08.50 departure from Chiang Mai. As you can see from the Chiang Mai to Bangkok train timetable below only those wanting the truly scenic experience should take train number 102. Night Trains Sleeper trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok leave daily at 15.30 17.00 and 18.00. Train number 14 at 17.00 is a slightly older version of the 18.00 express while train number 52 at 15.30 is a slower older version again. For those who want the chance to take photographs through an open window the 15.30 departure is a good bet – train number 10 is fully air conditioned and has sealed windows and doors. Where to book Train Tickets in Thailand. If you’re already in Thailand…by far the easiest option is to go and buy them yourself from the train station. Remember to take your passport with you! From outside Thailand if you want to book ahead you’ll need to use an agency. The one we suggest is 12Go as recommended above who will offer you the option to collect your train tickets later in Thailand at a hotel or nearby major stations. The same booking restrictions apply i.e. maximum of 60 days out but they have a minimum of 3 days before travel for tickets to be booked. Personally I’ve always booked my tickets in Thailand at the Station a week or two in advance. I’ve never had a problem this way even on the busy Chiang Mai to Bangkok route. Thai holidays and Chinese new year can get busy though so it’s best not to leave buying tickets last minute or leave it until the day of travel. At December 2016 the price for a 2nd class AC sleeper on the new express trains from Chiang Mai to Bangkok was 881 Baht for a lower birth or 792 Baht for an upper birth upper births are slightly narrower and you don’t get a window view 😉 .

In short a few reasons. Not only is train travel more environmentally friendly than flying I find it a lot more comfortable and efficient in terms of time as well. Although the flight between Bangkok and Chiang Mai may be a short one add on the time to get to the airport at either end check in go through security etc and it’s not so short after all. With the train I save myself the cost of a hotel for the night and the hassle of security and getting to and from airports. Being transported from city centre to city centre whilst I sleep is a pretty sweet deal. These older trains are not used on the popular sleeper routes anymore so you won’t be on one of these… But there’s another reason. For me train travel is also an opportunity to see more of the local culture. Each time I’ve taken the Chiang Mai – Bangkok train despite there being other foreigners around I’ve chatted with locals and got to be able to enjoy what is going on around me. This doesn’t happen on a plane. The first time I ended up trying to have a conversation with a lady opposite me who spoke no English and I don’t speak Thai! based on the language glossary in the Lonely Planet! The next time on the train to Trang a lady attending a business meeting in Bangkok invited me to stay with her. After arrival in Bangkok – views over the Chao Phraya River. This time from Chiang Mai it felt like the whole train was full of social media fans or bloggers perhaps! who were focussed on making videos of the brand new train which runs on the Chiang Mai-Bangkok 6pm route. Lastly travelling by train in Thailand is incredibly safe. I’ve taken most of the sleeper trains in Thailand by myself and have never felt unsafe on any of them. Heading to Thailand? Grab your Lonely Planet here! Frequently Asked Questions for Taking the Chiang Mai Train Which is the best Train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok? This depends on your point of view. If you want the fastest most comfortable train then train 10 leaving at 18.00 daily is a good option – but book tickets well ahead of time as this is also the most popular train to Bangkok. For those with more time on their hands we recommend giving one of the day or part day trains a try which offer a more local way of travel and more time to enjoy the views. How can I buy tickets for the Chiang Mai to Bangkok Train? If you’re already in Thailand you can easily book tickets at any Thai Railways train station within 60 days of departure we recommend booking at least a few days ahead. If you’re not in Thailand yet and it’s within 60 days of your journey we recommend booking your tickets online here. Which is the Best Class of Travel? For a comfortable overnight journey we recommend booking Second Class Sleeper Air Conditioned which gets you your own berth upper or lower with privacy curtain that converts into a comfortable window seat during day time. Upper berths are available at a slight discount compared to the slightly wider and more sought after lower berths. When Should I book My Train Ticket from Chiang Mai to Bangkok? As soon as you can within 60 days of travel and preferably at least in advance. If the sleeper trains are booked up there may still be tickets available for one of the day trains.

In both cases they converted to seats to beds around 7 pm much to early in the evening in my opinion. Admittedly the last time I did the trip was in 2006 maybe the policy has changed. Reply peck December 2 2019 - 811 pm hi Ellie thanks for writing about training within Thailand. I’m an asian who always travel to Bangkok but have not gone to other cities in Thailand. So this time I’m planning to go Chiang Mai and Bangkok. can i ask for your opinion as of which direction do you enjoy the most? or which direction do you think has the best view? Chiang Mai to Bangkok or vice versa? Reply Kim February 7 2020 - 909 pm Hi Ellie! Looks like you were traveling with just a backpack – what is the luggage situation on this train? Thank you! Reply Ellie Cleary February 12 2020 - 917 pm Hi Kim there’s space under the seats to store your main backpack or suitcase and you can keep any valuables in your seat/on your berth with you. There’s space for a suitcase but travelling light is always easier. Hope that helps!

Today we got the train from KL Sentral to Butterworth for Penang another new experience. I had booked the tickets online and chosen seats behind each other so we could both be next to a window. The cost was £15.50 each as it was only a tiny bit more for Business Class and this was so worth it! We got to the station early and went in the food court upstairs. I think it’s quite new I remember going downstairs before. Only a few places were open and it was cheap but very average. We had teh tarik and he did the pouring it from a great height thing which makes quite a head on it. My roti telur eggs on toast were cold as she had said they weren’t mine and then realised they were. We had been over to the ticket office to find that our printouts were also our actual tickets so you go to the people sitting next to the platform and they tick you off the list. They then told us to wait in the Business Lounge upstairs how fancy! but there were no free snacks there. Sadness! Then we all went down in the 269C7CF7-5538-4DF8-ABA0-FEC71404CEE7. Business Lounge KL Sentral lift and got on the train first carriage A. Luckily all the seats were facing forwards. Plenty of room for luggage a footrest tv screen and table in the armrests. When we set off we were brought a selection of cake things and a juice then at 11am a rather nice lunch totally unexpected so it is well worth paying the extra and not having to go to the buffet car. The journey was super comfy and passed really quickly. Lovely views of the countryside and mountains. 22 stops but we didn’t really notice them and I was excited to stop in Ipoh where about 14 years ago I’d stayed in the very grand but falling down Station Hotel a relic of colonial elegance. Now it is all abandoned with the windows left open. We were probably among the last guests as the rooms were on the brink of being uninhabitable then! We got to Butterworth at 12.30 so it took 4 1/2 hours. I loved every minute! Then we followed the signs to the ferry. I’d read there was a shuttle bus but it is such a short distance you don’t need it and we didn’t see 1FB470CC-776F-42A8-ABB6-8F84EB5E27B7. KL Sentral waiting for the train it anyway! There are lifts. As you come out you are hassled by taxi drivers wanting to take you over the bridge. We said no and followed the ferry people. I thought it was free but you have to buy a ticket for 1.40 ringgits. More or less free! Then we waited about 20 minutes and again were the only westerners taking it. Disappointingly the ferry didn’t come in where I was expecting next to the E&O Hotel. Maybe I just didn’t remember right! So we didn’t fancy a 22 minute walk to the Bay View Hotel and got an overpriced taxi for 15 ringgits instead. So we have come all the way overland from Singapore using 2 buses and a train. Go us! All of it was easy and comfortable. I thoroughly recommend it rather than flying.

One week until the Kimberley trip!!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Oceania » Australia » Australian Capital Territory June 23rd 2019 Published June 23rd 2019Edit Blog Post MickP It is high time for another trip this time up to the Kimberley. We have a new vehicle for this trip and we are looking forward to putting it through its paces on the Gibb River Road. We’ll be away for 7 – 8 weeks and covering around 15000 km give or take. The rough itinerary for this trip looks a little something like this • Head up to North toward Mt Isa and onto Katherine in the first seven days approx. 3600 km • Hang around Katherine for a few days and onto Kununurra for another few days and then sloooooow right down • Three weeks between Kununurra and Broome and then stay in Broome for a couple of days • Across through Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek to the Bungle Bungles in the Purnululu National Park • Follow the Tanami Track down to Alice Springs • Head East to the Hay River Track and then follow that South into the Simpson Desert and onto Birdsville • If we have time head South toward the somewhat full-of-water Lake Eyre and then an unknown route home. Our little dog Bella gets a guernsey for this trip as we won’t be going into too many National Parks and for the ones that we do want to go into we have company in Di and Tony who are going to bring their pooch Jack and they have kindly said they’ll look after Bella for us when we hit Mitchell Falls and some other NPs. This weekend sees our last major chance to get everything ready to go bar food and clothes. Heading off next Saturday nice and early – cannot wait! If anyone has any ideas of places along the way that we simply cannot miss please let us know! Some of the places on the list to date include the Longreach Qantas museum Barkly Homestead Mataranka Springs Lake Argyle El Questro station Wyndham Mitchell Falls Drysdale River Kalumburu Derby Cape Leveque Wolf Creek Crater and maybe Innamincka the Dig Tree Cameron Corner. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message MickP MickP Not much to tell really...... full info blog=1036441 blogger=266408 Blog Map Trips 3 Print Version 25th June 2019 Jo H non-member comment VERY envious At Katherine I hiked up through the gorges and swam back down to camp ground jetty getting windy as the sun was setting. It may have been made easier because water levels were low that year clambered over rocks between gorges. It was a great experience - particularly watching those Johnson crocs slipping into the water I swam with my sneakers on!. The ranger came out in his tinny as I was rounding the last bend and I asked if there were many crocs we tagged 200 just in this one last year. Didnt swim at Fitzroy Crossing HUGE salty sitting on a nest - great dairy farm near the crossing that sells milk shakes!!

Thats the time I was sitting outside my hotel room ready to be picked up at 615am. I let the hotel reception know on the off chance they turned up and I had gone inside. I popped in to go for a squirt heard some tooting outside. Thought that was my ride. Sprinted out faster than Cool Runnings only to find no-one there. Thought they mightve driven off without me. Called the number I had they didnt answer. Thought Id been set up so called again. The lady answered and told me they are on the way. An hour and 4 calls later just when I was about to accept Id lost my money they rock up. Strangely everyone on my tour speaks Spanish - given its not specially Spanish - just worked out that way. We drive around the city and pick more people up. Stop randomly tell people to change to another van then load them back into ours. This things so fucking disorganised you wonder if this utter muppets know how to tie their shoe laces. We get to the floating markets and I pay 150 baht $7.50 for a half hour boat ride. So the floating market is just that. People with boat in the river selling their goods to people who turn up in boats. Now I just wanna say that this was fucking hectic and an experience in itself. First off it breaks all sorts of safety laws. No life jackets. No speed limits. Hundreds of boats thousands of people in a small confined space. Not even kidding. There were traffic jams on the water. Boats crashing into everyone. Motor boats charging through. Like the possibility of falling out of the boat and having someone run you over was incredibly high. A boat comes past with a beer so I get amongst that. 50 bhat at 9am for a beer why not! We go around to the many stalls. I want to prove to myself that I can haggle so decide to get a gift for someone. The merchant wants 850 bhat $42 I drive a hard haggling game and we end up settling on 300 bhat $15. Being a stubborn fuck makes haggling so much easier. The people in front of me are impressed and when they go to buy something they phone a friend and ask the pro haggler behind them what they should pay. The merchant wants 2000 $100 I help them settle on 800 bhat $40. Every day Im Hustlin! We finish up that tour and go to the market next door. I try my hand at haggling again and end up walking away from a deal I probably shouldve taken You win some you lose some then take a speed boat up the river. This is more terrifying then fun. Like I mentioned earlier there are a lot of boats on this river. The only difference is now instead of being pushed along by an old Thai lady were diving at SPEED towards them! We change into another van then next stop is the Train Market. On the way there we see things that are typical of Thailand - shit road safety. - Green means go. Orange means go. Red means go. - People walking in the middle of the road hawking goods while youre at the lights - Utes / open back tucks overloaded with people - Vehicles blocking others from moving forward at intersections cutting each other off. Its quite fascinating and certainly makes you appreciate how NZ roads operate. The Train Market is a market with train tracks running through it. You browse then next thing you know a big fucking train turns up and all the vendors rush frantically top pull back their goods and roof covers the proceed to shout at the tourists who are trying to take selfies on the impending train charging towards them. Like me.. less the selfie. We start heading back to town. I notice there are a lot of man made field canals and lakes for fresh water seafood. What I found really great was they utilised all the land. Around all these man made canals and lakes they have planted banana trees so their investment generates additional income. Its so fascinating. We get back to town I go for a swim at my pool hotel and head off to get food. Found this place called Broccoli Revolution that honestly may have been the best vegan food Ive ever eaten. It was SO delicious. Spicy Cauliflower Gaeng Kiew Wan Vegan Eggnog - $23. This was a REALLY expensive meal compared to my usual spending but hey Id pay circa $50 for that in NZ and it was fucking amazing. Went and got beat up by and old Thai lady for an hour after that. It was a such a good massage - especially because it only cost me $13. I wanted to go to another place for a 2hr massage which was known as The fancy place but ran outta time as I had to be at my tour logistics meeting at 6. Met up with my Intrepid group. Theres 10 of us 4x Mad Cuntz 2x Swiss 1x Murican 1x German 1x Belgian 1x ridiculously good looking and the greatest gift to the world Kiwi. I happen to know the last one well heres a clue its me. Our tour guy Vanny is Cambodian from Siem Raep which is really cool as it means weve got someone who properly knows Cambodia taking us around. We went out for a quiet meal then myself and one of the Mad Cuntz couple went up to the Sky Bar. Its ridiculous. Level 65 and you can see everything. They have strict dress code regulations- which dont really make sense. You have to wear closed shoes and dress Smart - yet we rocked up in jeans and t-shirts and they were turning away people who were wearing expensive Dresses all because they were wedding jandals or shorts etc because their toes/knees were exposed. They tried to turn away one gourmet looking guy with several beautiful woman around him he objected then another lady realised he was Mr Antonio - apologised profusely and let them in. The place was designed for rich people like the cheapest drink was $40. It was mental. We went up took our photos and left before buying anything haha. Anyway 11hr drive crossing into Cambodia tomorrow.

One of her students Mew has become quite the facebook stalker on our teacher facebook account and finally asked us to go on a trip with her. She wanted to take us to Amphawa a well known floating market about 40 minutes from Mahachai. We requested that she take us via train so that we could see the scenery outside of Mahachai factory city. Just meeting up with her at the train station was a huge communication hassle and finally after an hour we found Mew and her two friends. So even though Mew is really into hanging out with Teacher Erika she can not or will not speak a single word of English. Its pretty awkward. Erika says she does great in class but when Mew and her friends were with us in person there was no conversation to be had. Just a bunch of nodding and gesturing. They were very cute though they grabbed our hands to protect us while we crossed the busy streets. It was a funny sight to see Erika towering over Mew but Mew taking charge and Erika and I  taking care of her. Its like we have never experienced walking on the streets before and they were very worried for us. I guess it would be a bad thing if the foreign teacher was hit by a car or something while spending an afternoon with their students. The train ride was really neat. I felt like we stepped back into time. It was a very old looking cabin and there was no air conditioning. The seats were comfortable though and the scenery was green and lush.. So different from our dirty factory city. We passed by many salt plantations and random small Thai towns. The train track was literally peoples backyard and I could have touched their houses if I dared to stick my arm out of the window. As we neared our destination the scenery began to transform into a local market. The market vendors had to lower their tents so that the train could pass through and we watched as they repositioned their tents back up once we were through. It was a fun sight to see. Every available space really is used here in Thailand. We took videos/pictures of the Thai market and Mew taking care of Erika the Thai tourists in the market took pictures of us in the train as we passed through. As we arrived we then took a local bus to the actual floating market area. We missed the actual floating market by a couple hours but were still able to take a boat tour to 5 different temples along the river front. While on this tour I spotted a local taking his morning shower in the river! The temple tour was interesting. The girls hung out with us and never really said a word but we still felt honored to be able to spend time with our students outside of the classroom. With over 1000 of them you never really get to know any one of them at all. One temple had a petting zoo where you could feed the various animals. The cows were really funny to watch eat with their massive tongues reaching out of their cage to get their grass. I made a massive mistake of getting too close to the monkey cage to get a cute picture. Within a millisecond I felt my camera fly from my hands and watched it crash to the ground. The The floating market monkey quickly noticed my bling camera wristlet and made a go for it. The camera was luckily too wide for the fence and didnt make it through.. As for my bling wristlet.. That was quickly in the monkeys mouth. I felt completely awful! I didnt want to have the poor monkey eat my wristlet and get hurt from it. The zoo keepers were able to get the wristlet and handed it back to me. I believe they did this more for me than the safety of the monkey because there was piles of trash in the cage and it was a really sad sight to see. I do hate how the animals are used for tourism like this though. There is no need for that monkey to be chained up in a trash filled cage just for my enjoyment. 😞 At any rate the trip to Amphawa was an interesting experience. This is not the last we see of Mew and it only gets more awkward from here. She is sweet but we really do wish that she would make more of an effort to speak with us rather than just sit and stare… « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 7 Displayed 7 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Carolyn Fowle GypsyJourneys Im happy with who I am who I am becoming and who I aspire to be.

At the gate of Khirbet Qeiyafa On Tuesday May 22nd we took off for a 3-day excursion through the Shephelah Coastal Plain S of Tel Aviv and the deserts of the Negev. Our first stop took us far and away from our home base of Jerusalem westward bumping over valleys and over bridges on the modern roads which now scream past the ancient trade routes and fortresses. We eventually turned off at a small industrial complex and the large tour bus freight liner? began slowly winding on a small gravel road past wheat fields and vineyards. If our tour guide had been any but the fearless and atrociously knowledgable Brian of Fresno Pacific Uni we probably would have been slightly more suspicious ending up where we did! Our drivers efforts were soon rewarded however as we disembarked at the base of Khirbet Qeiyafa a Judean outpost dated from the 10th c. BC. I was very happy to see a pristine example of a 4-chambered gate typical of the Middle Bronze era as this type of construction was very common for the time period. Further I had not realized that the sewage and used water from the functioning settlement would have traveled down a path of Columnbarium at Mareshah stones which simply emptied to one side of gate spilling onto the hillside beneath! Also an inscription found at this site may provide evidence for the united Monarchy mentioned in the Old Testament. A somewhat surprised shepherd happened over the hill during our visit as well. Our next visit was to Bet-Shemesh house of the sun which like Khirbet Qeiyafa has strong connections to the Philistine conflicts with the Israeliets mentioned in 1 Samuel. I was fascinated to learn that though the animosity between the groups was high interchange between the Philistine and Israelite camps still existed. This is evidenced by a small amount of pig bones at Bet-Shemesh an Israelite site while a large number of pig bones were found at Philistine sites in the vicinity such as Timnah. Of course under the Torah consuming pig was expressly forbidden. Next on the agenda for this very packed day was the site of Tel Azekah. We spoke briefly about 1 Sam 17 which as most students in child Bible studies learn is a portion of the Bible describing the battle between David and Goliath. We discussed the legendary height of Goliath who may have only been about 6 Olive Press at Mareshah feet tall! Hardly legendary by todays standards but at the time likely still would have towered over his fellow countrymen and the Israelites. I was very intrigued by Brians suggestion that David may have been tall and solidly built as well as King Saul since when Saul offers David the armour David rejects it - not because it doesnt fit but as the text alludes to because he was untrained in its use and felt clumsy. David may also have been older than the very boyish stereotype which we have given to him. We spent some time at Mareshah Bet Guvrin where we explored a series of underground caverns including many with blocks hewn out of the walls for raising pigeons! These pigeons would have been used for cultic practices. We also had the privilege to see an olive press from the period of the Ptolemies and I was surprised to learn that 1 million olive trees would have been needed in the area to provide enough supply for these presses to supply the demand. Our final site was Lachish which I will save for another time since this has gotten really long and my chai latte was Sidonian Patriarchial Tomb Mareshah drained some time ago. Enough to say we ended up late at the modern city of Arad at a giant hostel and maybe the best dinner Ive had in a very very long time. Amazing how exhaustion makes food taste better. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 9 Displayed 9 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Steve Griffin Fort Fun Granola Boy Israel 2012 PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS!

So after leaving Bangkok we went to Pattaya which is the HOLE!!! of Thailand the place is horrible it is the capital of the Thai sex industry which I think says it all and there were lots of wrinkley old men with 20 year old girls and there are prostitutes everywhere. It is just completely acceptable there which we found really strange. Also it has been completely taken over by Russians so there was not a lot of Thai culture at all and it was so expensive. One thing that was good about Pattaya was our hostel it was so nice ad clean and we had a huuuge room. We were booked into this place for one night and then we had two nights booked in another. We went to the second hotel the next day and it was awful it looked like a prison and when we went into our room it had ants all over the side. After 20 mins we just thought no way are we staying here so asked for a refund so we could go back to the nice place. At first they argued and would only give us half the money but then DSCF0401 Michael bargained with the man and we got almost all of it back. We had been warned about how horrible Pattaya was but that was where we had to go to spend the day in the elephant village. The elephants were amazing!!! we got to ride them into the grassland where they fed for a few hours and then we washed them and spent time with them. My elephant was called Jandi and Michaels was called Simoon. I would happily do it again anyday - We didnt really do much in Pattaya because we thought it was best to save our money for the islands. But we did meet a really nice girl called Andrea who gave us loads of tips and advice. We travelled to Pattaya with her and back to Bangkok. We have also decided to change our route sligtly and instead of going to Phuket we are going to go to an island called Koh Tao straight after the full moon party. The island looks so pretty and it is famous for scuba diving so we are thinking about taking a begginers course if we have enough money. Yesterday we came back to Bangkok DSCF0402 and stayed at the D&D inn on Khao San Road . Last night we both got a massage and then sat in the roof top pool which is open til midnight!!

Fuji Für heute habe ich etwas spezielles vor denn ich gehe erneut nach Nagoya diesmal aber nicht um Lea zu treffen sondern einen Japaner namens Yuki Kakegawa. Wir haben ausgemacht dass wir uns heute treffen und ich ihm ein wenig Englisch beibringe er mir dafür im Gegenzug ein wenig Japanisch. Auf dem Weg nach Nagoya habe ich mich ein wenig damit beschäftigt die Karteikärtchen zu repetieren welche ich mir bis anhin geschrieben habe und ein wenig gezeichnet. Nach wie vor habe ich Mühe mit einzelnen Hiragana und dem kompletten Set an Katakana. Die Kanji sind eine Geschichte für sich. Yuki und ich haben ausgemacht dass wir uns bei der goldenen Uhr treffen einem bekannten Treffpunkt beim Bahnhof von Nagoya. Ich stand dann bei vermeintlicher Uhr und habe ihm geschrieben dass ich da sei. Er schrieb mir zurück dass er mich nicht sehen könne. Wie sich herausstellte war ich nicht bei der goldenen Uhr Kindokei sondern bei der silbernen Gindokei obwohl diese gar nicht so silbern wirkte auf den ersten Blick. Ich eilte also an den richtigen Ort und er kam mir auch schon entgegen. Wir machten uns auf den Weg durch die Stadt auf der Suche nach einem nicht Billard mit Yuki zu überfüllten kleinen Restaurant à la Starbucks. Bereits auf dem Weg ist mir aufgefallen das Yuki-san sehr gut Englisch kann. Als ich ihm dies sage kommt eine typische Antwort wie Nein niemals ich kann das noch nicht so gut. Japaner gehen generell mit Lob so um ich finde das etwas merkwürdig allerdings zeigt es auch etwas dass er noch mehr lernen möchte. Oder um es in der stark gekürzten Version von Sokrates zu sagen Ich weiss dass ich nichts weiss. Nach einigen Wörtern und verschiedenen Versuchen uns gegenseitig mehr beizubringen galt es uns dann aber noch etwas zu belohnen mit einer Runde Billard. Es war witzig zu sehen wie gewisse Japaner Billard spielen da kniet mal einer komplett auf dem Tisch dort liegt einer über dem Tisch. Ich erkläre Yuki-san die offiziellen Regeln und wir spielen mehrere Runden wobei ich bemerke dass er mit jeder Runde besser wird und dann auch wirklich mit Leichtigkeit gewinnt und das erst noch mit der falschen Hand zum Schluss. Wenn ich ihm schon nicht so viel Englisch beibringen konnte so hat zumindest das Billardspielen wahre Früchte getragen. Wir kehren zurück zum Bahnhof und machen aus uns erneut zu sehen er möchte mich Yuki & Ich seinen Freunden vorstellen. Dann verabschieden wir uns und ich mache mich auf den weiten Heimweg zurück mit dem Shinkansen. Da ich aber nicht wieder mehrere Stunden stehen will führt mein Weg mich zuerst zu einem JR-Schalter wo ich mir einen Platz reserviere für den nächsten Hikari-Shinkansen der 8 Minuten später fährt weshalb ich dann doch etwas sprinten muss. Zusammengefasst ein wirklich toller Tag und ich freue mich auf weitere Erlebnisse hier in Japan. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Fabian Schweizer Chuvisco Joined October 2nd 2014 Trips 0 Last Login October 29th 2014 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 26 Guestbook 1 Photos 170 Forum Posts 0 blog=861146 blogger=300596 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=861146 blogger=300596 Advertisement Travel Blog » Asia » Japan » Aichi » Nagoya » Blogs » Day 16 - Lernen und lehren Tot 0.27s Tpl 0.033s cc 9 qc 49 dbt 0.0274s 1 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 3  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

At the Visitor Information Centre we picked up the brochures for the tourist drives that we had already downloaded from the Internet and printed out but then left in Melbourne! Another useful tip from the staff was that the northern part of Tourist Drive 17 is ‘just a nice country drive’ so we think we might be deleting that from our itinerary. At the university we were impressed with the remarkable amount of material they have managed to fit into a single room ... and a small portion of the corridor outside! Next on the agenda for today was Tourist Drive 19. After a bit of a false start wrong turn ... or two? we made our first stop at the Dangarsleigh War Memorial. This is a privately built monument raised in 1921 by Alfred Haroldston Perrott in memory of his eldest son who was killed in the First World War. Other families in the district were able to add the names of their loved ones to the memorial ... at the cost of sixpence per letter. Dangarsleigh Memorial After the memorial we drove out to Dangars Gorge. Weather permitting Dangars Falls plunges 120 metres into the gorge below. Unfortunately there has been no rain here since March 2017 so the Salisbury Waters that feed the falls have dried up. Putting a positive spin on this it did enable us to observe the way the falls have smoothed out the section of the gorge that they flow over. Ordinarily this aspect of the gorge would be covered with the water coming over the falls. We headed next to Gostwyck where we saw the unusual octagonal woolshed at Deeargee Station and the quaint little All Saints Chapel. Hmmn this whole tourist caper is all about the timing. The brochures show the chapel covered in red Virginia Creeper and surrounded by magnificent elm trees. At the moment the elms and the creeper are bare!! Nevertheless the chapel is still quite quaint. With no eating options in Gostwyck we made our way into Uralla for lunch. After we had eaten we visited the McCrossins Mill Museum. Housed in the old McCrossin’s Flour Mill it was filled with an eclectic collection of memorabilia from the early days of Uralla and Dangar’s Gorge the nearby Rocky River goldfields. A considerable amount of the collection was devoted to the notorious local bush ranger Captain Thunderbolt. Next we went on one of the wild goose chases that Bernie and I are renowned for! Oh look Tourist Drive 21 takes us on a loop south of Uralla so we might as well do that or at least some of that loop before we head back to Armidale. First point of interest Dangar’s Lagoon a protected wetlands reserve for the local bird life. Unfortunately as with all else that involves water in this region at the moment the lagoon was completely dry and looked pretty much like a paddock rather than a lagoon. Hopefully all of the birds have been able to fly away to are more hospitable place. Second point of interest the remains of Irish Town. Hmmn we have no idea where that was as we certainly didn’t see any sign posts along Thunderbolts Way to Walcha. The closest we saw was an Irish Town Bridge but there was no evidence of any settlement old or new near the bridge. We continued into Walcha hoping the Pioneer Cottage and Museum Complex might Dangar’s Gorge be of interest. When we arrived there it was to see a building that looked fairly newly built in a pioneer style so that was also disappointing. Alrighty let’s continue on to Kentucky Road and head north through Kentucky rather than go all the way to Bendemeer which we drove through on Sunday. We did at least manage to find the Walcha Road Hotel and while it is sort of quaint it only dates to the mid-2000s ... and it is closed on a Tuesday! The original hotel was built way back in 1860 but it burnt down in 2004! Oh well I guess we enjoyed a scenic drive back to Uralla but on the whole we felt that Tourist Drive 21 was pretty disappointing. Back in Armidale we made a couple of purchases at Dan’s and at Woolies and then headed back to the apartment to relax for an hour or so before some dinner. We enjoyed the White Bull so much last night that we returned there for dinner tonight. They must be doing something right as it was packed on both Monday and Tuesday night which are not traditionally the most popular evenings for eating Dangar’s Gorge out. The card playing tonight resulted in one game each for the boys and the girls.

Shared my first taxi with 2 American girls who are on holiday from china learning Chinese! After about a 20 min taxi ride and a walk of 2km to a national park quite a pleasant walk past mangroves an elephant sanctuary and a local village. Had to pay 200 baht entry  locals its free or 20 baht and then a further wooded walk to a beautiful waterfall with a plunge pool where people were swimming and cooling off. Headed back to the main road and walked out to the local beach where i sat for a bit and soaked up the sun. Taxi number 2 was shared with 2 guys from Ireland - swopped names with one and are staying in contact via Facebook the taxi only went so far - so onto taxi number 3! This one was hailed down by a very friendly parking attendant at a posh hotel - wasnt really needed but it was a very sweet gesture - and he waved me goodbye! After a really long walk  it said 4km - it felt more like 8!! and hitching a ride on a motorbike sidecar  im sure the driver had been drinking - could smell it on his breath he kept chattering to me in Thai and laughing! the walk was so long i didnt feel like being too picky! I made it to a tiny waterfall - very dried up  it is there dry season pretty surroundings but not much water! There was no chance of getting a taxi out here - it felt like the back of beyond so started the walk back in 30 degree heat and no shade! It wasnt completely arduous tho - saw a very cute group of puppies a little girl came to say hello and blew me a kiss and a pick up truck came past and offered me a lift!! - it was a group who were returning from a trek up in the hills - with 2 guys from the uk! So had a nice chat with them. I got dropped off at white sands beach - very long stretch of beach with lots of shops and restaurants. While walking along i saw monkeys - which really made my day! There was 5 of them on the pavement fishing scraps out the bins - i gave them a wide berth and managed to get some pictures they didnt seem to mind as long as you didnt get too close. Found a nice restaurant and had a lovely dinner last taxi was to take me home. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Sarah Dowdall Sarahs182 blog=872418 blogger=305604 Blog Map Print Version Travel Blog » Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Ko Chang » Blogs » weds day 19 Tot 3.164s Tpl 0.032s cc 9 qc 44 dbt 0.1129s 3 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

Where in the world has Becka Smith been? « Previous Entry Advertisement Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Armidale May 17th 2011 Published May 17th 2011Edit Blog Post Becka Smith P&O Hey Lebtown gang! My apologizes for your loss of sleep since I havent updated for so very long! I know my Grandma was very worried...even though she has no idea what a blog is. Well this past 2 months WOW! was it really that long? have been extremely eventful. Ill try my best to keep it short & sweet! Chelsea Heather and I spent an awesome 3 week holiday away from uni school work and stress to have FUN! We booked a 12 night P&O cruise to Vanuatu Fiji and New Caledonia. This was my first cruise and WONT be my last. The girls and I were 3 of the 6 Americans on the whole ship....we felt quite popular! Check out the pictures posted of the cruise! I do need to mention that this vacation was the first without my family and Joes family too but we still act like kids! Without the hustle and bustle of finding the best road races around the area I really missed my themespecially my bros. The ping pong tables kid pool and ice cream bar really needed some Smith kid craziness. After the cruise the three of us headed to the Gold P&O Coast for Easter weekend. We had massive shopping days...Yes that was plural...DAYS. There was major damage done on this shopaholics part. At the Gold Coast we stayed at Surfers Paradise. It was made of beautiful beaches tons of nightlife an American breakfast cafe still no luck on finding waffles though shopping all of this including it was the cleanliest city I have ever stepped foot in! It was a perfect vacation destination. Easter Sunday was celebrated with a home cooked meal made by Heather. On the menu was Spaghetti with cheese stuffed meatballs peas garlic bread 1 liter of milk for the each of us. I got her hooked on loving skim milk! For dessert we had oreos....classic American teenage goto snack! On ANZC day which is the day after Easter is celebrated almost like Memorial Day back in the States. Kirsty and I planned to spend the rest of the holidays together and I left Surfers Paradise on ANZC day. I am proud to say I made it out of the very scary/sometimes sticky situation of public transportation! I am still shocked that I got there on my own but I did it. Her family and I spent P&O the week in the Sunshine Coast specifically Bribie Island. We did more shopping and hanging out with my best Aussie girl! We loved watching the Royal Wedding- Im OBSESSED! Cass/Hayls- can you please save me all the magazines?! I bought a ton here and thought we could compare! We returned to Drummond & Smith on May 1st. Reuniting with the American girls was so sweet & I missed being away from them for so long! On May 2nd we celebrated together with a toast to the land of the free and thanked God that evil Osama had his life ended. We also were able to watch President Obamas speech online. Since being back we have been crushed with school work but still had time to celebrate Chels & Heaths Bdays! Still waiting on the package Joe.....They would love to have their gifts that were purchased in February! We also killed the other colleges by becoming undefeated in our girls soccer tourney. It was an awesome day. I also do have to thank Miss Cassidy Shaver for her wonderful letters I have been receiving. Staying in that family tree I got a letter from Grammy that totally made my day! P&O The ship! Where you at H-DAWG? I would love a letter from you & Soph baby too! COMING UP NEXT Trip to Sydney!! And Kirstys Bday! Stay tuned😊 Thank you for reading!

Where? Well about 850ks west of Sydney and until Marg started researching the area totally unknown to us. It is like many rural towns with a handful of shops. Unusually there are 4 s servos though. Maybe thats because this is a highway junction in three directions. There has been a battle here to save the Southern Bell Frog which is quite endangered. Not sure how that is going but the area was subject to the best part of a ten year drought so I think that would not have helped. There are 5 rivers also running through the area including part of The Murray Darling and Murrumbidgee Rivers. We didnt see or here any Southern Bell Frogs but Marg did photograph a number of Frog Sculptures around town. These have been used to promote the plight of the frog over several years. We dropped into the Visitors info centre and we were told about a riverside camp on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River. It was located in the Yanga National Park just a few ks out of By the Murrumbidgee Yanga National Park town towards Sydney. The final access was a short section of clay road but in good condition. It wasnt until we finally got to the camp site that we realised how good it was. There were 3 bays vacant on the river edge chose the best backed the MH onto the site and went YEAH!!!! D & M plus A & R were still fishing and wishing at Nyah reserve so we thought we would initiate a little jealousy. A Quick photo on the mobile phone SMS message achieved instant reaction. Where are you? Is there room for us? Sure enough by 9.00 next morning they were queued up for riverside camp sites. We had been planning on reaching Mildura by Sunday but all the camping grounds were booked out due to a boot scooting musical festival. So we had three nights in this beautiful spot. Adrian was bating up and catching fish each day. There are good eating fish here as well as carp which while edible are not the best tasting fish. There were plenty of birds in the area which is typical of riverside areas but they were also very shy and avoided photographers for Scorpion visitor the most part. Marg spotted a couple of the small king fisher birds but they move so quick any photos were impossible. However we had a couple of juvenile scorpions around the camp. When confronted with a camera they played dead except for the raised tail ready to strike. A couple on an adjacent camp site went fishing a little up stream from the camp. They had a more serios interruption to their afternoon when a red bellied black snake got angry with them intruding on his/her space. They moved aside and the snake wriggled down into the river and swam away. They returned to camp for a change of undies and a story for their grand children. Just a short walk up stream from the camp site is the remains of a huge sheep shed and shearers quarters. These were built on the edge of the river so that the paddle steamers could collect the wool and take it to the rail head at Echuca. Monday came and we headed off towards Mildura. The country side here is described as dry land farming. There are huge areas of wheat and in areas with salt bush they run Black cormorant sheep for both meat and wool. So the area contrasts remarkably with the area around Robinvale where we saw the great plantations of vines almonds citrus and other orchards. I forgot to mention one rather unique plantation on the way to Robinvale. The trees seemed too closely planted trees looked twisted and untidy. We were quite stumped as to what the trees were. Fortunately there was a sign - The Australian Cricket Bat Willow Plantation. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 12 Displayed 12 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 15 Message Marg and Rob Humphrey MargAndRob Marg and Rob purchased a Horizon Wattle Mercedes Sprinter motorhome built by Ballina Campers and planned to circumnavigate Australia over the following couple of years collecting it just after Rob retired in May 2011.

We drove through some small villages and some nice vineyards. We stopped at one Chateau but it was closed for the season. We took a few photos and headed on our way. On the north loop we found another Chateau to visit. This one was quite different in that the owner had 80 jet fighters on display outside. Inside he had a collection of Abarth race cars and at least 300 old motorcycles dating back to the very early 1900s. He also had about 2000 airplane models and another 1000 motorcycle and car models on display. There were also several furnished rooms to see. While we were there 3 Ferraris and 3 Maseratis drove up and parked next to the Chateau. They were from England and were on an escorted tour. The most interesting car was a Ferrari F40. Basically its a race car that has been made street legal. It can do over 200mph easily. It had to be 3 feet wider than our car. I dont know how he got it down the narrow The roof of the car and us streets of the village. The next morning we got packed and headed to Colmar. Today is Stacys 67th birthday. Happy Birthday Stacy! Colmar is a quaint village with a lot of old half timbered houses in it. We parked the car in an underground parking lot and headed out to look around. We visited the Dominican church and the Cathedral St. Martin. Then we walked over to the tanners quarter where they used to tan leather hides in the 17th and 18th century. Then over to petite Venice a series of canals that were dug so that all of the towns people could have equal access to water. We had lunch by the old market hall. We stopped at the Unterlinden Museum for a look see. We headed back to our parking garage to get the car. We could not find it. It was a huge garage and in our haste to go out and look around we forgot to see where we had parked it. We thought that we went back in the same entrance that we came out of but the car wasnt where I thought it should be. We walked halfway down each isle looking for The Chateau again it. I thought that for a moment  maybe someone had stolen it. But we finally looked all the way down the rows and there it was. Thank goodness!! The entrance at each end looked identical. We took off and drove toward our next stop which was Strasbourg. We hit some very heavy traffic. It was stop and go on the freeway for about 5 miles. The GPS said it could save us a half hour if we took a different route so we did that. Apparently everybody elses GPS told them the same thing. We spent a good hour in bumper to bumper traffic until we got to our hotel. It is a very nice room though the biggest room we have ever had in Europe. Tomorrow we look around Strasbourg and on Sunday we head for Verdun. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message Robert McGill bobstacytrips TP PROFILE Former TravelPod Member bobstacytrips Joined May 13th 2008From lives in CarmichaelUnited States... full info Joined May 20th 2017 Trips 13 Last Login October 1st 2019 Followers 2 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 173 Guestbook 504 Photos 2694 Forum Posts 2 blog=1004288 blogger=370279 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1004288 blogger=370279 Advertisement Trips England Ireland and Scotland-our first retirement trip!

Friday was a wonderful day. I had stayed up late doing some work Thursday night but was able to sleep in Friday. I had wanted to take a trip to the beach town Al Khor about 40km north of Doha but just didnt want to. Instead I went to the Villagio Mall and shopped til I was about to drop! I bought a reimburseable blackberry for work skirts shirts sweaters... I still need boots and a coat though it is getting cold here. No really! I took myself to a movie Red Dawn. Completely cheesy and predictable but I enjoyed it more than I thought. The movie almost but not quite drowned out the people talking throughout people here have no respect for others in theaters - they talk on their phones or to each other walk around or have their phone lit up texting the whole time. I really dont know why they go to a movie except they must think it is a quiet place to sit and talk with their friends and who cares about those who paid money to watch the movie.. Very irritating and why I only go to early movies or VIP movies here. The road north I met with a coworker from the US last night for dinner going to the Lebanese restaurant that Id gone to previously with Indiana and Tony. We had the usual appetisers fatoush cheese fatayer hummus my carrot juice and some apple flavored shisha - such a great place. I think shisha makes me very very sleepy most of you know what Im like after I drink the cigarette smoke from the table next to us was really irritating though - everyone here smokes. Shisha smells fine and feels clean when you smoke it Ive done it all of 4 times since Ive been here but cigarette smoke gets in your eyes your hair your throat and STAYS. Ugh. Today I was going to drive to City Center Mall nearest my hotel to shop for boots but I was in the mood to just drive... so up to Al Khor I went! It was a pleasant drive though I only got to see camels once and there was more civilization than I thought there would be. The highway was nice and not crowded but plenty of cars so it was not deserted plus there were even expat cyclists! I Happy bridge may have to get back into riding... Al Khor was a surprisingly lovely little beach town. Very clean and well laid out with some very pretty homes and neighborhoods. There was a mall which Im sure is just mostly basics and plenty of places to eat McDonalds of course. They have a lovely corniche that wraps around the little bay there but even though there was a nice little beach and little umbrellas set up on a lovely day there was next to no one there. Such a shame. I decided to drive a little further north to the next town Al Thakhirah which is smaller and even nicer. It is at the end of the road to the gulf and ends in a beautiful mangrove area. This was definitely the highlight of my week. I wish Id brought a blanket and a book. It is hard to describe how peaceful it was. On one side were some guys launching boats including what looked like some kayaks. On the other side is the beautiful clear water and mangroves lining the water. Supposedly there is great bird watching here not my forte and I did hear lots of chirps Welcome to Al Khor all around. Just a very pleasant exprience. I drove back on a different road away from the coast but apparently a main route to Doha as it was full of traffic and there was not much scenery. Maybe the next weekend Im here I will head south towards the dunes... I tried to go to City Center when I got back to the city but the parking lot was full or almost full and there was no way I was going to deal with that! So now Im home and writing this. Maybe Ill take a cab to the mall later tonight I really really want my boots!

So we are all settled in watching a crap DVD about people getting lost in the jungle while making a film about Vietnam war in the middle of nowhere with no one around at least that is what we think when suddenly the Tank starts to rock. I look at Shenton and he looks at me neither of us are moving so what can be going on. There is not a breeze in the air and I for one am a little bit scared. Shenton jumps out of the Tank and without touching the ground is on top of Tank with his head torch on. I hear him moving around then he shouts to me  get my gun out I play along as the most dangerous object I have to hand is his glasses case and say  ok what about your knife he says no not the knife just the revolver I think the kangeroos are shitting themselves now well they better be cause I am. After a few miniutes searching the darkness it seems there is nothing or no one out there and even though Shenton is convinced we are under attack he gets back in Amazing views to watch the rest of the DVD. All goes quiet and we are asleep by around 9.30pm. It is pitch black raining and there are all kinds of noises going on outside neither of us is getting that much sleep when we hear the rubbish bag moving outside. Shenton shines his torch out the Tank window and says Oh my god whatever it is has also got a torch and is shining it back into my eyes. He then realises that he is actually shining his own torch in his eyes he was half asleep. So we get the torches on the rubbish stealer and it is wild dogs or foxes. They have a nibble on the pot noodles but dont seem to like Hot and spicey so they leave. This is aroud 4am and I really am not going to get anymore sleep. By 7am the rain seems to have stopped so we decide to get going and stop nearer the bottom to make breakfast instead of round here as I for one am completely freaked out and it feels like we have been here for a week. We get the rubbish and the table brave the Misty views outside loo this is the scariest part of all and are ready to go. Then Shenton finds one flip flop by the camp which was not there when we arrived it really is time to get out of here as Shenton now tells me that apperently he has read that crazy Vietnam vets live in the outback and wilderness areas of Australia. Shenton turns on the engine then I remind him we have no windscreen wipers so he jumps out to clear the screen and the car dies. He tries again but nothing and again and again. Crap this is getting scary. I am trying to take the drunk Australian mans advice to the old Chinese woman with a bad hip on the plane over from NZ to Australia when he said to her keep it strong wear it like a thong a sexy thong but I can feel the panic rising. I suggest we leave it have a cup of tea and see if it starts in half an hour. Well my mind is racing about what would I take when we have to hike out of here to try and find someone to help us or some Road to salvation signal on the phone that obvioulsy is not 99.9% coverage of Australia as the sales person told me! We get back in the car and I am literally crossing everything and praying that Tank will get us out of here. Shenton pulls out the choke as he thinks he needs to get more diesle into the car turns the key but nothing. Now the battery is starting to go and we really dont have many more shots at this. Then Shenotn has a brain wave we have the CB radio we switch it onto channel 24 and Shenton calls out for any rangers in the area. This time its not a joke and I dont want to play them any songs. We try this for a few minutes but there is nothing. Now Shenton looks to the skys and prays for a miracle and turns the key and hurrah! Tank starts. Our faces are a picture and we both scream lets get out of here. I immediately burst into tears and we dont stop the car until we reach the next major town Taree which is a complete hole but bliss after what we have been through. I am Just like the peak district really glad we took the detour as we got to see loads of kangaroos and breathtaking views as can be seen from the pictures but I am really looking forward to getting back to the coastal route where I can have a hot shower and relax a little. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message Nicola Smith Mrs Smith About to start round the world adventure....... full info Joined February 5th 2010 Trips 0 Last Login August 21st 2017 Followers 2 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 60 Guestbook 61 Photos 757 Forum Posts 0 blog=486478 blogger=151955 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=486478 blogger=151955 Advertisement Brief history of Australia Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century.

It is quite a large city and one of the European Parliament seats and after a bit of a false start to find the tourism office or a tourist map we were thrilled to find the tourist centre is all very close to each other and easy to navigate on foot. Boo and hiss to the hotel concierge who wouldnt give us a free map of the city because we were not guests! And thanks to the helpful girls at the Best Western Hotel who not only gave us the free map but showed us what things to see! We walked along the River Ile watching boats navigate the locks until we reached the medieval part of the city known as Petite France. It was very lovely but we were probably spoilt a little by the perfect medieval town where we were staying. Steven and I commented that we are very lucky to be Australians travelling overseas where all medieval villages are mind blowing – imagine being a travel-hardened French or German who says oh The kids at their boulangerie ho hum – Ive seen better medieval villages elsewhere! The kids found a playground in the middle of Petite France so in the beautiful sunshine in the middle of such a pretty spot they had a game of being pirates or schoolteachers or something. They really are enjoying this trip but like everyone need to take some time out from being tourists to just be kids! The absolute highlight of the day was a trip on the tourist boat – the Batarama – which cruises the river Ile around Strasbourg! It is such a little thing but the difference that an audio guide for children makes to the kids day is amazing! This was one of the best – the tour guide was a pirate who told children about life when he was a cabin boy”. A few bad puns and a bit of humour and the hour on the boat was absolutely wonderful – and still very educational! The sun was so hot for the first time since leaving Australia I even thought about sunscreen Id packed beanies and gloves in my handbag for the day but not sunscreen! Sorry Aunty Amanda! We learned about the beautiful city which has Petite France Strasbourg been French then German then French again for hundreds of years and also saw the modern part of the city where the European Parliament sits for something like 4 days a month. After our boat cruise we had a lovely lunch of tartes flambee our new favourite and the kids even tried one with goats cheese sitting in a sun-drenched square near the cathedral of Strasbourg. We toured the Cathedral which was very nice and quite different - very dark and the rose window is filled with yellow glass whereas it is normally reds and blues. Tom is very pious insisting on a quiet prayer before we tour any church whereas I am not so convinced it is the strength of Matthews faith that makes him want to light a candle in every church that we enter – but Ive told him to say a prayer each time he lights one so who am I to comment on his devotion? By this time we were all exhausted and keen to leave the city before the afternoon traffic – but Matthew reminded us all a few hundred times that he had never been on a tram – the other kids had Petite France Strasbourg ridden them in Christchurch New Zealand before Matt was born. So we boarded a tram for one stop I think the tram was so modern that it was a disappointment – it looked like a train with very modern carriages back to the car and back along the motorway to our Riquewihr. One highlight for me – on the side of the highway was a self service florist” in a corner of a farm where there was a field of tulips and you could pick your own flowers and then pay for them – another time Ill stop the car to do this! Our last night in Riquewihr and after another lovely walk around the town visiting the witches shop” the Christmas shop” and the Catholic church which we had previously not been to and a visit to the playground that was just outside the town walls we had another lovely meal at one of the restaurants in town – again very authentic because no English was spoken. Steven and I had wanted to try a local specialty a stew starting with B and advertised as a stew of four meats. There are reasons that some dishes become internationally famous and The batarama at Strasbourg others like this one are not known – it was watery plain and really not very nice! Oh well – you have to try these things! Georgia seemed disappointed or at least wanted it known that we were leaving France without eating frogs legs – something for us to try to look for at a restaurant in Brisbane if we cant manage it in Europe! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Kaylene Perissinotto klperissinotto = TP PROFILE START = Former TravelPod Member kperissinotto Joined February 18th 2010 From lives in Australia Favorite Book Favorite Movie Favorite Music Hobbies Languages Bucket List Profession Amazing Event Description = TP PROFILE END =... full info Joined June 12th 2017 Trips 5 Last Login July 23rd 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 254 Guestbook 135 Photos 5220 Forum Posts 0 blog=971581 blogger=371550 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=971581 blogger=371550 Advertisement Brief history of France Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II France suffered extensive losses in its empire wealth manpower and rank as a dominant nation-state.

The Chinese man protested that he had just taken a picture with the i-Phone of his family at the airport departure gate. The policewoman began viewing and deleting pictures from the mans phone as he looked on in bewilderment. When he tried to take his property back the woman told him I am the police. You must do what I say. Oh Really? Welcome to the new and improved Catalonia Spain. We had arrived in Barcelona the night before and were supposed to be flying out the next day to Saigon via Moscow on Aeroflot Airlines. The first thing I noted when we arrived in Barcelonas city center were the large numbers of government security personnel. Besides the city police there were duos of civil guards patrolling the perimeter of the Plaza de Catalunya. Green-fatigue garbed military police armed with automatic pistols and sub-machine guns watched the Plaza from surrounding streets. A very odd sight given my previous visits to Spain had always been peaceful and unremarkable stays. Amber alert? Defcon five? Taliban hate-mail? NSA meta-data? I wasnt quite Spanish Aeroflot Manager This was his favored body language during the entire day. sure what to make of it all as the crowds were primarily Western in origin and couldnt have posed much of a threat given that their mouths were full of Paella and their hands encumbered with shopping bags. Theres something bad happening in Spain and as a culture theyve never coped well with paranoia. Remember that Inquisition thingy they got wrapped up in for... how long was it? Oh yes now I remember Centuries. We headed to the airport the next morning checked our bags cleared passport control and headed to our gate for an 1110 AM departure. At 11 we were informed that the flight was being delayed due to mechanical issues. We looked at the plane sitting forlornly on the jet-way. There was no evidence that any work was being done to the aircraft. The Aeroflot desk was being manned by a trio of Spanish Aeroflot subcontractors who studiously avoided making any eye contact with the passengers. Two guards wearing Vigilante Security Im not making it up name tags blocked the door to the jet-way in case somebody tried to force their way onto the defective plane and fly off with it. At 2 PM they Our Plane I just wanna be fixed. Is that so bad? Is that so awful? announced that the flight was canceled but Aeroflot would do its best to get everyone aboard the scheduled 5 PM flight. At 4 PM we were told that due to limited seating not everyone would be get a spot on the flight. Priority would be given to those folks traveling with children then business class passengers and then frequent flyer members. There were approximately 40 Chinese citizens with small children in our group. They were on their way back home to Beijing after vacationing. The Spanish Aeroflot employees assured the Chinese families that they need not worry as they would all be seated with their kids on the next flight. I was there. I heard them say it. It was a lie. While the now-placated Chinese sat off to the side Aeroflot proceeded to divvy up the available 5 PM seats to all of the Russian and Spanish passengers they could. Armed security personnel started popping up in the gate area where they traded knowing looks with the Aeroflot workers. When the female cop grabbed the guys camera everybody started smelling a large rat. At 5 PM the rat made his appearance. Indeed The Chinese were going nowhere. Hell Aeroflot Russian Manager Took this picture from under my arm as the police were watching anybody with a camera. This woman was the poorest excuse for a corporate rep I have ever met. With me she was dismissive. With the Chinese Hateful. Karen and I were going nowhere. There was another flight to Moscow that night at 11 PM but since Karen and I had NO chance of making a connection to Saigon we figured it best to stay in Barcelona at Aeroflots expense and figure out what we were going to do. We joined the Chinese and Poles at the Aeroflot desk to reschedule. The police remained close by. It took us over three hours to reach the Aeroflot window which was staffed by a single person who did her best to reschedule everyone using a single slow computer. Another woman the Aeroflot manager appeared refused to answer questions and avoided eye contact at any cost. At no point did Aeroflots staff make apologies to any of the passengers. We spent the night at the airport Best Western. Made our flight to Moscow the next morning. Barely made our flight to Vietnam. Unfortunately the only place in Nam Aeroflot could put us into that day was Hanoi which is nearly 1000 miles from Saigon. No problem we had been told the night before by the surly Aeroflot manager in Barcelona. We will assist you in transfer to Ho Chi Minh Aeroflot Desk Closed Scene the next morning when we went back to get our boarding passes. It finally opened 45 minutes later. City and we will make sure your bags arrive safely with you. In Fact Our bags never left Barcelona. We spoke with the Aeroflot manager in Hanoi. Hallelujah! A real human being. He helped us fill out our claim documents gave us some money to purchase toiletry items till our bags arrived and then the guy actually APOLOGIZED for putting us through all this trouble. He didnt know a thing about helping us onward to Saigon so we bought our own tickets and filed another claim. This time with our credit card company. In the end Aeroflot ended up eating our hotel bill for the night. Paid for 6 meals. Reimbursed us for our inconvenience lost two potential customers FOREVER. Aeroflot has quite the business plan. As for the Chinese families We never saw them again. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 8 Displayed 8 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 7 Message Mike Richards Mike and Karen We are Mike and Karen.

We quickly get sick yes we know were a little crazy of a couple of days of holiday at sea read sunbathing swimming reading books and sipping a cold cocktail so we must always spice up the holiday with the exploration of an unknown place. And so we agreed immediately - we wanted to swim in the sea and explore Istria sunbathe and stroll through the tiny streets and to replace ice cream for Istrian cuisine. A four-day trip in Istria was in front of us. On the first day we visited the beautiful less-known Istrian villages which are so adorably mysterious. On the second day we wandered in the ancient Pula explored Kamenjak and visited the famous Safari bar and in the evening we joined in the nightlife of this cosmopolitan city. We spent the third day in Fažana enjoyed a real holiday break and the hot sun. On the last afternoon when we were returning to Slovenia we took the time for a quick stop in Vodnjan and my favourite Istrian seaside town Rovinj. In the morning we headed from Ljubljana to the border crossing Dragonja. Immediately after the border we visited town Momjan. It is a small town with the ruins of the castle which was just being renovated during our visit and the church to which there is a paved road on which we walked in the morning sun rays which are fairly warm despite the early hours. We continued to Mediterranean village of Buje which is about 6 kilometres away and is full of vineyards and olive groves. We parked the car on the edge of the city and walked to the centre on foot. A typical Istrian architecture of the old city centre awaited us white stone houses the orange roofs narrow paved streets leading to the churches of St. Servula protector Buj on one side and St. Mary on the other end. Between the windows of the houses ropes are drawn and fresh laundry is hung on it. You can still smell the fabric softener in the air. In Buje there is the highest belfry in Istria. Renovated wooden stairs lead to the top which are routed around the bell. The view from the top is magnificent I checked! Its a pity that the wind was blowing so much that our hair was all messy so the group picture didnt turn out that well. In front of the church of St. Mary of the Merciful we met an elderly very chatty gentleman. It was quickly obvious that he knows how to speak Slovene Croatian and Italian. He also knew a lot about the history of Istria that once belonged to the Venetian Republic. It was like listening to a live lexicon. Only 12 km from Buje after a little more than 15 minutes’ drive to the southwest and the heart of Istria we reached the village called Grožnjan. This is a village in which we fell in love at first sight. We parked outside the city and continued on foot. The centre of the village is preserved so you can only visit it on foot. The houses here are made of stone and are decorated with green and blue wooden shutters and doors. Grožnjan is a mecca for artists lovers of olive trees and good wine. While exploring the streets we have found countless boutiques galleries studios and small cute shops. In the second half of the 20th century Slovenians brought fine arts in the village which was later joined by musicians. We took the regional road through Oprtalj and quickly saw this historic town its lodge with beautiful frescoes and a bell tower surrounded by typical Istrian houses full of artwork and set off towards the town of Motovun. Cute settlement is located on a high hill above the Mirna river. We had to pay an entrance or parking fee to enter the city and then we drove along the steep road to the parking lot and from there we continued on foot. Only one road leads to the entrance of the old town and on each side of the paved road with granite cubes there are row houses. On the ground floors of the buildings are restaurants which is why it always smells wonderful on this street stores with various souvenirs and pleasant cafés full of guests. We entered through the great yellow walls to the square where you find the fortress the belfry the Baroque church and the palace surrounded by the lovely path. Excited about the town but hungry because we already had some hours of driving and exploration behind us we went to lunch. In a true Istrian tavern we ordered pasta with Istrian truffles. Through the city of Pazin we went to the south of Istria. At the time of the sunset we arrived at Svetvinčenat. The magnificent Renaissance square is surrounded by the stone Grimani Castle with towers and palace the parish church of the Annunciation the town lodge and many Renaissance houses. In the centre you find a town well built in 1808 from a carved stone. Only 7 kilometres from the town of Fažana is the medieval town of Vodnjan known for its graffiti. While walking through the city along the long and flat road that leads to the square with the Venetian style house there are countless graffiti. Not only on the old already forgotten buildings there are graffiti painted by young local graffiti artists on private houses arches and ground floors of the buildings. There are many Gothic Renaissance and Baroque houses in the city where you can sense the Venetian influence. On our way to the home we stopped in the seaside town of Rovinj which is the most beautiful Mediterranean town for me. The view of the old town is the most beautiful from the marina so you can see how the belfry of the church rises above the many houses on a hill. Streets paved by smooth and shiny granite cubes lead uphill to the church but in the middle of countless wonderful small boutiques restaurants bars there are many opportunities to stop for ice cream.

Prior planning is the best when going for a vacation. If you are not prepared you may end up forgetting the obvious yet critical items. So before you jet out observe this handy checklist to ensure everything is in order. These tips will save you time and avoid obvious mistakes. Ensure your Passport is valid An out of date passport can turn your excitement into a nightmare. Few will take time to confirm if their passport is still valid in advance. It is important you do it or you may have to forget about your dream trip. Besides check the countries destination where you are flying to. Some countries have policies where your passport is valid for a certain period from your arrival dates. Do you homework so you know if you require a visa or not. Airlines will not let you board unless you have the relevant visa prior to departure. Secure Your Home Nothing will wreck your holiday memories fast like coming home only to realise it has been broken into. Knowing how to secure your home is imperative. Do a thorough cross-check of the doors windows and ensure they are all in perfect condition. If you have any due deliveries like groceries cancel them. Clean out the fridge trash the garbage pick up the floors water the plants turn off the water unplug and turn off electronics. It is worth to ask a family member or a trusted friend to check on your house. Pause your mail or remove any mail from behind your front door. You do not want to come back to a heap of letters waiting for you. Check your Flight and Confirm Departure Time Navigate to the airline website at least 24 hours before the departure of your first flight. As you do this confirm the departure time as well. The airline might have change the departure time on you so the best action is to call them and confirm. Do not forget to arrive at the airport within the recommended time frame. Check if you have Required Documents for your Trip Have all the essential travelling documents together. Be it your boarding pass driving license or entry visas let them be in one folder. Also take with you some contact details just in case something happens you can contact them. Make copies of everything your passport and itinerary visa leave them with your relative or someone you trust. This could be of help in case you happen to find yourself without your original documents. Take Care of Your Pet Unless you are travelling with your pet organise for care while you are away. Doing this you will have a piece of mind knowing that someone has taken care of your friend. You can organise with a pet sitter or perhaps a home sitter who will look after everything. Inform your Bank It is important to inform your bank when you will be travelling. Let them know if you intend to use your debit card while on holiday. This is because some banks may have geo-restrictions and an overseas activity can cause suspicion and suspend it. You do not want to get your card stopped after enjoying your dream meal. Sort out your Travel Money Do not wait until the last minute to sort out your travel money as it can cost you a lot. You will find the cheapest rates online but you can research online and compare exchange rates. You can however opt for a prepaid card. A prepaid card works on a pay-as-you-go method. All you need is to load the money on the card and then to top it up you call or go online.

Next Entry » Advertisement Middle East » Israel » Tel Aviv District » Tel Aviv March 5th 2006 Published June 21st 2017Edit Blog Post SadikD Tel Aviv The day to fly to Tel Aviv arrived. Altough it was a business trip it was an oportunity to see Israel. When I called the airport in order to check for the flight details Id noticed that I had to be there 4 hours in advance due to the security check!. Arrived at the Amsterdam airport went to the check in desk of El Al. Only difference is that this desk is just slightly different then the other ones. It was in a corner protected with bulletproof glass and there were troopers with automatic guns for protection. Security for EL AL has a very high priority. Once arrived at the check in desk which was a table where every traveler gets an personal interview about the purpose of the travel ethnic background with who you travel and where to stay. After a very intensive interview I passed the first security check. After the passport check at Amsterdam airport we had to go to a special area underground for another intensive check. All the luggage were scanned by different types of X-Ray machines. My Shoes were completely checked if there was not anything which could cause any danger during the Tel Aviv flight. At a certain moment I was afraid that they will do internal research as well… J After passing this security check as well we could board and fly to Tel Aviv… The flight was comfortable and after 5 hours we arrived to David Ben Gurion airport at Tel Aviv. The flight was comfortable and after 5 hours we arrived to David Ben Gurion airport at Tel Aviv and the challenge now was to enter the country. Compared with the security check before the flight entering Israel went without any delays. Just some questions at the passport check but just business as usual. We took a taxi and went to our hotel. When we checked in we realized that our secretary accidentally reserved a room on the Royal Floor of the hotel which was approximately $ 300- A day! Luckily we stayed only for 3 nights otherwise we would hit the limit of our credit cards. After checking in and entering the room we went out for a dinner and explore a bit the boulevard of Tel Aviv. As we had to wake up early for the meetings and we were tired of the travel Tel Aviv we didnt made it late and went to sleep early. The second day when our 3 days of meeting started and ended our 3 days meeting became squeezed into 2 days and we had a day off. A good opportunity to make a daytrip to Jerusalem… Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 7 Displayed 7 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Sadik Deger SadikD Sadik Deger Joined October 19th 2011From lives in VlaardingenNetherlandsLanguages Dutch English German Turkish and FrenchProfession Engineer... full info Joined May 23rd 2017 Trips 8 Last Login February 4th 2020 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 1 Blogs 44 Guestbook 4 Photos 1023 Forum Posts 0 blog=976164 blogger=370429 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=976164 blogger=370429 Advertisement Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Travel Blog » Middle East » Israel » Tel Aviv District » Tel Aviv » Blogs » The flight and security checks... and Te Tot 1.93s Tpl 0.111s cc 10 qc 49 dbt 0.0726s 1 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

Vi ankom til farmen fredag aften eller the caravan som David sagde og det er ogsaa mere korrekt for det var bare en gamel campingvogn med en halvfaerdig/halvbegyndt tilbygning paa siden. Foer vi naaede frem til den havde Magnus vaeret ude og aabne adskillige porte for derefter at lukke dem igen naar vi var koert igennem. Portene var en del af det kilometerlange hegnsystem der deler deres land op i flere omraader saa det er nogenlunde muligt at styre hvilke dyr der gaar hvor. Og med dyr menes der kvaeg faar og 3 heste. David mener at han har lidt under 100 stykker kvaeg og omkring 50-60 faar. Stedet havde ikke rindende vand eller elektricitet i hvert fald ik udover det 12-volts batteri der lige kunne drive et par halogenlamper saa det var forholdsvist primitivt men det gjorde ikke noget. Loerdag stod vi tidligt op og gik i gang med at arbejde det vil sige at jegEmil lige foerst skulle laere at koere paa motorcykel/motorcross op til det skur hvor den anden motorcykel som Magnus skulle koere paa og quadbiken som David skulle bruge stod. Saa ja P1000590 vi har koert rundt paa motorcykel loerdag og soendag naesten al den tid vi ikke arbejdede. Maengden af beskyttelsesudstyr fremgaar tydeligt af billederne saa det behoever vi ikke udtale os om.. Arbejdet bestod i foerste omgang i at faa samlet koerne sammen og ind i en fold hvorefter de alle blevet sluset kontrolleret ud igen saa David kunne faa tjekket alt kvaeget for daarlige oejne og andre skavanker. Derudover var der ogsaa to kalve der skulle maerkes og den ene af dem var en tyrekalv og skulle ogsa kastreres! Det foregik ved at jegEmil maatte sidde paa kalven og holde den nogenlunde stille mens David vha. en speciel tang paafoerte en meget stram elastik omkring kalvens testikler. Elastikken lukker for blodtilfoerslen og udfoerer kastreringen lige saa stille! Magnus og mig holdt 1 minuts stilhed for kalvens fremtidige men knap saa sjove liv.. Efter koerne var ordnet var der lidt forskelligt maintenance arbejde vi ogsaa hjalp med saa som at pumpe vand fra den meget indtoerrede flod op til koernes vandhuller. Senere paa dagen efter vi havde koert adskillige kilometer rundt i det bakkede landskab paa vores nye legetoej hjalp vi ogsaa med at faa samlet faarene ind og P1000591 faa dem igennem slusesystemet. Et af faarene fik ikke lov til at komme med de andre ud i friheden det skulle nemlig med hjem til koeleskabet. Men om det var mest syndt for faaret der fik skaaret halsen over eller min lyse t-shirt der blev offer for nogle blodpletter ved vi ikke.. I hvert fald hjalp vi med at faa slagtet faaret og haengt det op saa vi kunne tage koedet med hjem soendag. Soendag gik ogsaa med at koere en del paa motorcykel jagte undslupne faar og andre smaating. Vi koerte hjem til Canberra igen soendag eftermiddag. Vi havde en super fed weekend! Og vi fik lige set lidt af det australske farmer liv 😊 Vi haaber i alle har det godt i kolde Danmark vi render rundt og sveder men vi har det rigtig godt!

On a few levels actually. Last year I straight-away lost my SLR camera ice fishing on Abashiri lake. Long story...! and it was too windy to go out on the boats to see the drift ice. So this year I had high hopes of getting to see ice. One of my building mates went the weekend before and saw loads of ice so I felt pretty confident it would happen this year. My co-worker Olivia decided to make the trek with me. There was a bit of drama involving me getting to the train and we just barely made it! The ride up there was pretty uneventful. We just chatted and slept. We pulled in to Abashiri Station at 1100pm and met the other guy who had been on the train with us. Our hostJames was also waiting with his car. We decided what to do...go home get a bite...and we decided to go home because James had made pumpkin pie and gingerbread cookies! It was a good thing too because the other gents we were going to meet scuba divers up with had come back then anyway. The pumpkin pie was delicious! Nic had brough Louie his dog and I took to playing with Louie straight away. Andy was also there and I gave my puri-kula buddy a gargantuous hug! So we sat around chatting and eating for a few hours sorted out sleeping arrangements and went to bed. When we woke up the next morning James had made a breakfast pie. MMmmmm. It was soooo delicious. I made some coffee with Baileys cinnamon ginger and nutmeg. Yum! We called about the drift ice boat and it wasnt going out. Grrrr! So instead we loaded up our cars and went to the coast to see washed up ice. Unfortuantly there was not nearly the amount there was last year but it was still beautiful. really how much can you expect from nature? When we got down to the shoreline there were divers collecting something klione maybe? and they were standing knee-deep literally in ice water...Brrrr! there is NO way I would do that! Ok granted they were wearing suits and skins but stilll! We took a few pictures and proceeded to walk around the cliffs. The cliffs drift ice were rather treacherous as they were pretty much just covered in ice or snow. I was just wearing my regular boots so I was a tad hesitant. Olivia was too but we gambarimasu-ed and squeezed around. On the other side was a little beach! It was so delicate. Sand met snow and summer grasses turned to straw bravely sticking out of the snow. We walked around the backside of the next cliff to a bigger beach and a shoreline that stretched lazily along. Washed up drift ice littered the beach. Andy was wearing his Ninja mask and took to leaping around showing his ninja moves in the snow. I think we were all pretty amazed at just how beautiful it was we kinda forgot about the cold. Olivia collected icicles and then she and Andy rescued a piece of drift ice from the sea. It took them quite a few minutes! and apparantly it was quite heavy. I didnt know that when the ice freezes all the salt goes into the water and there is no salt in the ice. Interesting eh? I thought the water might be murky from the salt but James said its because the Nik & Louie water is so cold. Everyone kinda flitted about a bit. Louie was loving the snow! I kept trying to get a good photo but he doesnt like to sit still! We made the walk back to where we started and the other people joining our party showed up. I guess there were 12 of us in all. We sat around me on the ice for a bit and chatted until we got too cold. My butt was of the verge of shimoyake I think!frostbite! We went in a nearby hotel and took a look at their giftshop. I got some postcards and kitty keitai strap for my sad and pathetic collection. why oh why am i such a sucker! Everyone was trying to take pictures of the klione in a small tank. Unfortuantly my camera didnt get any good ones. Klione are small but not always clear angel shaped creatures with little cat like ears. Their innards glow and sometimes you can see their heart. They are really quite cool. Then it was off to lunch at a new pizza place. Andy Olivia and I shared food. All I can say is yum! Pizza pasta salad I love snow rosemary foccacia cake tiramisu and coffee! A feast! We spent ages and ages there then went back to the house. Andy and I wanted to do puri-kula so while everyone rested we went off to the game center. We played some games and did puri-kula twice. We werent quite ready to head back yet so we stopped at Off House and had a look. they had a great selection of stuff and Andy and I got lost in the music section. James rang and pulled us out of our cd stupor. He wanted bread for the next mornings French Toast feast. We got bread and proceeded back to the house. Oh I forgot to mention I was driving! Yeah! Andy let me drive! I have a J-license but no car so driving is always a good time. But i didnt know where I was going and he always gets lost so we had to turn around a lot! When we got back everyone was lounging. We got ourselves together and headed off to Abashiri Festival for some fun on the slides. OMG it was fun...I think I never grew out of my kid stage. Andy and I P2231003 ran around taking pictures of sculptures and racing down the slides....Wheeeee!!! Next was the bathhouse. It was pretty uneventful except that Olivia got her towel wet er soaked and didnt have anything to dry off with...so I patted down and let her use my towel and I blow-dryed myself! When we finally finished sorting ourselves out we hurried off to Indian/Nepalese food. They had prepared a feast and we all totally gorged ourselves. No one was up for going out except Andy and Nic! and they wanted to do karaoke on a full stomach... so we just headed back to the house. I drove again. This time Patrick was in the car with us but we still got lost! Ah were hopeless! We went in search of yuki ichigo layer of cake with a strawberry in the middle cream on top of that and wrapped in mochi but no such luck.... By the time we made it back to the house theyd given up on us and locked the door! We sat around talking and watching youtube. After youtube it turned to politics....hmmm. Anyway everyone has a totally different view. It was interesting to hear the P2231018 non-US people comment on our system and who should win and why...blah blah blah Finally went to bed. Michael joined our room. My face was cold and I curled up to the sliding doors and my backpack. In the a.m. Nik came to wake us up for breakfast. Olivia could not be moved/woken. So I went down and ate some French toast and made James and Andy my coffee specialty. Six of the gents had to leave so they did. Leaving the rest of us to our own devices. The boat wasnt out because it was too windy. While we were sleeping massive amounts of snow had fallen. So much that flights trains and buses were canceled or delayed. I think about 1 meter of snow fell overnite....on top of the snow that was already piled up! Because of the immense collection of sudden snowfall no trains/buses/flights were on time. We olivia and I were scheduled to bust out at 515p.m. but Olivia didnt want to get back so late so she decided to get the 2p.m. train. I didnt want to have to possibly stand the whole way so I said No thanks! I would wait for Any & Olivia w/ they drift ice they resued my reserved train. We then talked about going for a hike but no one could be bothered to move so we just sat around until it was time for Michael AUS and Olivia to go. When James got back we had some baklava yum! and Nick and Patrick took off. Andy decided to stay a bit longer. James and I headed out around 4. We went to the park so I could maybe see drift ice. The snow was incredibly deep and the path totally covered. We finally made it through to the fence-line and I could see the ocean! It was AMAZING! sigh....I saw an eagle and about 5-6 swans flying overhead. Off in the distance I could see a few pieces of drift ice. So we sat out there for a few minutes and trudged back to the car. It was about time to catch my train so we headed to the station. Only had about 20 minutes till the train arrived 40 minutes late~! So I got some conbini food and said my goodbyes... the 5 hour train ride only took 6! Yeah~! and it was virtually empty so I got good sleep! well for Klione a train which really isnt good sleep at all! I hope the 3rd time is a charm because I REALLY REALLY want to see drift ice before I leave Japan....Next year is my last chance...! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 18 Displayed 18 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Jessica Stutte boshemianjesi Tell us a bit about yourself this information will appear on your page and can be edited later.

It went via Paris where it made two stops in the suburbs and this was the slowest part of the trip. The train sat on 320 km/h for long periods on the run east from Paris. I arrived in Strasbourg at 7pm and checked in to the hotel which was close to the station. Then I headed out to find some dinner crossing the river onto the Grand Île of Strasbourg which is the old city. Google directed me to a completely gluten-free restaurant which was a great find! I was able to have a more normal meal with confidence that it would be GF. I am a bit sick of galettes. I followed up with a piece of fabulous berry meringue pie for dessert. I then headed off into the historic and picturesque part of Strasbourg known as La Petite France. The canals parks squares and medieval streets were beautiful as evening was falling. Being so close to Germany and in fact having been part of Germany several times this region has a German flavour in many ways seen in the architecture especially. Strasbourg being Cathédrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg a popular tourism destination and the seat of the European Parliament is also very multilingual and a lot of people were speaking German or English. I made my way to see the cathedral – Notre Dame de Strasbourg. Really impossible to describe in words looming in splendid enormity over the city its towering form richly decorated and incredibly tall – the bell tower reaches 134 metres. One has to crane ones neck to gaze up its flanks of soaring stone. An extraordinary building. There was a cellist busking outside the cathedral which added to the atmosphere. After a while I made my way back through the nighttime streets to my hotel. Sunday 23rd June I checked out and put my suitcase in the luggage room at the hotel and headed off for the 20 minutes walk to go to Mass at the cathedral. The interior is as extraordinary as the exterior – just the vast height of the nave and choir is incredible. The Mass was superb concelebrated by nine priests with attendant historical guard armed with mace and pike. The celebrants looked like midgets on the vast area of the choir set about Strasbourg – Ill River & Reformed Church of Saint Paul 3 metres higher than the congregation. The grand organ was accompanied by a mens choir who had come from Nuremberg – the music was sublime. The wonderful stained glass let in light through the high walls and the church bells outside rang out at various times through the celebration. It was quite a privilege to experience. After Mass I had a chance for a quick look around the cathedral before we tourists were ushered out before the next Mass – the cathedral is closed to non-Mass-goers on Sunday morning. Unfortunately the ubiquitous works going on meant that the famous astronomical clock could not be viewed – quel dommage. The clock was working though one could hear its chimes every 15 minutes during the Mass. I will have to download a photo of it – I was just able to glimpse it through the hoardings. I then had a long walk along the river to see the European parliament buildings and then took the tram back to town and explored La Petite France some more before a picnic lunch beside the river. It was a beautiful warm day and in the shade with a gentle breeze it was very Evening in Strasbourg pleasant so I had a half-hour snooze as well. Then a walk through the city back to the hotel and to the station for the TER train to Mulhouse. This was quite a large train locomotive hauled. As I am a bit of a railway enthusiast I have noted a few things about the railways in this area of France a lot of the infrastructure most notably the overhead catenary is of German type. In most of France the trains run on the left-hand track when its a double line like in Australia but the train south from Strasbourg ran on the right-hand side like in Germany. Of course this region has been German a few times and line runs close to the Rhine the border but I was surprised the train would run on the right side while still in France. I am now ensconced in my hotel in Mulhouse – an attractive art deco building which is why I chose it. Luckily the room has air conditioning as it is hot and the forecast is for a bit of a heatwave this coming week. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 12 Displayed 12 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message davros9 davros9 Joined March 24th 2015 Trips 2 Last Login April 28th 2020 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 1 Blogs 69 Guestbook 66 Photos 599 Forum Posts 1 blog=1036452 blogger=313184 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1036452 blogger=313184 Advertisement Brief history of France Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II France suffered extensive losses in its empire wealth manpower and rank as a dominant nation-state.

Holon - Third in a series of experiential off the beaten path tours to encounter and appreciate other important religious communities in Israel led by licenced tour guide Rina Yellin. The city of Holon is located south of Tel Aviv. See our blogs Day around the Carmel in Israel - January 2016 and Day tour of Minorities in the Galil - April 2016 for the two previous tours with Rina. Our Samaritan Shomronim Holon tour began with a visit to the Samaritans during their Sukkot holiday. We started in the house of Benyamim Tsedaka an elder and head of the Israelite Samaritan Information Institute  www.israelite-samaritans.com . As we walked in we were confronted with a beautifully decorated sukkah in the middle of the living room and greeted by Binyamim who said call me Ben or Benny. Ben worked for the Jewish Agency for 25 years and can count 125 generations in Israel. He met his wife Miriam at the age of 23 at the Hebrew University. Miriam is originally from Romania. As well as speaking modern Hebrew the Samaritans speak ancient Hebrew. During the second Temple period the Jews started to read write and speak Samaritan Institute & Ben Tsedaka’s home Aramaic but the Samaritans retained ancient Hebrew as their language. So how do the Samaritans celebrate their Judaism? They adhere to the Laws as written in the Torah. They do not take into consideration Rabbinic Jewry which is how the rabbis have interpreted the laws in Torah. So during Sukkot they do not wave the four species in the synagogue as it is not mandated in the Torah. Instead the sukkah itself is decorated with the four species along with fruits of the season grapefruits pomegranates and aubergines eggplants for contrast in colour. Hanging from the middle of the sukkah roof was the largest etrog I have seen! The roof is made of palm leaves and attached to the sukkah was the branch of a eucalyptus tree - although the branch of any tree would suffice. There were also plants from the river. The reason for the sukkah being inside the house is because of the pogroms some 1500 years ago and many were killed and so the priests decided that they move their sukkot inside to lessen their chances of being killed. They do not live in the sukkah nor do they eat and sleep in paintings by Miriam Tsedaka the sukkah but merely sit in it during the days of the festival. The Jewish calendar and the Samaritan calendar differ because the Jewish calendar is calculated from the date of creation whereas the Samaritan calendar is calculated from the date that Joshua Ben Nun entered the land of Israel. Hence this year the Samaritans celebrate Sukkot approximately one month after the Jewish festival of Sukkot. Monies saved during the year are spent on the festivals of Sukkot and Pesach. During Pesach the whole community ups and goes on pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim where the Samaritans still carry out the Passover sacrifice every year. Some of the differences between Samaritan religion and Judaism 1. Fundamental love for the land of Israel - the Samaritans do not want to leave Israel. They receive many enquiries from around the world from people researching their roots. They do not believe in missionaries but if a man marries out of the community there is no form of conversion - rather his wife joins the community. 2. Shabbat is observed in the strictest manner. No electric timers are used so any necessary lights are Mezuzah in Ancient Hebrew simply left on. Likewise the food fully cooked before Shabbat is placed under a hot towel to keep it warm but not upon a hot-plate which would turn on and off. 3. The Passover sacrifice is still performed. 4. Family purity is observed in the strictest of ways. When a woman is in her period she stays in a special room in the house for seven days. She has full freedom but there is complete separation. The husband and the children take over all the duties of the household. At the end of seven days the woman bathes in a bath with running water. The formal mikveh is something which the rabbis formulated and is not written in the Torah so the Samaritans do not require it. If a woman has a baby boy she is in purdah for 41 days and for a baby girl 80 days as mandated in the Torah. This is a very private time for the woman. The Samaritan mezuzah is a very interesting thing. It is not a scroll on every doorpost in the house but typically etched on a stone block at the front door. Just inside Bens Samaritan synagogue in Holon home is a needlework tapestry of a mezuzah in Ancient Hebrew. We saw other examples outside Samaritan houses in the village and at the gate of the synagogue. The star of David is not used anywhere as this is a relatively modern symbol. The Samaritans use the symbol of the menorah. We walked around the village and went to the synagogue. Samaritan synagogues face Mount Gerizim the holy place where the Samaritan tabernacle was established long ago. The synagogue was closed as it is only opened on the Shabbat and on festive days. There are seven holidays * the first day of the Passover and the seventh day of Passover * Shavuot * the first day of the 7th month which Jews call Rosh Hashanah - whereas the Samaritan year starts at the beginning of the first month Nissan two weeks before Passover * Yom Kippur * the first day of Sukkot and the eighth day Shemini Atzeret. In addition they have added Yom Ha’Atzmaut Israel Independence Day to their holidays. Prayers are said twice every day but privately in their own homes. Women do not go to the synagogue. Everyone Samaritan Synagogue gate fasts on Yom Kippur including babies from the time they are weaned. There are two cemeteries one in the Tel Aviv area and the other by Mount Gerizim near Nablus. They have a school for teaching about the Samaritan religion after regular school hours. The children attend one of two schools locally - a Palestinian school or the local Israeli school. We said goodbye and thanks to Benyamim after a very informative several hours and went off to the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School. Mikveh Israel Agricultural village is currently 750 acres of green agricultural land nestled in the midst of the high rise world of Tel Aviv and Holon. It was founded in 1870 by Charles Netter. Today there are three schools on the site - one for children from dati leumi orthodox families one for children from the secular world and one which boards kids many from troubled families. The name Mikveh Israel comes from Jeremiah and means hope of Israel”. In 1970 David Ben-Gurion visited on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the organisation. Ben-Gurion said that without Mikveh Israel the nation would Cave - first schoolroom of Mikveh Israel not have grown and may not even have been established. Charles Netter an agronomist was sent to Israel by a French organisation called Alliance Israelite Universelle. This organisation had been set up to establish agricultural schools in Africa. In 1870 it was decided to send somebody to Palestine as Israel was then known to establish a school. They purchased a tract of land from the Turkish sultan just northeast of Jaffa. Charles Netter was looking for students and went to Jerusalem. His first student was a youth whom he spotted eating a watermelon. The boy was putting the seeds into his pocket. When Netter asked him why he was saving the seeds the boy said that he wanted more watermelons. This seemed like a likely scholar. The boy’s mother was exceedingly poor and saw it as a way of improving the family’s financial situation and giving the boy an education. Netter and his pupil initially lived in the cave which was the first stop on our tour. We ate our lunch in the picnic area which was in the eucalyptus grove. Eucalyptus trees are not native to Israel but they were introduced with a Look toward Tel Aviv road for Herzl statue view to drying up the swamps. However eucalyptus trees are very frugal with water and so the idea failed. The eucalyptus was introduced by Horatio Spafford who was a staunch Presbyterian who after a series of personal tragedies came to Jerusalem and founded the American Colony. He was responsible for helping those who came to Israel on the First Aliyah in 1852 and also the Yemenites who were not accepted at first. According to Mark Twain in Innocents Abroad who visited Israel in 1867 the land that Netter subsequently purchased was barren tree-less land with no shade and a dismal landscape. The area was surrounded by Arab villages. Why this parcel of land? Because there was a water supply and there was a source of labour nearby. From a distance we saw the place where Theodor Herzl met Kaiser Wilhelm II on his one and only visit to Israel in 1898 recently marked with a statue by the main road. This meeting was organised thanks to Leah Niego the wife of Joseph Niego who was the General Manager of Mikveh Israel for fifteen years. Leah was in Tel Aviv and saw a hubbub and Rina explains Herzl photo by Ficus Bengali tree outside the synagogue realised it was Herzl and his entourage. The entourage arranged everything but they forgot a horse and buggy. She told Herzl to come to Mikveh Israel and she let him use a horse and buggy from the school. The meeting was organised for a place along the main route from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Rina told us about a famous picture of Herzl and the Kaiser which was widely published at the time. The photographer rushed to capture the scene of Herzl standing on the gound and greeting the Kaiser riding his horse. In fact the photographer managed to capture left to right one of the Kaisers aids on a black horse the back end of the white horse upon which the Kaiser was seated and a leg of Herzl. The published photo has the Kaiser instead of his aid sitting on the black horse and the fully standing Herzl - actually an image of Herzl acquired from a different photograph - facing the Kaiser directly. So we learned that the PhotoShop technique stems from the 19th century! We visited the synagogue which is truly beautiful. Because there are Sephardi and Ashkenazi pupils there are two pulpits. Mikveh Israel Synagogue The décor is a mixture of all of the styles in Israel at that time. For example there are Templar style doors with a plaque in Hebrew Arabic French and English and a dark brown plough and a cluster of grapes. Inside there is Turkish influence in the paintings on the ceiling - although it is also rumoured that they were painted by Chinese painters! In 1970 the synagogue was restored. Outside the synagogue is the oldest tree a Ficus Bengali or Banyan weeping date tree. The tree appears to have numerous trunks but in fact it has just one true original trunk. These additional trunks” are branches which have bent over and after they touched the ground they took root. If you stand at the main door and look back you can see the straight boulevard which leads to the school’s main entrance which is flanked by palm trees. The school is a National Heritage site and the head office of The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel. Their logo is the facade of the Herzliya Gymnasium. That was Israel’s first Hebrew high school which was established in 1905 and it became a symbol Rina describes Mikveh Israel Synagogue for the importance of preserving heritage sites. Even so today Mikveh Israel is a modern fully functioning school refining agricultural technology and techniques with an experimental botanical garden facilities for raising horses and farm animals etc. . Then we went down into the winery. This was constructed in 1873 and is deep down underground. The workers dug into the limestone to construct four arched underground chambers. This winery played a vital role during the War of Independence. It was the place where new recruits both male and female took the oath of allegiance to the Hagenah military organisation. The oath was taken on a Bible whilst holding a gun. It was also the place where weapons and ammunition were stored and hidden. In fact when they were restoring some of the limestone in modern times a stash of bullets was unearthed. We sat and watched a film about Mikveh Israel whilst drinking a glass of the wine produced there! Our final stop on the tour was the machina also known as the blacksmith work shop. It was intended that the whole school site be independent and not reliant on outsiders to repair and make tools. Davidka mortar in Mikveh Israel workshop Some of the machinery is still working. It was in this workshop that the Davidka mortar was invented. The inventor was David Leibovitch. The mortar was very noisy and inaccurate. In one notable incident the Davidka was used against an Arab insurgency in Tsfad. It went off with such a bang and created such a huge crater in the middle of the market that the Arabs just upped and left in fear particularly as just then rain began falling during what was normally the dry season and the rumour quickly spread that this was nuclear fallout.

America Travel Blog » Asia » Malaysia » Johor » Johor Bahru » Blogs » JB - A Border Town Johor Bahru Malaysi JB - A Border Town Johor Bahru Malaysia - January 2020 « Previous Entry Advertisement Asia » Malaysia » Johor » Johor Bahru January 31st 2020 Published January 29th 2020Edit Blog Post ThatTravelingWoman DSCN0932 After years of being habitually criticized as a dirty and chaotic border town Johor’s capital city of Johor Bahru JB for short has been repaved and replanted and is well on the way to rebranding itself as a major tourist destination. Most travelers skip southern Malaysia’s largest city in favor of Kuala Lumpur or the Cameroon Highlands up north but for some intrepid souls there’s a handful of worthwhile museums temples mosques shopping and even party zones right here. And should these not be your thing” JB also has a Legoland where everything is supposedly awesome”. Personally I’ll take dibs on the museums and party zones - I’m not a Legoland kind of girl. A massive construction effort is currently in progress which will radically change southern Malaysia over the next decade and JB is about to undergo one hell of a makeover. Located just 3 miles from the Causeway in the Danga Bay area one of the five economic zones of the Iskandar Development Project is poised to become a financial and commercial center. Work on this development began in 2006 and is expected to be completed in 2025. Right now Danga Bay is simply an ugly construction sprawl. DSCN0934 A little bit of history Compared to most world cities JB is very young…..founded in 1855 and called Iskandar Puteri when the region was known as the Sultanate of Johor the city was renamed in 1862 when it became the capital of this Sultanate. During WWII Japanese forces occupied the city from 1942 to 1945 as they prepared to invade Singapore and push the British out of the Malay Peninsula. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963 the city retained its status as the state capital and gained city status in 1964. With a population of about 1.4 million in the city and 2 million in the metro area it makes JB the second most populous city in Malaysia. A bustling city but one with little of interest for the casual tourist it is a significant regional transport and manufacturing hub. Given its relatively large land space the town is not as dense as other cities around Malaysia. Due to its proximity to Singapore it unavoidably suffers from comparison with its neighbor. Recent clean-up initiatives like greening the city and covering the open sewers that until a few years ago ran through DSCN0935 the center of the city have made it a more pleasant place to live. However even up to now there has been little efforts in maintaining buildings and public facilities and even the city center may seem run-down to some. Though appreciably less organized and much messier compared to the glitz of Singapore shopping and eating in the city can be a real adventure with many shopping complexes and a wide variety of food establishments offering budget to fine dining. Johor Bahru is probably more well known as an industrial city rather than a tourist-friendly town. Many of the worlds top electronics manufacturers have at least one plant in Johor Bahru and after the tough times after the 1997 economic crisis the town is stirring to life again. Having arrived in Singapore in the early morning I had made prior arrangements for a car and driver transfer to the Doubletree Hotel in downtown JB. It began with an easy no-brainer clearance of immigration and customs at the cruise ship terminal and within an hour I set a record of clearing two more sets of immigration to leave Singapore and enter Malaysia before finally arriving DSCN0936 at the hotel. It was definitely a first for me drive-thru” immigration process? So cool. I reclined in air-conditioned comfort while my driver handed our passports to immigration officers sitting in small booths reminiscent of a Sonic Drive-thru fast food joint and with a simple glance into the vehicle we were granted exit and access for both countries. The traffic was so dense it took 40 minutes to complete the entire double process – evidently crossing this border is an exercise in patience on weekends. Shortly after noon I was ushered into the wide lobby of the Doubletree and whisked up to the 29th roof-top floor to check-in at the Executive Lounge. This is one fantastic setting I see many evenings in here sipping cocktails and watching sunsets. I’m used to being upgraded and was certainly not disappointed this time. A suite on the 27th floor with living room kitchenette dining area fabulous bathroom and a washing machine! By the end of my stay here that will come in handy. Fresh fruit chocolates and water by the bedside completed my satisfaction as a home-away-from-home. Unparalleled views from the bedroom and living room with sweeping vistas across the DSCN0937 city as far as the eye could see. I stopped by the lounge later in the evening to enjoy a delicious dinner buffet spread and then called it a night – time to sink into the famous Hilton Dream Bed. One of the more popular tourist attractions here is the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple which is a sight to behold! The oldest temple in Tebrau it has been listed in the Malaysian Book of Records. A creation of Guru Sri Sinnathamby Sivasamy this unique temple is embellished with 300000 pieces of red blue yellow green purple and white glass including its floors pillars and walls. Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling. As an active place of worship it is necessary for visitors to dress modestly and maintain location tranquilly. It is open daily for tourists from 1 to 5pm with free admission. Another must see” on any tourist list is the magnificent Sultan Abu Bakar Mosque considered one of the most beautiful old mosques in Malaysia. Boasting of Victorian architecture the mosque was constructed between the years 1892 and 1900. Commissioned by the ‘Father of Modern Johor’ the late Sultan Abu Bakar the DSCN0938 2 mosque can accommodate 2000 worshippers at any given time. For the very budget-minded tourist Holiday Plaza is one of the oldest shopping malls in Johor Bahru. If you are not looking for boutique shops to peek in and prefer shopping in less expensive centers then this is the place for you. The prices are very cheap here with highlights that include salons DVD stores massage centers and phone accessory stores. The food options are somewhat on the lower side. Open every day from 10 am to 10pm. I arrived in southeast Asia at the beginning of the longest annual holiday Chinese New Year also called the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year. It starts this year on January 20th and ends on February 8th but the actual New Year’s Day is celebrated on Saturday January 25th. It’s the Year of the Rat and is the first in order of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals. According to one folktale the Jade Emperor decided that the order of the animals would be determined according to the order by which they arrived at his party. This zodiac’s animal cleverly convinced the Ox to give him a ride. Just as the pair arrived at the door the Rat jumped ahead and landed before the Ox. Being the most important event on the Chinese calendar most hotels and restaurants within the city are going full blast with New Year celebrations and the Doubletree is right in the thick of it. A special oriental feast of five different buffets will be offered in the all-day dining Makan Restaurant prepared by master chefs featuring Fortune Feast Buffet Dinner Prosperity Buffet Dinner Chinese New Year Eve and Day Dinners Chinese New Year Day High Tea Buffet and a group dining Reunion table for private banquet events. Prices range from RM98 $24.18 to RM188 $46.40 adult. I can’t wait to see what goodies show up in the form of canapes during evening cocktail hours in the lounge. The weather has not cooperated much since my arrival. Every day it’s hot and humid – to be expected in this region – but frequent and often heavy rain showers really put the damper on sightseeing. Sometimes it’s heavy enough to shut down the satellite television broadcast not to mention swamping the roads and turning them into fast moving streams. Thick white mists blanket the entire city so dense it’s a virtual white out” obliterating everything from sight. Public transportation exists here but is very iffy” at best. Buses may or may not arrive on time with bus stops being practically impossible to find. Best way to move around is via taxi or on the ankle express aka your feet. Given the everyday heat and humidity taxis tend to be your best bet overall and they are reasonable cost wise. There are plans to build a light rail transit network in the near future however I wouldn’t hold my breath on that. New Year’s Day dawned bright and sunny along with the sound of Chinese firecrackers echoing around the buildings and sounding like AK-47s putting on a concert. The closer to midnight it got the more firework displays were prominent against the night sky – they continued until the early morning hours as people celebrated in the streets welcoming in the Year of the Rat. This hotel had been sold out for the entire weekend but guest count dropped off dramatically by Monday…. evidently not everyone gets two weeks’ vacation during this holiday. This city is definitely worth a visit if you have kids if not not so much. With Legoland and the Angry Birds Park amusements kids go wild to visit and spend the day – I avoided both. I’m glad I made the trip but it certainly isn’t one I would make again it simply doesn’t have the usual tourist attractions which bring crowds of visitors. On the plus side it’s very affordable. On the negative the weather is crazy you never know what is coming next – having watched three major storms sweep across the hotel in the past 5 days complete with lightning thunder and torrential rains I can certainly attest to that. And don’t even get me started on lack of public transportation or difficulty of getting around overall. Now it’s time to head back to civilization aka Las Vegas. Granted there are many which would debate my city being even in the ballpark for that but it’s still home to me. Until the next adventure…..selamat tinggal goodbye as they say in JB. « Previous Entry Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 3 Message Traveling Woman ThatTravelingWoman Im a world-traveling gypsy with jet fuel instead of blood in my veins!

In fact we had just about given up hope of seeing a familiar face when we pulled into the car park of the Peterborough Visitors Centre and nearly ran Dave over. We had morning tea with Dave Clare Michael and Tim and spent a nice couple of hours in Peterborough. It has the largest hall in inland South Australia no less. It also has quite a bit of interesting railway history but we couldn’t linger so we left all that for another day. Broken Hill on the decline from its halcyon days as the site of the richest silver-lead-zinc lode in the world is quite a nice place with a real mixture Broken Hill - Flying Doctor of things to see. We looked in on the School of the Air mainly because Sharon’s sister Jeanette used to be principal there. We sat in on a kindergarten lesson which for us novices was quite a hoot. We also spoke to one of the staff members who remembered Jeanette most fondly. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has a base in Broken Hill. The tour was interesting enough and the short film is a real tear-jerker. Apart that is from the dental patient. A pleasant friendly old bushie he seems quite ok until he opens his mouth to reveal the most revolting set of crooked stained bleeding and decayed stumps you will ever see. The mining connection we covered firstly with a trip out to the Daydream Mine and an underground tour. Interestingly the pioneer miners didn’t need to have room to lie down in their sleeping quarters – they were generally so riddled with lung disease that they could only sleep sitting up anyway. The second part of our mine experience was a visit to the Miners’ Memorial perched on the top of the giant mullock heap that has replaced the Barrier Range in the Broken Hill - Miners Memorial middle of town. The memorial lists all the employees who have died on the job at the mines – from the first cases of lead poisoning to a veritable epidemic of heart attacks in the 1960’s to the odd crushed by machine” or electrocuted” these days. It was certainly a hard way to earn a living from the time of the Daydream Mine right through to the present day. To cover the absolute cornucopia of attractions on offer we also had a malted at Bell’s Milk Bar stuck in the 60’s and with an interesting milk bar museum attached looked in at the Palace Hotel made famous in Priscilla Queen of the Desert” and drove out to the Sculptures in the Desert and the old town of Silverton. From there it was an easy drive to Nyngan for a night then Armidale then home. We covered 9700 kilometres in just over 5 weeks and were really surprised at how easy the trip was. The old commodore did it with ease and an ever-increasing number of rattles. The drinking water and engine oil we carried as a precaution remained untouched. While we didn’t venture far away from Broken Hill - Bells Milk Bar civilization we did get a good taste of a unique part of the country – a part that every city-dweller should visit. And do it soon as there are a lot of visitors. Some of the rest stops especially those that don’t have a toilet are starting to show the effect of too many overnight camps. Perhaps people will be needed soon to direct the hoards of grey nomads and yes we are not far from that category ourselves around the country perhaps with some sort of one-way system. Our next instalment will be in a few weeks – somewhere overseas but we’re not sure exactly where. We’ll keep you posted. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 12 Displayed 12 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Chris and Sharon Dickson thedickosgapyear A year away from the treadmill...... full info Joined February 7th 2011 Trips 2 Last Login January 17th 2012 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 25 Guestbook 95 Photos 566 Forum Posts 0 blog=654615 blogger=190337 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=654615 blogger=190337 Advertisement Trips Southern Australia February 14th 2011 -» March 27th 2011 Europe 2011 April 30th 2011 -» July 5th 2011 Broken Hill - Brownes Shaft Broken Hill - Desert Sculpture Broken Hill - Desert Sculpture Silverton Mundi Mundi Plains Broken Hill - From the Miners Memorial Broken Hill - From the Miners Memorial Broken Hill - Palace Hotel 29th September 2011 Jack non-member comment More nice pics Yo Digger and Shaz!

I cant seem to find them any more. Continue to have fun! Jack. 30th September 2011 Jack non-member comment Nguzu-nguzu I had to look at this twice to check that I was seeing right. This looks remarkably like a Nguzu-nguzu. Throughout the Solomon Islands - all provinces- there are representations usually carved in wood of Nguzu-nguzu the shark god who theoretically protects people. I dont think it works. i had been swimming in a particular area and asked if there were sharks. Nope. No sharks and Nguzu-nguzu will protect you anyway. Following week a small ferry with 96 people went down in the same area and all of them were eaten by Nguzu-nguzus. Yep.... that one worked!

We had booked the earliest train for 5.55am which meant an early start. We planned an early night before but this didnt work out so we had to stay awake all night. We left the Nantra at about half 4 and got a taxi to the train station 30mins away. This cost about £3 and cost less than the 5minute journey we got at the start of the trip when we had mug wrote on our heads. We got our tickets for the six hour train journey for 48baht £1.20 and sat on the last carraige. There was about 5 other backpackers and the rest were locals. We found a double seat next to the window and enjoyed the view of the Thai countryside for the 6hours with no problems. The rest of the border crossing wasnt so smooth. We got off the train at the last stop in Thailand Aranprathet and organised a tuk tuk the rest of the road to Cambodia. This was our first tuk tuk and it showed. I thought it was similar to the Nemesis at Alton Towers and shit a brick. The tuk tuk dropped us off at a cambodian visa place where SDC11983 it was necessary to buy a Visa before we had even got into Cambodia. We had read this would happen and ignored the offers and walked the rest of the way to the border. Loads of other people were persuaded however. We got to Thai immigration and stamped out within 5minutes. Everything was a breeze. Then we stepped over the line into Cambodia where the drama started... Form number 1 a health declaration what I dont think was necessary but wasted 15minutes filling in before we went onto the Cambodian Visa issue. Form number 2 another 30minutes filling in and waiting for our passports to be handed back. OK were done we thought. No another building for form number 3 where 100s of people packed in here and took about 45minutes to hand them over and finally get stamped into Cambodia. Now for the part where we planned to ignore the offers for the free tourist shuttle bus because it takes you 15minutes out of town into a bus station where you buy your ticket to Siem Reap. I told the guy we were just going to walk over the roundabout and arrange a taxi ourselves but we were SDC11989 told this was illegal and they were scam taxis. I knew this was going to happen and was insistent we were getting a taxi. After 10minutes when we were tired of debating we were rounded on the shuttle bus. Here we bought tickets for the bus to Siem Reap which we thought was the double decker we seen waiting outside. Instead we were ushered onto the 9 seater minibus which was already full! The bus was horrible and packed but was bearable due to some nice guys from Hungary Israel and 1 from the Midlands. 3hours later we arrived in the middle of Siem Reap and got a tuk tuk to the Golden Mango Inn we had booked. Overall the journey was problem free and the Thailand side was perfect. Even the 6hour train was bearable and could sleep if you needed to. The next blog will be about our stay in Siem Reap but on first impressions the Golden Mango was exactly how we imagined and seemed like heaven. This will probably be the nicest place we stay on the trip. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 13 Displayed 13 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Carlos Brady and Rosara Pagent Brosara Living the dream..... full info Joined December 30th 2011 Trips 1 Last Login February 28th 2020 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 20 Guestbook 2 Photos 954 Forum Posts 0 blog=682368 blogger=225258 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=682368 blogger=225258 Advertisement Trips South East Aisa January 15th 2012 -» ongoing SDC11992 SDC11990 SDC11991 SDC11992 SDC11996 SDC11997 SDC11998 SDC11999 SDC12001 SDC12004 Travel Blog » Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Aranya Prathet » Blogs » Bangkok to Siem Reap Tot 3.034s Tpl 0.046s cc 11 qc 52 dbt 0.1077s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.4mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

The guide book doesnt rate here as a top backpacker destination so no tourist spots are listed never the less we did some research and found that there was a National park situated just outside of the town centre. We packed our ruck sack and took a taxi to the park. The taxis in Asia are fairly unconventional and it was more of a pick up truck we sat in the back of but it made for great viewing of the surrounding landscape on the way. As we approached the park you could start to see its beauty an area with mountains and tree covered hills looked stunning in the sunshine. We arrived and paid the admission as it was a Saturday it clearly was a popular weekend hot spot for locals and people from further a field Oliver and I did stand out like a saw thumb here being the only westerners in sight. We began with a hill top trek around the park running through it was a beautiful river where you could go and sit in to cool down or have a pic nick River in the park by. The hill top path wasnt much of a path at all more of s dusty slope with rocks and trees to negotiate around still this was some good exercise for us. We saw a variety of brides trees and other wild life while walking. We came by the river and had a little water break in the river was some big and little fish quite happy to try nibble at your feet felt strange but you can pay for that to be done in England why not do it in a National Park? After the fish had some lunch and we cooled down seriously hot walking sweating buckets we Continued our treck we came across some big rocks heading up the stream and kind of lost the path we were following after some discussion and a bit of a clamber of the rocks it was clear we had got lost with no other alternative we turned back and went the way we came. The main path leading towards the water fall was far easier to walk up in flip flops than the hilltop walk we first tried makes you wonder why we didnt do that first. Once we Nature Trail arrived at the waterfall you could see its beauty straight away nestled in the trees and rocks was beautifully clear water running down into a pool where you could go and swim or just have a cool off. How ever as we got to the side of the waterfall pool I have never seen so many shoals of fish in all my life great big black ones no idea what breed and the locals seemed to be feeding them green beans they went wild for them. I had a dip in the pool a local passed we a strand of bean and the fish swarmed me it was quite scary at first if I am honest but after I new they werent going to have bite of me I was quite happy to feed them needless to say I still didnt spend to long in there. the tranquil setting here was definitely a trip worth doing and Ollie and I were pleased we made the decision to come a very pleasant change from the sights of Pattaya or Bangkok.

We had entered the Drake. The weather was quite good so the seas were also not too bad – just a small swell. The day was largely spent viewing sea birds from out on the decks. Most of my previous knowledge on albatrosses centered around golf but by the end of those two days I knew much more and spent a lot of time on deck trying to snap photos of them. They are huge birds. Their wingspans can be up to 3.5 metres! Roughly twice my height. They like to circle and follow the boat as it churns up the little fishies in the water and also gives them some extra help with flying they can fly for hours without flapping their wings once. Speaking of which one thing I wasn’t expecting was how great the food was. You have 3 meals per day. Breakfast and Lunch were buffet style all you can eat and dinner usually 5 courses. Dessert was available for both lunch and dinner. There was usually an afternoon tea. Going hungry was not going to be a problem. I P1137189 stuffed my face with as many veggies as possible. Being a backpacker I wasn’t going to let this opportunity slip. The cruise also provided free alcohol from an extensive bar. You read that correctly. Seeing as not much was happening while crossing the Drake everyone got well acquainted with the bar. The next day late in the afternoon the first iceberg was spotted to much excitement. It was quite large and unexpected. I was a little perplexed because we didn’t see the next iceberg for a number of hours after that. I also briefly spotted a whale off the front of the ship but it was mainly just a couple of spouts of water and a small glimpse of its back before it disappeared. First land sighting was around 830pm and this caused more excitement. That was short lived as the weather turned for the worse and the seas became very rough with the swell reaching around 3-4 metres. A lot of people stayed away from the bar that night. The next day were made our first landing at Half Moon Bay. In order to get to and from the island we made use of Zodiac boats. If P1137375 you’ve never been in one before they look like a rubber dingy but they are very versatile. They are the most popular vessel in the world and also used by military/police forces. The process of getting 110 people from the ship to land only took around 40 minutes which we reduced as we got more familiar with the process. We were in the South Shetland Islands which is part of Antarctica but not the actual mainland. Here we would be introduced to a big Chinstrap Penguin colony. By the end of the trip I knew most of the different penguin species. The most overpowering smell emanated from this island - Guano. Or penguin shit as its otherwise known. The rocks around their nests were covered in the stuff – mostly dark red. The way they just lifted their tails and let fly in projectile fashion no matter where they stood was quite funny. And interesting. I would be tempted to remove the word ‘pig’ from that very common saying and replace it with ‘penguin’. You’d see them covered head to toe in the stuff – big red patches on their white bellies. Considering how often they fell over I P1137365 was not surprised. Some of the penguins were nursing young chicks of which many were less than a day old which was pretty special. Penguins are completely fish out of water when it comes to standing upright pardon the pun. Not only are they not suited to walking they must contend with slippery and icy slopes rocks and other penguins and sometimes seals blocking their paths. Even though they always seem to be walking with a purpose they wear what I would describe as a masked grimace. When they fall over there is little grace. It is akin to a baby taking its first steps and plomping down on its backside. Though with penguins its usually face-first. But they are quite stoic and simply get back up and carry on. Maybe a little more quickly than before. I swear you can see a glimpse of embarrassment. But as soon as they get into the water it’s a complete metamorphosis. I could not believe how quickly they could move and change directions in the water. It doesn’t seem to add up. They have no flippers just some little webbed feet. And their wings aren’t terribly remarkable. But P1137500 remarkable the penguins are. Often you’d see them porpoising out of the water and darting left and right. I’ll never well try not to laugh at another penguin falling over again. Much respect little fellas. The next stop was another island – Deception island. Nobody knows the true origin of the name but there are a few theories. And believe it or not way out here there is quite a bit of history to the place. The island was formed after a volcano magma chamber collapsed. You can still see steam emanating from the thermally heated water which gives the place a fantastic eery vibe. The island was used as a Whaling station by the Norwegians in the early 1900’s but they had to abandon the place after they harvested every whale in sight. By the end of the 30’s they had to travel more than 200km’s just to find a whale. A bit sad to be honest. In 1941 British Commandoes went to Deception island to suss out if there was any German activity in the area. They then sabotaged the old Norwegian storage tanks used for fuel and whale oil so the German’s or their allies P1126938 could not use the place as a staging base. It’s surprising to see that some of the old wooden buildings are still standing though just barely. The next day we explored Cuverville island though we took the Zodiac’s on a detour around some huge icebergs and spotted a Leopard seal camped out on a sheet of ice. The seal was taking an opportunity to rest because they were in the stages of moulting which not only involves moulting their fur but also their skin! Ergh. We were informed that this process is somewhat painful. You reckon?! We also spotted a Weddell seal who inquisitively approached the Zodiac. It was fun watching him for a few minutes before we landed on Cuverville. Here we saw Gentoo penguin colonies – again with young chicks and some unhatched eggs. We also watched in despair as a Skua angry seabird circled one particular colony and snatched away a young penguin chick then proceeded to rip it to shreds in front of our very eyes. You just have to keep telling yourself that it’s all part of nature and secretly wish bad thoughts on the dirty Skua. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 14 Displayed 14 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Matt Feld webz Joined June 17th 2011 Trips 0 Last Login May 30th 2018 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 28 Guestbook 23 Photos 506 Forum Posts 0 blog=772618 blogger=202070 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=772618 blogger=202070 Advertisement Brief history of Antarctica Speculation over the existence of a southern land was not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas sou...more history P1126953 P1127035 P1137129 P1137198 P1137230 P1137301 P1137315 P1137412 23rd February 2013 G Kriesfeld non-member comment Your trip so far This is an incredible part of your journey around the globe!

Woot! It was really great. I made two bowls both of which i think will turn out okay...hopefully.... i love clay. its squishy and cool and just plain neat. In a couple days ill go back and glaze them both and then theyll be fired. I dont know much about pottery so if im missing somehting im hoping my sensei will knock me over the head....hopefully Ill be able to come home with authentic Japanese bowls. Very cool. they will be pieces of art just you wait...*she says as they crumble and fall apart* Today the two girls and i went to English class and were taught the proper way to speak english. We english speakers dont know anything. Its a very complicated i dont know how anyone stands learning it in the first place. The text book that they gave us to use as a reference has sooooo many mistakes in it. No wonder people have a hard time learning english. Theyre using the wrong texts! After english class which i failed because i dont know any phonetics we went to another class where were suppose to teach english nursery rhythms. All of us girls made total fools out of ourselves. lots of fun 😉 And THEN after that i went to a Japanese sewing class which isnt any different than the sewing classes ive taken before except everyone speaks Japanese...lots of miming was involved. Its going to be great. Im making my own dress and if i finish it on time i might be able to show it off in the fashion in November. Ill be the only がいじん gaijin - foreigner on the runway. On my way home today it took the wrong train. Fun times. I took the SUPER Express rather than just the normal express. I ended up somewhere called Chiyro or something. Luckily some of the signs are in english so i was able to wrangle my way to the right platform. Unfortunately just because youre on the right platform doesnt mean that youre going to be on the right train which was my problem in the first place. I did a lot of pointing and tilting of the head before i was confident that i was going the right way. So because of all this i get home late which is no peoblem except that my host sister and i were suppose to pick up the cell phone im buyng that evening. We arrive at the store on time and everything except that we find out we need my host mother there to authorize something or other and we dont have time to go home and back again. So Im STILL without a cell. *sigh* tomorrow. *crosses fingers* So yeah thats it for today.....toodles 😉 Em « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Emily Mathews Emble bee I am currently an undergrad student in British Columbia Canada.

Until 1802 Torrevieja existed only as an ancient guard tower which gave the town its name Torre Vieja Spanish means Old Tower and some labourers cottages. The town is known for its salt production. Although by the dawn of the 20th century a quarter of all the salt harvested from the lagoon in Torrevieja was sold in Spain itself and the rest exported was to foreign markets. Today it is still an important industry in Torrevieja and a major employer. There is a Museum of Sea and Salt. The population is approx 50% spanish approx 25 % other european. We stayed one night at the harbour and walked the quiet streets in the evening not much happening in mid november. The town looked like all the elderly in Europe was living here for the winter. Pilar de la Horadada is a town and district in the Province of Alicante in the southeast of Spain. Located 66 km south of Alicante the city is the southernmost of the Valencian Community only 1 km north of the regional border. The town is the southernmost town Torrevieja.... of the Alicante provins. In Pilar de Horadada there have been built two huge tourist villages between the main road and the sea. Both was almost completely empty Mil Palmeras and Torredo del Horadada. The closed restaurants had signs saying they were opening on 2 of april 2014. We found the peace and and took the week as a holiday. On the 16 of november we woke up to +7 C and a strong northern cold wind. We packed and headed north again to the protective mountains north of Alfaz del Pi Albir and Benidorm. On the mountain tops we could see snow in Madrid the same night the temperature was down to 0C. The temperature riced quicky to +23C and we could calm down. The cold wind we experienced in the south of Torrevieja was diverted away by the high mountains and we continued enjoying warm weather. However our plan is to go further south and we had a fantastic day and evening with good friends in Torrevieja. Actually we are getting better and better on 8 hours + lunches. Nothing can beat a good conversation with friend you havent seen for many years. The Benidorm week ended in Cartagena. We enjoyed a nice sightseeing with in the Roman theater Museum in Cartagena. In the harbour we met other Norwegians in their sailboat. A one year trip from Trondheim to the med and back. I guess they are going to extend their tour. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 25 Displayed 23 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message Advenus Advenus We set up a plan in summer 2012.

Yesterday - Montserrat an abbey up amongst some remarkable rocky protruberances - I cunningly bought a multi-ticket which let me onto the train a cable car and funicular thus making up for Wednesdays funicular disappointment. - The cable car was ace. - I ate horrible food in a horrible big buffet and there were loads of old ladies with red labels on their lapels who also ate the horrible food. I had a magnum even though it was cool up in those mountains - the magnum intake on this trip has been steady. - Rocky Outcrops are now superceded by these fantastic protruberances. I climbed up a few having taken the Funicular up to the nearly top. The sun came out and I played my ukulele overlooking a valley. All rather nice. - Went back down to the horrible big buffet for a well earned beer had scaled slim steep steps and clambered hither and thither all afternoon therefore beer was much deserved. - Last night I had a couple of glasses of wine and some more potatoes in a Cable car coming the other way tapas bar and played my ukulele so as to disrupt the snogging couple nearby. They didnt seem to notice. Meanwhile nearby a Dutchman had his camera stolen. - Today it pissed down with rain in the morning. By lunch the sun was out. Meanwhile Id hit the Funicular up to Montjuic with the aim of escaping the rain and slipping into to the Joan Miro Foundation gallery I havent done any culture yet. Unfortunately 14000 other people had had the same idea and there was a queue going down the road for miles. I legged it to the top of the hill to get away from the queue and also because I like being at the top of hills. - I saw the cable car and having thoroughly enjoyed yesterdays cable car I thought Id take a ride. I even got a car all to myself. Wish Id brought my uke - would have made an excellent youtube video. Oh well. - I thought the cable car would take me all the way to the port. But in fact thats a whole different cable car and they dont link up. Shame. - Had an omlette Montserrat in the touristic but pleasantly sunny Reial square. Walked from there to the port and all the way up to the big glass building with the W on it at the end of the harbour. It was ace - lots of ominous clouds nice photo opportunities to boot. I even found 3 stones. - Walked back into town past the Picasso Museum also huge queue including an ambulance though I dont think it was queueing just resuscitating fallen queuers. I just made a short cut straight into the gallery shop avoiding entirely the tiresome looking at pictures bit and bought some nice postcards which I can look at in my own good time. Im now awaiting my clubclass night train ride home. Havent even started on my whisky yet so Ive got that all to look forward to. Perhaps Ill have some patatas bravas on the way to the station.

Around Dizengoff Square with its drum-shaped fountain are a number of fine Bauhaus buildings. Characteristic long horizontal lines formed by smooth balconies and ribbons of windows skinny verticals including the classic thermometer” windows of internal stair ways gentle curves and occasional sinuous forms abound. There is over 1000 of these remarkable buildings remaining from the Modern Movement of the 1920s and early 1930s. They were built by European immigrants schooled in the International style and adapted for a hotter climate. They display an elegant simplicity and functionality of style. The majority are built from smoothly rendered white washed concrete and possibly result of the poverty of materials” experienced by this city during its early development. The most notable are located around Rothschild Boulevard and Ahad Ha’am Street which is experiencing ever-ongoing restoration. It is these buildings that ensured Tel Aviv were granted a UNESCO World Heritage protection in 2003 as the White City” on the Med. The most impressive buildings include Kiriyaty House on Ruppin Street Krieger House on Rothschild Boulevard Dunkelblum House the cubic structure of Shomon IMG_07821 Yafe on Bialik Street and our own hotel the former Esther cinema. The cinema was designed in 1930 and is now crammed full of cinema themed paraphernalia and styling. In addition there is also an array of highly uncompromising buildings in the brutalist style. Not much loved but still giving a coherent and exacting impression and adding much to the city heritage. Just as you are getting comfortable with the incredible architectural legacy of Tel Aviv there are a couple of absolute howlers that jar you from your comfort zone. Number 2 Trumpeldor Street is the black sheep of the family. The building is situated on the promenade and is a cacophony of ill-fitting forms and disjointed lines crammed tightly together without proportion or symmetry. In a weird way it resembles a solidified version on the 1970s children’s game mousetrap”. The building is a mash of struts braces odd projections and even what appears to be a bucket affixed to one side. This Frankenbuilding must be some kind of career breakdown writ large in concrete. If painted in monochrome the buildings sharp pointed forms and harsh oblique lines would make it look like part of the film IMG_07771 set of the German expressionist movie The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Even in on paper this could not have looked like a particularly good idea. The blue prints may well have come back with a parental guidance warning. Further along the coast is further montrosity a bride of frankenbuilding if you will. This construction has a strange irregular facade. 181 Hayarkon Street was designed by the French architect Leon Gaignebet and constructed in 1985. Supposedly the vision was to create a building that brought together the sea and desert. The sea is represented on the white side by the balconies that resemble waves and the desert on the beige side is full of plants and sand sculptures. The unfortunate result is is the balconies look as they have been unnaturally grafted onto an otherwise bland dun coloured building which has been subjected to outbreaks of occasional unpleasant random growths. It looked like someone scribbled over the top of the original blue print but the building was constructed regardless doodles and all. Across the road a matching bench had been placed . It is a explosion of grey piping. It must rank as the most uncomfortable pieces of street furniture ever produced. These aberrations of form do provide a funcounter point to the TLV building stock. After a morning of touring the Bauhaus stylings taking in clean and attractive lines they are a resounding poke in the eye to a fan of seamless lines and harmony of form. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message liverpool1023 liverpool1023 A reluctant business traveller and accidental tourist these are some of my musings on the nature of travel.

This morning I met Matt a doctor of geology or Rock Doc if you will before heading out to my favorite road cut in Khor Fakkan. I was looking forward to this because I love site visits and rocks and I was looking forward to learning about geology in general from a former geology professor. I hadnt been this heavily involved in Geology since college and I miss it. It is starting to come back to me but it will definitely take lots of practice and research. fortunately dork that I am I enjoy reading about geology. We actually missed our freeway exit and since this is the UAE there was no place to easily turn around so by the time we found the next exit we decided to take the scenic route - back roads. It was pretty cool no camels but there were lots of goats crossing our way and a bunch of tiny little towns. We arrived at the engineering trailer onsite and as always he invites us sit down and chat with him - he is very friendly and I think he enjoys the company. He gave me turkish coffee which is my second time inside Al Meshwar restaurant - and I wound up having two more during the day. I never drink coffee but I like it! We discussed the road cut and went out with a couple of other engineers to discuss safety measures for potential falling rocks in the problem areas. We returned to the trailer chatted more than Matt and I headed back to the newest cut for photos. Being the hardcore professional geologist that he is of course we hiked up and down and across the cuts in 100+ degree heat. I havent sweated this much since soccer last week! Did I talk about the soccer game??? Tomorrows blog!. It was pretty neat though. Matt was seemed to be having a great time performing experiments by tossing rocks down the cut and seeing if and where they landed in the road. A few did but would have been diverted with a k-rail so thats good. In the meantime our favorite engineer had ordered us lunch and after about two hours of this hike we returned to the trailer around 3pm hot sweaty dirty and bright red yes I wore sunblock - always have always will. I like my white skin. He had ordered a rare photo of ME in front of Al Meshwar restaurant us lamb kebabs and I dont know if it was because I was famished or they just were that good but they were YUM. Tender juicy seasoned and grilled to perfection. Between this meal and the brunch I have set aside my prejudices and decided lamb is good. After lunch we returned to the second cut which is higher and steeper. I didnt think we were going up so I was just holding my camera in my hand and it got a little dusty I feverishly cleaned it later!!!. But up we went. To the top. The benches in this cut were not nearly as wide and were full of gravels making it a little more treacherous Fugroians and Dad - please ignore!. We didnt purposely toss rocks over the side as there were workers at this time but there were a few little rock falls. Fortunately the benches work and none landed on the streets. Yay! Matt is only in town for two days so he wants to get a lot accomplished during that time. I knew today was going to be long but I was soooo ready to get to our hotel. We made a pass typical Emirati homes by a resort hotel nearby that were also drilling but our tiny little car would never make it up the off roading adventure trails see August 7th blog. Then we tried to get to a beach area for some geology question he was curious about but we couldnt get through a highly secure area. Eventually we headed to our hotel in Fujairah. Oh my god the hotel is AMAZING. Nour Arjaan by Rotana - highly highly recommend it especially for long term stays. I have my own little kitchen staff is very friendly and my bed is so comfy! We headed out for dinner after MUCH MUCH needed showers and wound up at this place called Al Meshwar Restaurant and Cafeteria. Very nice pretty fancy but I liked it. The downstairs is a cafe where they sell desserts and small ala carte items along with sheesha lounging. Upstairs is the restaurant with a pleasant little water fountain in the middle. Food was good and decently priced but not very vegetarian friendly. After the lamb today I was looking for something light - the best I could find was steak with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes - not kidding. It Matts rental Sparky! was pretty good though. Now I am back in my cozy little bed watching CSI and telling you good night! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 23 Displayed 23 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 23 Message Alexis M Spencer lexispence10 I was an engineer on a long term assignment first in Dubai and then in Qatar.

I do its really refreshing and up-lifting. Sometimes I have days where I feel alone and really miss everyone back home but Ive found that a good dance session really makes me see clearly...I mean I have a dream travel the world and to start this travel off with living in Japan for a time and here I am living my dream dancing uncontrollably for some reason always puts this into perspective for me. So I know its been forever and a day since I last updated my blog...what can I say apart from Ive been busy...living. My 6 month anniversary of being an Aeon teacher is believe it or not next week and its just turned into October...why does the time go so fast when youre overseas and nowhere near as fast at home? Japan is still living up to my very high expectations and managing to surprise me with new experiences and interesting stories all the time...god I love this country. I would be a lot happier if it actually started to cool down and become the Harajuku shopping street season that it is supposed to be they call this Autumn??? It still feels like the middle of summer some days...please some reprieve from the stickyness...thats all I ask. I know Ill probably be asking for the sun as soon as it gets cold...thats the way life goes though huh? Ive taken a few trips in the last few months my first one was to Tokyo with Lauren and Kyle. We only went for the weekend but its nice just to get away even if its just a couple of days. One of the highlights was heading to Harajuku where all the young people dress crazily although I have seen it before it always changes and being amused by this middle aged man dancing and singing all by himself to Superstition- hilarious at least I do it in the privacy of my apartment!!. In August I met up with Bianca and Richard in Kyoto for a day and did some sightseeing Kyoto always amazes me cos no matter how many times I go there this was my 3rd there are always more things to see and do- in fact Im heading there again next weekend with some students Kels and I Kegon Falls and co-workers for another day. It has to be one of my favourite cities in Japan. A week later my little sis came to visit for my summer holidays it was so great to have Kelsey here. We spent some time in Osaka and Nagoya with Bianca and Richard before they flew back home and then went travelling for a week. Its amazing how close you can become with a little sister who you used to fight so much with...my Mum always said You just wait as soon as you two dont live together anymore youll be great friends and miss each others company I thought this was ridiculous of course and always replied Are you serious? I hate her. But as I have found out on a number of occassions over the last few years Mums do usually know best. We had so much fun together and not once were we at a loss of things to talk about or laugh about. We headed to Nikko for a couple of days first and went and saw the temples and shrines around the area and also Chuzenji lake and Kegon Falls some of the natural sights. It really is Soooo excited! a gorgeous place I have no idea why its taken me so long to get there but Im glad I finally did. We also went to Tokyo for a few days...possibly the hottest and most uncomfortable Ive been in my entire life seriously!!! Now I understand why the locals head out of the city in the summer! As Kelsey said just walking down the street was like walking through a hot bath...hot and sweaty yuck! Nevertheless we still managed to have a fantastic time. We did an obscene amount of shopping but we also managed to get to Disneyland one day which was UNREAL!! Packed with people like you wouldnt believe and an unforgiving sun the whole day long but still an unbelievable experience. You see for me going to Disneyland was like a dream...living in Australia there is no Disneyland so for someone to make it to one they had to go on an overseas holiday and hence have enough money for a family trip like that. I always envied the kids who went...and literally dreamed about it. When Kelsey suggested we go I was like what...we can just decide the day before and go? Just like Surfin Mt Fuji that? We met up with Lauren and her sister who was visiting in Tokyo too and had a very drunk but great girls night out in Roppongi a district of Tokyo. How I wish there were bars like that in Nagoya!! It was wierd to take my little sister out drinking I cant believe shes 18!!! My next trip has to be the most memorable of all!! I climbed Mt Fuji!!!!! It was sort of a last minute thing one of my students decided to get a group of people together to climb as the end of the climbing season was fast approaching and so a couple of weeks later it was all organized and we were heading to the tallest mountain in Japan to scale its heights. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had...and I was worried cos Id heard horror stories about people getting really bad altitude sickness or just not thinking it was worth it and of course I hadnt gotten my body ready for a climb like that at all!! But I surprised myself believe me it was tough especially the last couple of stations when you had to push The start of the climb your body and mind forward with every step...but I did it! I now understand the expression I felt like I was on top of the world the adrenaline running through me at the top was unbelievable. We decided to climb during the day as we had to make the drive from Nagoya which was a couple of hours so we knew we wouldnt make it for a night climb to see the sunrise from the top. We left Nagoya at midnight and started climbing at sunrise and 8 hours later we reached the top...mind you we did stop and rest at all the stations for a while. It also meant that the sky was a brialliant blue when we reached the summit. So yeah I strongly recommend it if anyone ever wants to do it. The only other small trip I took was to Takayama with Lauren and her student Kazue...its a couple of hours away but a beautiful place. Very old-style traditional Japan. We went to a folk style village and also a museum where they put these big floats on display that they use for a big festival they have in Takayama. A great day out. Lauren and I Takayama Teaching is becoming more natural for me Im still having a great time and really enjoy my classes. I got a new foreign teacher co-worker Doug. Hes pretty cool luckily we have a great friendship so work really is just a whole lot of fun and laughter. Of course its still work so there are days when I dont want to go or just dont have the energy to dance and prance around the classroom with my very energetic 6 year old boys but at least Im not sitting at a desk all day looking at a computer screen. Actually one of the best things about my job is that every day is different. Always teaching but never the same topics and believe me the students are always coming up with different things to talk about. The relationships that Ive got so far out of this job has to be the highlight...socialising with my co-workers and students is great! From climbing Mt Fuji trips to Kyoto going to see a sumo match traditional concerts in the grounds of Nishio castle taking a tour of the Toyota factory to going out drinking its all so much fun. Especially those nights when Out with students all you plan to do is go have dinner and it ends up being so much fun you miss the last train home and spend the night sleeping over at a students house talking til 6am and then getting up a few hours later to go home. Anyway thats all for now...I have to go...I feel the urge to dance uncontrollably to very loud music!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 22 Displayed 22 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Lanz Lanz I moved around a lot when I was growing up and my guess is that this is at least one of the reasons why I love to travel and always seem to be dreaming about it.

It was a very challenging climb but they had lots of fun! After their hike Shaun had a shower in our AirBnB and we left for the Gold Coast. We had planned to have dinner with Ria a lovely retired woman one of our first hosts in Australia with whom we stayed for almost a month when we arrived! We stayed in a different AirBnB and Shaun was very annoyed at our host who was very racist and just kept making inappropriate comments. We left to have dinner with Ria and her daughter Cassie who was 8 months pregnant! We had a very nice time together. Day 10 Gold Coast/Coffs Harbour 320kms On the next day we drove to Coffs Harbour. We left the state of Queensland for New South Wales driving past Newcastle and suburbs named after Welsh cities such as Cardiff. On our drive a stone flew to our windscreen creating an impact and later on a big crack. Luckily we had paid to have our excess reduced to zero so we didn’t pay anything. Blue Mountains We had a fish and chips and nice little walk on Coffs Harbour - and even a lovely ice cream afterwards! Then we drove to our accommodation we stayed in a self-sufficiency farm! That was an interesting experience! Everything is recycled and I think that apart from gas used for the stove and the oven the house was indeed self-sufficient thanks to rainwater and solar panels. The disgusting part of course was the toilet which was basically two holes I’m sure you can guess what they were for and the up keeping/cleaning wasn’t done properly because it stunk terribly the whole time. We cooked a meal exclusively with the produce from the farm an omelet with duck and chicken eggs and all the vegetables from the garden. Shaun went to buy some food he needs his bacon! at the closest supermarket - which wasn’t so close while I walked in the garden with our host Christina and she explained me lots about her farm. The cute thing was the pets there were three cats and two dogs so both Shaun and I were happy! Shaun spent time playing with the dog who was a mixed breed and had some dingo Walk on Rodriguez Pass Blackheath blood! and I spent time cuddling with the cats. One of the cats actually slept on our bed which turned out to be a mistake as it probably had ticks and Shaun ended up with a tick in his neck. Taking it off of him at 4am when he realized was not a nice experience! Day 11 Coffs Harbour/Blue Mountains 530kms After our night at the farm we drank a quick coffee and went on our way to the Blue Mountains! It was a long drive and the traffic was bad and we didn’t arrive until the evening. We met with Douwe and the three of us stayed in a YHA hostel in Katoomba. After making dinner we went for a walk to see sunset at the lookout in town. We were a bit late as the sun had already started to set but the view of the Three Sisters three big rock formations and the Blue Mountains was beautiful. We had an early night. On the next day the guys had decided to do a hike that was deemed dangerous by some of the hostel staff and I decided not to do it. Shaun realized that night that Sun setting on the Three Sisters we were supposed to give the car back the next morning... it wasn’t a problem as the rental company had said we could keep it for longer but still it reflects badly on our ability to follow the days of the calendar! Day 12 Blue Mountains After giving the rental company a call Douwe and Shaun left around 9.30 and stopped next door at the police station to grab a police beacon as advised by the hostel staff. They then drove to Blackheath and started their walk from Evans lookout around the canyon via Rodriquez pass. I was a bit worried because of what the hostel staff told us but when they came back at around 5pm they said the hike was easy not dangerous at all and that there was no way they could have gotten lost. It had been a long hike though as they had walked for more than 20kms through the forest. They were exhausted but they had fun! After they had a well deserved shower we went to a little bar restaurant called Station to get some nice pizzas. The restaurant was very busy and loud but the pizzas were nice. Day 13 Blue Mountains/Sydney 70kms The next morning Shaun and I left early to see a nice lookout in Blackheath before starting our drive to Sydney. We had to give our car back at 10am and we arrived just on time! After sorting out the car and filling an accident report for the windscreen we walked to our hostel. We stayed in a YHA again. We went for a walk in Darling Harbour and had lunch in the Eating World food court in Chinatown. When we came back to the hostel Douwe had arrived. I felt a bit under the weather so I had a nap while the guys walked around Sydney and Shaun asked for bus passes in New Zealand. Douwe Shaun and I had dinner at the hostel Shaun and I had leftovers from our lunch in Chinatown and went for an evening stroll to see a lookout point on the famous Opera House. It was a longer walk than expected but the view on the city and the Opera House was worth it! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Voyage-of-a-lifetime voyageofalifetime Who are we? / Qui sommes-nous?

Abashiri – Monbetsu 77 miles At the base of Mt. Tento just a short distance from my camping ground next to Lake Abashiri lays the repositioned Abashiri Prison. When I heard the story of Abashiri prison and the abstract and harsh misery endured by its prisoners I felt compelled to pay a visit. The curiosity derived from the suffering of others a strange one but if anything a valuable history lesson. In the late 19th century fear of the Russian Empire’s expansion further east led the Meiji government to stake a claim upon the wilds of Hokkaido. Prior to the intervention of the ruling party the north of Hokkaido was just as wild as that of Siberia a small conclave of fishing villages cut off from the world by an ocean of forest. However Abashiri’s northerly locale was deemed ideal to open up Hokkaido but to truly constitute this a road would need to be established into central Hokkaido. But how would this be achieved on an extremely limited budget? Hmm…how about some free and expendable labour in the form of one thousand prisoners? <em style=background transparent Abashiri Prison border 0px margin 0px padding 0px vertical-align baseline>Yeah that’ll do the trick! And so from all the far reaching corners of Japan a bunch of bad-arses were thus summoned to Abashiri. Firstly they would build themselves some accommodation i.e. a prison and then after that the real backbreaker a really big f*ck off road into the heart of Hokkaido. Land had to be cleared and bridges built come rain or snow it was here that the iron ball clad prisoners were really put to the test. Exploited to the point of exhaustion and starvation many died to aid the governments advance upon Hokkaido in order to claim the nation’s right to the land. Overnight the wind had become limp it was now a warm and overcast Sunday morning as I entered the grounds of the prison museum. All was quiet the weekend day trippers obviously having better places to be. Many materials from the old prison which were once located on the northern shore had been used in the replication of the museum everything exacted as it once was. From the main gate to the prisoner’s mess hall bathhouse prayer room and solitude huts. A guard tower sat adjacent harsh times the wooden radial five wing prison chamber the prisons showpiece. Here one can walk down each aisle and look into the lives of each cell. Many cells containing a puppet depicting a typical day of an Abashiri prisoner. To be holed up here through the winter months would’ve been a freezing cold hell. The prison was also a working farm so when the prisoners weren’t building a better future for Hokkaido’s infrastructure they were self-sufficient in growing their own produce. In the mess hall one could purchase themselves a prison dinner. Yet something told me that as a tourist one gets a slightly fuller plate than that of a rapist. Speaking of rape just exactly how terrible the convicts of Abashiri actually were is still to this day open to some debate. Some say that the prisoners were mere petty thieves others political prisoners sent to the wilds of Hokkaido to be silenced by the all powerful Meiji government whilst others stipulate that the prisoners were just bad really really bad. But whichever their sinning murder poetry or activism one can’t help but marvel at what these prisoners actually achieved during their miserable time at the prison. A prison that Abashiri Prison Entrance quietly came to a close in 1984 yet will forever be rooted deep in the history of Abashiri thanks to this very informative museum. In central Abashiri I made a quick pit stop at Mister Donuts for a compulsory gluten treat before then continuing in a north westerly fashion for some 20 miles along a designated cycle path to Tokoro. Just beyond Tokoro I would pass alongside the coastal Saroma Lake with a surface area of 58 mi² it sits as Hokkaido’s largest and Japan’s third largest lake. It was a dull coloured and brackish lake its appearance clearly echoed by the dreary gloom that had begun to etch the bright morning skies out of the climatic equation. As I traipsed further minding my own business as was the norm I would again be halted by one of the few things that really annoyed me about Japan traffic lights. In Kitami they would ridicule me but out in the sticks they were just plain taking the piss. They’re bloody everywhere and with Japan being the 10th most populous nation on earth they are of course in most circumstances a sensible solution to an obvious abundance of heavily trafficked roads. hard graft But in the countryside they just sit as non-sensical eye-sores and are generally completely irrelevant to their locale that and they don’t have sensors on them they are simply on timers. So you could be the first vehicle going down a certain country road for the first time since 1963 and below and behold you can bet your longest strand of ball hair that you’ll run head on into a red light. But then one has to remember where one was in Japan this mental test of patience was surely considered a great incentive to discipline one’s self. And if you can’t wait a couple of minutes at a completely irrelevant to humanity traffic light then you’re more than likely to fail the Japanese code of etiquette as a Japanese or you’re just not Japanese. Taking a quick look around and observing a plenitude of nothing and a couple of ominous looking bushes I shrugged my shoulders and broke the code. A code I would come to break on countless further occasions. Often upon doing so I would take a look around and offer a ‘What’s the fecking point in these fecking traffic lights?’ gesture in order to buy my naughty corner law breaking self some form of credibility. But generally I‘d be alone and thus no one really cared for my pet hate for the countries overly numerous traffic lights. Which is a shame because I really hate them and I just wanted everyone to know that. But now as a reader I guess you do. My evening saw me arrive in the port town of Monbetsu a place that often crops up in my mind when I cast my mind back to my time in Japan. And for no particularly right or wrong reason apart from it generally being a bit of a s*ithole. But saying that I’ve most definitely been to bigger s*itholes like Invercargill. As expected of a port town though it was invariably shabby even for Japanese standards. Along the docks cardboard and plastic wrapping blew about like tumbleweed as noisy forklift trucks darted about with pallets of scrap metal. If this were any other country apart from Japan one would expect to see a few burnt out Ford Escorts down by the shore front. The town like many on the shores of Hokkaido is a trading post with Russia. In just a short time of Abashiri Prison being there I’d already witnessed a few conspicuously tall caucasian chaps mooching about with plastic bags full of rattling Vodka bottles. The town even had a number of signs about in cyrillic. I’d have to be on my guard tonight for I hadn’t made it this far north to get bummed in my tent by a bunch of rowdy Russian’s. found an Aeon Mall of which usually has a roof top car park from there one can gain a good vantage point in order to try and get a grasp of the lay of the land and even potentially figure out a suburban green space i.e. a park for a night’s stealth camp. My immediate surrounds being particularly built up yet casting an eye away from the mall saw a procession of grubby and lost looking apartment blocks fizzle out a third of the way up a distant hill from there vegetation was allowed to reign supreme. It was there that I would find my pitch. Upon coming to this conclusion I took a glance downwards toward the mall’s ground floor car park. A couple of bulky white men were looking up at me with a curious eye my working the land - Abashiri Prison butthole clenched a little as I took a step back out of their line of sight. Waiting a few seconds I would then for no good reason approach to have another look they were still looking at me. I quickly jumped back again equally and as unnecessarily alarmed as before I appeared to be playing subconscious mind games with Russians for reasons unknown. Should I take another peak to see if they are still looking up me? I thought. What again? Why? I don’t know. Just leave it you f*cking idiot. Yeah ok good call. Who are you talking to? You! Me? <em style=background transparent border 0px margin 0px padding 0px vertical-align THE CLAW....of Monbetsu baseline>Yes you! But I am you. No you’re not. Yes I am. Oh ok bye! Ok see ya mate good luck not getting bummed. Thankfully talking myself out of a third glance I hastily retreated from the mall and cycled up into the hills. It would be dark by the time I’d made it through the suburbs and on to the hills sweaty ascent. Just beyond the last batch of architectural atrocities I would find a park. The bitumen evacuating and presenting me with a constricted and steep gravel infested slope. From there I would have to get off to push my bike to the hills summit. The surrounding park unlike the rest of Monbetsu was meticulously well maintained to camp here now felt a trifle insulting. But thinking of the Vodka swilling Russians in the town centre below and how at some Monbetsu point during the night they would probably end up pissing through some poor old Japanese Gran’s letterbox made me feel like the idea of camping on an immaculate Wimbledon Tennis Club esque lawn was probably the least of Monbetsu’s concerns….probably. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tokyo to Tokyo - A Cycling Adventure around Japan OUT NOW « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 11 Displayed 11 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 6 Message Daniel Doughty dsd_uk In 2014 I cycled from Tokyo to Tokyo In 2015 I started writing a book about cycling from Tokyo to Tokyo In 2016 I finished writing a book about cycling from Tokyo to Tokyo In 2017 I will not be cycling from Tokyo to Tokyo. http//tokyo-to-tokyo.com/ ... full info Joined January 14th 2007 Trips 0 Last Login October 24th 2018 Followers 6 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 112 Guestbook 75 Photos 1204 Forum Posts 29 blog=949890 blogger=30139 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=949890 blogger=30139 Advertisement Brief history of Japan In 1603 a Tokugawa shogunate military dictatorship ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power.

The journey is not quite over for Kornies5. We have decided to set up a more permanent sort of camp in Bellingen NSW and have leased a house for a year. We have had a wonderful few months here the kids love their time at Chrysalis Steiner School. It is quite a magical place set on the edge of a hill in a forest near Thora. The view from the classroom includes waterfalls mountains rivers…not a building anywhere to be seen. When I was visiting Sam’s class he introduced me to Snaky” a friendly tree snake that they have adopted and acknowledge each day as he rests on the top branch of his favourite tree. Jojo has begun his Montessori pre-school Adam has a job as Commercial Manager Medical Lighting at Planet Lighting and I have been doing some casual teaching…so another year in this green hot flood prone sub tropical paradise seems as if it was meant to be! That being said we will complete our circuit in December and return to Melbourne for a few weeks 23 Dec-Jan 12 to catch up with friends family and reunite Jojo with his beloved train set which will have to relocate Sams School Camp Just about time to head home ...Sam had a ball and so did his dad as a parent helper to Bellingen  It was the only way we could get Jojo to agree to stay! Sam is becoming an expert hand knitter long stitch extraordinaire and had a large speaking part in his school play last Wednesday. He loved his three day two night camp with his class especially the animal tracking and star gazing using a telescope on the beach. He won The Korny who lasted longest without a haircut” award but has recently had his curls curtailed so that he could actually see! Max is weaving his own pencil case mastering his woodworking skills and was a leading musician in his class play. I survived without Max just! for 5 days while he headed with his class to The Gibraltar Ranges hiking swimming orienteering cooking and then returning in one piece to be washed fed and put to bed for a day or so. Max seems to be attached literally and metaphorically to his guitar lately but we did hide Sams recorder after a while! Jojo has begun taking part in a gorgeous pre school and is smitten by the nana like Rineke who lives a few doors down from us. He likes to Bello Floods Creek outside our house starting to fill up!!! walk to her house to visit on his own and makes sure that I am not following secretly behind. He is showing a surprising interest in National politics. During a recent discussion about the Liberal leadership challenge I was telling Adam that I was surprised that Hockey didn’t win. After all he is of Rudd’s generation personable easy to relate to warm cute and cuddly” to which Jojo responded Just like me Mama!” If he keeps on enjoying the delights of Bellingen Gelato Bar he might be right! Our friends have helped us feel so welcome here. We enjoy Shabbat together each Friday night preparing food together and marking the end of the week with joy laughter and lots of kids running around! I have hit the garage sales filling Gull and Sacha’s storage up with beds tables couches crockery etc to furnish the home we will be letting from January. Peter Blecher you would be proud of my garage sale performance but Adam is still recovering from the regular Sunday night furniture pick ups from around town. Adam is no longer Tom Hanks from Castaway. Both Max and Sam walked right passed him when he went to The Devines are back... The gang back together again for one night only... pick them up clean shaven with short hair from the bus stop. He has returned to full time work but instead of a 45 min drive to Laverton he hops on his bike crosses the Bellinger River and is in his office within 10 minutes. I have worked with both classes six and eight at The Steiner School. Obviously the forest setting introduces new challenges that will definitely add to my teaching repertoire. While I was teaching Class six I heard a student yelp as she opened the teacher’s desk looking for a pencil. A family of baby rats had decided to make this drawer their home. The students were not perturbed and many volunteered to remove them from the drawer and I gratefully accepted their offers of help. I probably should have zipped up by bag however as one daring rat jumped out of a boy’s hand and fell straight into my handbag. One lovely boy saw my face and quickly offered to take my bag outside and deal with the rogue rat”. He emptied the entire contents of my bag onto the verandah and caught the rat…had a cuddle…then released him into the wild. This all Goodbye farewell The Caravan was sold to a family in Vic and was finally collected in a tearful farewell on the back of a truck... took place in the first hour of my first casual teaching job in Bellingen. It was amazing to see how at home these kids are in the natural world…I have so much to learn from them…but I don’t expect to be cuddling up to rats any time soon. It is so wonderful ending our around Australia adventure with another journey that has already treated us to many rich and wonderful experiences. Both in Bellingen and around Australia the best part of our year has been meeting and sharing our experiences with such wonderful people. What stands out for all of us is how incredibly generous supportive and warm people are when trekking around this country. It has helped us become a more open optimistic and giving family. I hope we all stay in touch.

What will I say if someone asks What did you think of Japan?” Im a muddle of conflicting but true-for-me opinions - Im intrigued but not besotted. I wrote this entry first while in Hong Kong immediately following our departure I am finishing it two months later at home after memories have settled and distance of both time and geography give a little more perspective. Tokyo was a nut we never did crack. In fact I have it on my ‘to return’ list but not because of the pleasure found but rather the challenge to figure out what so many others are entranced by. Or not. Anthony Bourdain who has since left this earth has it as his favourite city in the world and hes not alone. Two things I would do differently Up our hotel budget to have a room in the hub of the action and hire a guide not for the sites but for the experiences. The rest of our three weeks were quite wonderful in this most foreign of lands. The history was beyond our kin ? and that gave us exercise in trying to understand relevance of the places we visited. A lot of it went right over our heads. It also served as a foil to show how much meaning comes fitting puzzle pieces into the histories we are familiar with - European history colonization footprints and WWII for example. Rather like finally seeing the Mona Lisa vs another great work that you don’t recognize. The Japanese culture of order and discipline ekes out in every way. A dozen people will wait at a don’t-walk light despite no traffic anywhere in sight in either direction. Painted lines on train platforms guide commuters to stand to the side of train doors allowing those inside to exit freely...and that’s where people line up. In one train a sign was posted to put your phone in manners mode”. Never once did we see anyone taking a phone or video call in a public area. People speak quietly. One woman leans over the back her train seat to ask if its ok for her to recline it a bit...in sign language but a welcome thoughtfulness. No garbage cans in public areas - everyone takes their trash home with them. And no garbage or graffiti is found in public places. One Aussie teacher we met squealed with amazement at seeing a trash bin in a train station and vowed to take a picture. The topography of the country was beautiful. Mountainous and hilly the cities seemed to sit on flat valley floors. Hills were treed not housed. We both found it amazing that the high-end homes you usually find on hillsides to get the views were rare. The buildings are noticeably neutral colours. Cement bone ecru beige could all be used to described the city scapes. The roofs sometimes have enameled tiles and the rare blue ones stand out. Taxis have auto-closing doors and we’re instructed to not touch them. Got it. Bakeries are surprisingly omnipresent. Sushi less so - we may have had sushi four times throughout the trip. Expect ramen. « Previous Entry Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message J&M JandMOBrien blog=1018237 blogger=380511 Blog Map Trips 1 Print Version Travel Blog » Asia » Japan » Hiroshima » Blogs » Japan in the Rear View Mirror Tot 2.726s Tpl 0.055s cc 13 qc 32 dbt 0.1058s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 3  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

I was thinking what luck it was for me and Nicola to have met at the hostel the night before heading out on tour on good ol Oz Experience. I had a few reservations about using Oz Ex as opposed to using Greyhound but decided to go the super easy route and the little extras that you get. I was just worried about everyone being really really young! But it is nice to have accommodations and buses and a bit of sightseeing all sorted out beforehand and it is awesome that Oz Exp is now being run by Australian Adventure tours. This all means they have been revamped. In my opinion all of the new brochures seem reminiscent of the Stray Bus tours of New Zealand. So this is looking really promising! Well Ill make the most of it whatever happens otherwise it is going to be a very long nine weeks in Australia. lol Nicola and I got up bright and early as did most of our dorm it seemed because most people were taking off for various places around the country and World for that matter. So it was nice to not have to be super super quiet. I swear zippers are 1000 times louder in the dead silence of the morning and dont even think about opening/closing a velcro fastener! Oh and plastic bags... We made it to our meeting point with a bit of time to spare. We were lucky once we boarded the bus because we scored the front set of seats with the extra leg room. I felt bad for the folks in the very very back because the seats were really cramped barely any leg room plus they were lower and you couldnt see out of the windows. Our morning stop was at the Gaugin Winery in the Hunter Valley where we tried four white wines three red wines and a port. Hmm wine at half nine in the morning. this should be interesting especially for those on the bus that were already a bit hung over. 😊 I have discovered that I like white wine much more than red wine and definitely didnt like the port that we tried. It was all quite fancy considering we were a tour bus of youngish folk and Id hazard to guess not wine connoisseurs...hence not big wine buyers. As predicted my face turned a bright red...did some one turn the heater on in here? We were way ahead of schedule and had time for a short cheese tour and tasting as well. The brie and cheddar were awesome but the goat cheese was something else. We continued our drive northward for another small stretch until we got to Dungog and stopped for some lunch. Now this is a really small town. Well not so small that we doubled the population when we arrived. haha For such a small town main drag only seemed to be 3 or 4 blocks I was surprised to see two supermarkets and more than a handful of cafes. I guess they get a lot of people passing through. I wasnt all that hungry for lunch because Id been snacking all morning. Lots of breadsticks crackers cheese and a couple of Tim Tams too. I did indulge in a vanilla milkshake though while Nicola had an overpriced sandwich. Mind you it did look delish. Then it was more sitting on the bus to our accommodations in Barrington and the Barrington Tops National Park. It was on a massive piece of land. Nicola and I wandered around and saw at least a dozen kangaroo jumping about the hills. We walked towards the Koala Sanctuary in hopes of sighting a koala but it wasnt meant to be. But it could be because theyre nocturnal creatures. I was reading the koala having really small brains and therefore being really inactive and can be quite aggressive as well. For dinner we had a BBQ planned for us. Always nice to get a bit of red meat to eat and of course lots of various salads bread and a free beer. So of course I easily exchanged my beer ticket for two cokes with one of the guys. Boy are some of these kids heavy drinkers. Im not exaggerating when I say there were well over a hundred empty beer cans piled up into a tower. As predicted the bus is composed of mainly a younger crowd. Id say about half are about 19 to 21 a third in their mid-twenties and the remaining around my age. Of course as we were going round the table finding out everyones age everyone was once again astonished by my age. I jokingly said that Im dyslexic and am 23. haha I think I should really shock people one time and say that Im 39 or something outrageous like that. lol One guy was so hung over and out of it on the bus in the morning because he had a late night of drinking and not much sleep. At the wine tasting he got off the bus to go to the toilet and I swear he was going to fall down the stairs. He did a pretty good Mr. Bean impersonation though. Hes really lucky his girlfriend was around to help him out. Oh young not so smart kids these days. There was also an optional tour to go kayaking on the river at night. Hmm there are all these warning signs that the river is rocky and has fast moving waters. Now why would I want to go on this fast moving river in the dark? Plus it was really cold out and even with a wetsuit on I would have been freezing. All in all it was a full day but a fun day as well. Since most people didnt know one another it was nice to slowly get to know some of them...hard to get to know all 22 of them though! On tour on this bus there are lots of people from England and Wales and a few Canadians.

We had booked an apartment with Airbnb in the Alsatian town of Strasbourg France. We had already purchased our train tickets on the super-fast TGV train and were making last minute departure plans when we got bad news. Our reservation had been cancelled! We have rented nearly 50 apartments during our travels and it was something we expected would happen sooner or later. Because we normally rent apartments for one month it can be a little bit of a problem to find a place at the last minute. With just a few days left until we move most apartments have at least a few days rented during the upcoming month which means we are out of luck without changing apartments during the month. We travel light and moving is not a problem but to stay on budget we really need to take advantage of discounts that usually apply only when we rent for a whole month vs. just a short period. Anyway it made for some excitement as we scrambled to find something new. Strasbourg was completely Colmar Half-Timbered Houses booked in our price range. We saw a few apartments in a smaller town about an hour south of Strasbourg. We had never heard of Colmar before but the town looked cute in pictures and was located closer to the Alsace vineyard region that first interested us in Strasbourg. It would take one extra train ride but seemed like our best bet on short notice. Airbnb gave us a bit of a credit since we had been cancelled which helped us afford the couple hundred dollar price difference in the two apartments. Off to Colmar we went. It was our first opportunity to take one of the high speed European trains. The TGV makes a direct run from Brussels to Strasbourg with just a couple of stops in Lille and Paris France. Part of the ride seemed to be at normal speed but the rest was very fast. Speeding past the French countryside at about 200 miles per hour really seemed incredible. When we passed cars on the interstate the speed was especially apparent as we literally left them behind as though they were barely moving. While the speed was impressive the countryside was so gorgeous that Petite Venise Little Venice- Colmar France at times we would have liked to slow down to take in the view better. Soon enough we arrived in Strasbourg and quickly caught a local train for the last part of our journey to Colmar. We made such good time to Colmar that we actually had to hang around in the train station until our scheduled meeting time at the apartment. The taxi made its way along the cobbled road that winds its way from the station through the center part of town. The entire area is generally blocked to cars except for one winding route through the narrow buildings. We felt as if we were getting a complete tour of town as we snaked through the ancient buildings. The town has many buildings from the 15th and 16th century that have been well restored. They are of the half-timber design that is prevalent in Eastern France and Germany. They have a stone first floor and timber framed higher floors that are visually stunning. Painted pastel colors of red blue yellow pink and other colors they give an impression of walking through a childhood fairytale. Colmar is popular with French and German tourists Colmar Canals Petite Venise who arrive by car and also with older tourists who generally arrive in groups from the nearby cruise ships on the Rhine River. After just a few minutes we arrived at our quickly chosen new house. What a first impression it made. Like a storybook vision the 16th century building rises some 6 floors above a picturesque square in the center of the main tourist area. Brightly colored flowers decorated all the window boxes that hung just below the wooden shuttered windows. A bakery occupied the first floor and we were happy to only have to walk up one flight to our spacious apartment just above. Opening the windows let in the muted multi-language conversations from the square. A sweet smell of pastry came from the bakery below. A saxophone accordion or gentle guitars could be heard from a nearby corner at different times of day. It was perfect! We have spent countless hours walking around old town centers in the last 5 years and always wondered what it would be like to live in one of the restored houses that invariably populate the areas. What would it be like if every time you Colmar France Half-timbered Houses open your windows jealous tourists looked from below to admire your lifestyle? It seemed we were about to find out. We didn’t waste any time getting out exploring the town. Our favorite times were early in the morning before the tourists arrived. The narrow streets and alleys are bathed in warm sunlight that turns the early mist a brilliant golden shade as the sun rises. Church bells ring softly through the cobblestone passages which route the sound in a way that make it difficult to tell which direction it is coming from. Lights are on in the bakeries and coffee shops as early rising residents make their rounds to collect the day’s necessities. Prowling night cats make their way home in the mist after a night’s explorations. During the day tourists fill the streets and restaurants. Their excitement and wonder fill the air as they take countless photos of the fairyland visions they encounter. The restaurants fill and musicians entertain everywhere. Soon enough the crowds depart and the streets are again filled with strolling overnight guests who make their way along the beautiful canals of the Petite Venise neighborhood surely the most beautiful area Kaysersberg France of town. The streetlights romantically light the ancient houses which reflect in the slow moving canal and create a scene usually reserved for a Hollywood movie. We took advantage of the wonderful late summer products available everywhere. The wonderful Marche Couvert covered market was located just a block from our house and quickly became a favorite stop. Filled with all the goodness of the French countryside we could easily find all the ingredients available to create wonderful meals at home. Gorgeous brightly colored vegetables and gourmet cut meats were purchased daily. We made an effort to try each of the seemingly infinite assortments of to-die-for cheeses and dairy products displayed in the market. Many specialty products were found in tiny jars and containers on tightly packed shelves. When incorporated with the fresh ingredients we found we were able to create delicious meals even better than what we saw in the sidewalk cafes along the narrow streets outside. We took advantage of easy transportation to see the surrounding countryside. Visits by bus to the nearby Alsace vineyard towns of Kaysersburg Ribeauville and Riquewihr were perfect. The rolling foothills of the Vosges Mountains were covered with Colmar Maison Pfister miles of vineyards ancient castles and dreamlike towns that could not have been more magical. We strolled the tightly woven streets of the tiny walled towns which eventually led to dirt roads through endless vineyards and on to ancient ruins of medieval castles overlooking the stunning countryside. The vines were full and the rich fragrance of the nearly ripened fruit was prevalent everywhere. Colmar is located in the far eastern corner of France which means we also had access to quick trips to other nearby countries. We took a combination of buses and light rail across the Rhine into Germany to visit the bustling town of Freiburg. We found a massive cathedral in the historic center and enjoyed our walk up the nearby Schlossberg Hill to a beer garden that provided commanding views of the entire Black Forest area that surrounds Freiburg. Another day we took the train for an hour south to make our first visit to Switzerland. We enjoyed taking a slow walk through the hilly town that is split by the stunning Rhine River. The town is beautiful and obviously wealthy. The buildings and squares are stunning and well preserved. We Colmar-Petite Venise Covered Market enjoyed taking one of the tiny ferries across the river. The small boats are dwarfed by the dominant cliffs of the town that provide spectacular views over the bridges and rivers. What started as an emergency to find a place to live for a month turned out to be one of our favorite places we have visited since we began our travels. We felt lucky to have found one of the loveliest areas of France by accident. Even if we had planned our visit it could not have been better. Perhaps a lesson can be learned for our future travels. Maybe less planning and more surprise is what we need in the future. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 19 Displayed 19 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 77 Message Nanci and David Curry nancic123 In July of 2011 we made the decision to leave our comfortable jobs in Northern California to see the world.

What a great story and I adore the moral less planning and more surprise. I spent a couple of stimulating weeks in Strasbourg but my heart will forever belong in Colmar! You are so right about the fairy-tale quality of those half-timbered houses and the wonderful vineyards and nearby towns for walking and exploring. And I agree about the TGV--it goes too fast for my eyes that love to linger. You were lucky indeed--walking up only to the second floor the fragrance of a bakery beneath you and the harvest season in the French countryside. Im salivating just thinking of it! 19th October 2016 nancic123 Nanci and David Curry Lemons... We were really lucky that Colmar turned out to be so lovely. It really turned into a nice place of good food nice weather and beautiful surroundings. In other words just about perfect! I hope your travels are going well also. Thank you so much for reading and commenting Tara! 19th October 2016 Ake Och Emma Ake Dahllof and Emma Holmbro I would like it there Never heard of Colmar before but it looks and sounds like an interesting place. One of the great things about Europe is that there are so many interesting places to visit that I will never have a problem finding places worth visiting. Ake 19th October 2016 nancic123 Nanci and David Curry Colmar To be honest we had never heard of it either. Its true that Europe has so many unique places that you really could fill a life of travel here. Thanks for reading Ake! 24th October 2016 D MJ Binkley Dave and Merry Jo Binkley Hooray for cancellations Go with the flow.... good recovery. Living above a bakery sounds like heaven. I love street musicians and are glad the sounds were wafting in along with the bakery smells. Ok so Colmar is now on our list. Spontaneity can be the spice of life. Good luck. 24th October 2016 nancic123 Nanci and David Curry Hooray... Its kind of funny. I guess travel is like life sometimes things work and sometimes they dont. Weve had a couple of places that we couldnt wait to get to but never really enjoyed them and then places like this that we had never heard of but we really liked. Definitely worth stopping in the Alsace region and Colmar especially if you get nearby.

Thanks to my time in Japan I am perfectly ok with not bathing alone. It’s actually sorta lonely now. Onsen 温泉）is the name of the Japanese public baths and be for warned! They change the baths every once and a while so be sure you walk into the correct one. If you can’t read Kanji don’t fret my dears they usually have it color coded and possibly in English as well. 女 - womens　男 - mens Also sleeping on a futon is amazing!! It’s so cozy and fluffy and just enough cush but definitely bring your own pillow. Everyone looked at me funny and thought I was so weird walking through the airport and the city with pillow like a nut job dragging around a blanket or a body or something but no! Great. Idea. Makes everything more comfy because the pillows here are weird. They’re like full of beans or something not happily bean filled like a bean bag chair just hard beany shaped uncomfortable-ness. Princess and the pea style. Also and yes this is totally obvious but there are mosquitoes in Japan! SO so many mosquitoes and they are super unforgiving. They will eat you alive. Cormorant Bento My special Bento of deliciousness. Just look at the pretty colors! Granted I was in a tea garden full of greenery and lush-ness full of moisture that those little mother truckers seem to love but whatever. There was a totally random bon odori festival going on in Inuyama that we somehow found out about and even more surprisingly found where it was happening and randomly joined in. All the locals were so excited to have this literal heard of gaijin come join in on the dancing. These adorable little obaasan’s taught us all how to do the dances and I am now part of at least 6 random Japanese families bon odori pictures. gaijin 外人 - foreigner literally outside person obaasan おばあさん - literally grandmother but also used as a name for old ladies One of the bigger local attractions in Inuyama Castle which overlooks the city from atop a hill and is a National Treasure. So far I have heard them say that about every castle but maybe there is one out there that theyre just like And this one is just our ok castle. Its alright I guess. Near the entrance there is a pathway to the local shrine as well complete with iconic red Cormorant Fishing You didnt really expect me to be able to get a good picture right? gate entrance. I highly recommend the fantastic photo opportunities for example my blog photo. There is also this local attraction where you get to see traditional Cormorant fishing where fishermen use birds to fish at night by fire light. We all had fun on the dietary restrictions boat with special bento just for the weirdies like me Pepper allergy. The birds dive underwater and the fisherman will bring the bird back up to spit out the fish. It was an interesting process to see especially after we ate the fish for dinner and then got to see how I had once if fact intimately shared that fish with a bird. You wont really be able to see it in the picture but I swear there are apparently birds near the side of the boat that you just cant see in the dark or maybe they were all diving underwater to grab fish I cant really tell but they were there.

It goes all the way up the coast but i was only booked on it until Byron Bay just south of the New South Wales-Queensland border which meant three days. In addition to be transported up the coast and securing accommodation the Oz experience also organises activities for backpackers to do. On this occasion the main focus for 2 of the three days anyway was surfing. The other day was based at a retreat in Barrington a place that truly was in the middle of nowhere. Recent events had left me not in the right frame of mind by the time the tour started but by the time we reached Barrington i felt better and began to socialise more with the other people on the bus. Unfortunately many of them were extremely immature and this would prove to be something of a problem as time went on. The retreat was basically just a few log cabins in the middle of a vast expanse of hills fields and rivers. Activities available included Night Rafting exactly what it sounds like something i decided not to do but a fair few did. The food was an endless supply of Pizzas which from a taste point of view were awesome though obviously not from a health point of view. The room that i was in was a bizzare one it was the most cramped confined space i have ever stayed in it wasd a rom for six people with 2 triple decker bunk beds that barely fitted inside the room. Anyone suffering from claustrophobia would have no chance. That night one of the men who worked there took some of the party including me out for a walk to see some kangaroos we saw a fair few and this was my first ever sighting of kangaroos unless you count the meal i had a over a week ago. The next morning the bus set off from Barrington bound for Crescent head where we were to be based at a surf camp where the idea is that one learns to surf. I went out there but frankly was pretty terrible at surfing i still havnt been able to stand up and i think i will need a lot of lessons to ever reach that point. Still its something i would love to learn so maybe another time. Again the food was well tasty that evening. The mosty memorable but perhaps least pleasant event of the tour occurred later that night when one particularly immature member of the party who had clearly had way too much to drink ran amok in the dorm with some shaving cream spraying it everywhere. I was pretending to be asleep so as to avoid this crap and this guy sprayed a load of shaving cream all over my crotch you probably think i am joking but Im not I didnt say anything and just looked him in the eye. But the next day i confronted him and to be honest used a lot of bad words F@#@ etc to express my disapproval towards his actions. Though to be honest i wasnt really that bothered I dont really get angry at people I was saying these things for the sake of it. He responded with annoyance but who cares anyway. I think we all know who the mature person is here. The next day i chose not to participate in the surfing for a combination of a few reasons including the fact that i could not really do it and the bus moved its way into Byron Bay in the evening. Well then people say that the Oz Experience is similar to club 18-30 Ive never been on a club 18-30 but i reckon the people who say this are probably right « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message andrew mcgurn atm2005 test... full info blog=39465 blogger=6078 Blog Map Print Version Travel Blog » Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Barrington Tops » Blogs » An Oz experience Tot 2.616s Tpl 0.017s cc 7 qc 43 dbt 0.027s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

We booked our first hotel here to start from yesterday so we could guarantee that we would have somewhere to sleep as soon as we got there. We also told the hotel that we would be very late arriving. We have booked four nights including last night at the Landmark Grand Hotel in Deira. It looks to be very central and close to the all important Metro station. We use the Metro a lot to get around. We got to the hotel about 3.00am and they looked to be having a problem booking us in. We think they may not have read the message and thought we were not going to arrive. Eventually they said they could let us have a twin room for that night then move us to the double tomorrow. With only four nights here we were not particularly happy with that. Eventually they asked us to wait a short while and they would find us a Junior suite that we could stay in for the whole of our stay. 20190425_123801 Wow an excellent upgrade. Glad we persisted with this. While they sorted it out we visited the local supermarket and stocked up on drinks for the room and milk for the coffee in the morning. The Junior suite was everything that you could want from a hotel room and more. Very spacious and a big comfortable bed. We slept till about 10.00am then got up to unpack. We have someone arriving at 12 midday to collect our washing. Trying out a local service. It is a lot cheaper than doing it through the hotel. He turned up at 11.00am instead but thankfully it was all ready for them by then. We tidied up the room then thought we would enquire at reception how much it would be for us to have a further 6 nights staying in the Junior suite. This would save us having to make the two hotel moves that we had planned. They offered us a really good price steeply discounted by around 1000 AED so we booked it and cancelled our other original bookings. The discount was secured through our genius marker on www.booking.com. We were not looking forward to the prospect 20190425_000412 of having to pack up and move twice in any case. Nice result secured here for us. Having sorted out the hotel we had a short walk around the local area. We found the metro station and also the water taxi station. Realising we were hungry as had not eaten for about 15 hours we had a look on the entertainer app to see what offers there were locally. We found the Ashiana Indian restaurant in the nearby Sheraton Hotel and had a lovely relaxed first meal lunch in Dubai. The server gave us a BOGOF voucher for their Saturday evening buffet so we think we shall be returning here. This has to be done really. We are both still tired so headed back to the hotel for a short siesta. This evening we headed to Dubai Festival City. We had heard they had a great water and light show there. The area is not near to the metro so it was a long tedious bus ride but it was well worth it. The light and water show is to a theme and does not only cover the water area but the sides / 20190425_123703 facades of some of the local buildings too. It was a very unusual show. Dubai Festival City has one of our favourite restaurants in Dubai Shamiana so we use another entertainer voucher and have a tasty Indian meal for dinner. We were too tired to do much else whilst we are here so we got a local taxi back to the hotel and called it a night. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 21 Displayed 21 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Theresa Edwards gandt2000 We are George & Theresa.

It will be back to the normal cookies in the car on the drive to work. Couldn’t online check-in for the flight even though booked through Delta the originating flight from here is on Korean Air. I’ll need to make sure I leave for the airport a little earlier. Kind of mixed emotions right now. I’m anxious to get to the last training and give it everything I have but I’m also ready to get back to the US. although I’m not exactly excited about the length of the flying. I won’t be surprised if I sleep the entire 6 hour flight from here to Seoul. I think that flight leaves at about 10 pm. Arrival into Savannah is Saturday afternoon. Can’t wait to get back to the cool temperatures of Georgia! 94 and heat index of 105 sure felt hotter than that this morning. Got to the gym and once again it was just me and the trainers. I started the laps today looking forward to finishing the last So true.... Yeah it was hard work and at the moment I can’t even imagine training any harder. Traveling for 26 hours may affect that opinion. 11 in the Thailand heat. I was going a little slower trying to notice everything along the path. The new construction the people doing laundry on the street the taxis and scooters moving people back and forth and the smell of incense along the way. The heat was hard to ignore and the liniment burn even left after one lap. After 7 laps the sweat was splashing off me like a sprinkler. I did my best to avoid people along the way. I was talkI got to one other guy duding a lap and apparently lost count of mine because at the end Ajahn asked me if I did 12 today. Makes sense sick the Fitbit 10000 step alarm went off for the first time during the run. I immediately parked myself near the ice water and under cups of that cold water before I could face the 10 minute jumprope. Another cool down needed after jumprope and then it was into the ring. The heat was really tough today but after a shadow boxing warmup we hit the pads. I hope the video comes out well. At least the first two rounds were pretty strong. The heat started taking Jomhod after training From yesterday afternoon Jomhod was doing light training. This morning he had his weigh-in for the fight on Sunday. I believe he’s also got a Muay Thai fight scheduled for sometime in November. its toll along with Ajahns pace in the third and forth round. We did the normal punches kicks knees and multiple kicks to finish the rounds. Even Ajahn was sweating today. It was so hot they even moved a fan over near the ring first time I’d seen that. Now that I’ve made it back to the hotel and taken a nice long cool shower I need to start packing. I’ll probably head out for a light lunch and probably a last quick shopping trip I have a couple hours until I head to the airport. So another trip in the books and back to reality! « Previous Entry Additional photos below Photos 5 Displayed 5 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message pvd78256 pauld78256 Joined October 12th 2017 Trips 2 Last Login November 13th 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 28 Guestbook 13 Photos 78 Forum Posts 0 blog=1043441 blogger=376934 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1043441 blogger=376934 Advertisement Trips Bangkok #6 - Half Dozen !!!

I had qUnite a good nights sleep but was dreaming about the weight of my backpack and will it make it onto the plane! Maybe it was more of a nightmare..lol. In my dream it made it so I am hopeful! This morning after breakfast Renske and I said goodbye to Jess. Now just me and Renske left. I leave at 12.00 lunchtime for Hanoi airport. I have come out for a final iced coffee at my favourite coffee bar. I walked in circles for an hour and a half but couldnt find it! After the amount of times I have been there I am disappointed in my self. I finally gave up and came to Le Pub! ...... LOL Unbelievable..... I even got lost coming back from Le Pub to the hotel.......I think I am having a senior moment or two today! I had to get a tourist information person to do me a map! And thats after 4 weeks of doing the walk regularly!! It is 13.35 Vietnam time. I am sat in Hanoi airport. My flight leaves at 16.05 so I do have a bit of a wait. I have just spent the last of my dong on water and nibbles for the journey more peanut and sesame brittle and I finally got a pack of the crisps that Nadia has been enjoying for the last four weeks. I was soooooo happy with the check in. My dream was spot on. My bag weighed in at 18.5 kg....yayyyyyy. I was worried about that but trusted my dream! The second bonus is that she has sent my luggage through to Manchester as high priority so that I dont have to wait at the end. I am enjoying the air con as the humidity is really high today. First flight delayed by half an hour. It seemed like such a long wait in the airport. Flight only one and a half hours soon over! When I arrived in Bangkok there was a man waiting to rush us through to the connecting flight due to the delay so we were rushed straight through and more or less straight onto the flight to Abu Dhabi. It is 4am Vietnam time but only 1am Abu Dhabi time as the clocks have now gone back 3 hours! Waiting to board the final flight to Manchester. I am starting to feel it now so will probably sleep through the next flight. Mark has sent messages to confirm that he will be at Manchester so it looks like I will get home in one piece. I think i am nearly all blogged out. I am busy writing my final summary for something to do whilst waiting which will be my final blog. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Lesley-Ann Knight Lesley2912 As always.......Looking forward to another trip!

There has been a different feel to the days and we have certainly recharged the batteries. Relaxing seems to have been the key factor and we have enjoyed experiencing new parts of France. Our time in Villenueve-Lembron seemed to go all too quickly but we left with many memories and a real desire to head back there one day in the future. The southern Auvergne landscape is so different to the rest of France and the mountains and hills appear to just roll over the countryside. We enjoyed driving from one village to the next most of which meant winding your way up lanes to the top of a hill where the village sat overlooking the valley. When they built these villages in medieval times security was their key concern – I believe they got it right as no village has a direct route to it rather you travel up roads that hug the land and give you fantastic views of the plains below. We cannot thank the Recordons enough for allowing us the use of their charming home. We loved their little piece of France and enjoyed just wandering in and out of Moulins Cathedral the lanes. We read in the garden walked to the top of the hill each day wandered around the castle and church walked to Bourdes avoided all vipers shared the sunshine with the neighbours cats and generally did very little. It was bliss. We did manage to extricate ourselves from the garden to make a visit to Clermont-Ferrand. This city is about 45 minutes from Villenueve and is the closest big city. It is well known for its rugby team with Vern Cotter the coach and one Sitiveni Sivivatu playing on the wing. They are rugby mad in and around Clermont-Ferrand and I saw more rugby jerseys here than I had since La Rochelle. Driving past the city one may be mistaken that there is not much to see or do in the place in fact it has an industrial look to it from the outside. However we really enjoyed exploring and we made our way up the hill from the Place de Jaude to the imposing Gothic cathedral. This building towers over the city with its twin spires towering nearly 100m above. Built over several centuries it is constructed of black lava rock which gives it Moulins Cathedral a distinctive look and adds to its foreboding image as you drive towards the city. It must have been quite a sight for those who travelled there hundreds of years ago today it is a French National Monument and is the seat of the Archbishops of Clermont. Once inside you get the full extent of the size and space of the building – it is 100 metres in length. The stained glass windows allow just enough light but it is their illumination that is what people come to see. The colours are quite extraordinary. Narelle and I split up once inside and wandered on our own but when we met up we both felt exactly the same thing – our visit was punctuated by music and both of us had enjoyed just sitting and listening. We had not experienced music in any other cathedral but it filled the space and allowed people to just enjoy. We have visited many cathedrals and churches on our travels round France and even though I do not consider myself a deeply religious person I will never forget the size and scale of these buildings and the sense of calm that emanate within the walls. Arrival at McCarthys place They really are places of great beauty and serenity. We wrenched ourselves away from Villeneuve head to the north of the Auvergne region and travelled up to Ros and Mac’s place which is situated near the small town of Ainay-de-Chateau via a lunch stop in Moulins. One of the nice parts of travelling up to the north was our conscious decision to use more D roads rather than the major AutoRoute. We saw so many ‘pretty’ villages on the journey – we could have stopped at lots of them and enjoyed a walk along a river or the outdoor seating at a local Tabac. I think one of the more enjoyable parts of the last few weeks has been the chance to experience new areas of France – many of which we would not have gone to. Someone said to us on this trip that they were heading off to see the ‘prettiest village in France’ I have no idea how they could choose which one wins. They all look amazing and the judges must be fraught when they announce their findings – in my mind the debate that was immediate once the subject came out shows Ros and Macs how hard it is to separate the towns and villages. I visited at least three finalists in my mind during the week. The town of Moulins was a nice surprise – it too had a slightly grey look to it as we drove in but once amongst the lovely historical buildings and streets it was charming. I mean it had to be nice once we got there – Coco Chanel began a less well known cabaret career in Moulins and I cannot see her spending much time in a dump. Once again the focal point was the cathedral that we walked up to along streets that could have been in England – winding and tight they disguised the gentle rise up to the cathedral but once there you could look back at the town below. We shared the view with a bride and groom who were busy with a photographer and they were trying hard to find places to take photos without a horde of tourists behind – using public spaces on a Saturday afternoon was not their best idea and they may forever have my head in the background peering round the corner at the bride. My Inspector Morse The really old oak trees like deductions told me that the wedding may have taken place within the walls of the cathedral as white ribbon was still over the seats inside and confetti had blown over the steps. A religious building had stood on the site since the 1500s and the building was called a cathedral from 1822 – the two styles used in construction of the cathedral being Flamboyant of the 1500s and neo-Gothic in the 19th Century. Who can complain with stops like this – even the omelette in the square was good! It is hard to put into words and many may say good – stop now our stay at Ros and Mac’s French home called ‘La Bolotterie’. When we first thought of going to France we considered moving to a village for a year and enjoying what village life brought. There was a romantic ideal of biking to markets and enjoying Pastis in local bars with more importantly the locals. We may have whittled our first idea down to eight weeks in France but I think we got very close to our original idea this last week. I may need to add a disclaimer to this story due Bourges to the fact that when we arrived friends we knew from Ellesmere were already staying at the house but it was nice to see Isobel and Trevor and a good few laughs were had We had visited Ros and Mac earlier in the trip at their home in Shropshire and I had been lucky enough to have a spin round the country lanes in Mac’s brand new Morgan 3 Wheeler – sadly the car had not made the trip and with the weather that the UK has had over summer not many more miles have been put on the clock since I sat in it. Mac is promising himself to bring it across the Channel next year it would be fantastic in and around the lanes near their village. Their home is nestled on the edge of the Forest de Tronçais which was once the hunting domain of the French Royal Family. It is also one of the largest oak forests in the country and the tens of thousands of hectares provided much of the wood for the French Naval ships – both for building and for fuel once ships became steam propelled. Paul and I could have made a MRDS in the garden thousand sheds out of them. Wandering through the forest is not easy and any turn could see you lose your bearings as every direction looks just the same undergrowth giving way to rows and rows of tall oak trees. Off one path is the ‘Font de Lait’ which is a natural spring that feeds down through the trees. At certain times of the year the area of the spring comes alive with white wild Garlic flowers and it gives off the impression that milk is flowing out through the undergrowth. Paul and I would not have been allowed to touch three of the trees which are protected by 1899 French legislation due to their age. These trees are 450 years old and you come across them in the middle of one of the forest sectors. They appear to just loom up out of the mottled surrounds. The oldest one had shed a branch – quite a substantial one and thankfully no one was around. It had landed on the information sign that explained its age if it had landed on you it would have ended your visit to the tree fairly quickly. We did take home a souvenir to hang Herisson on the wall of the cottage which Ros will add her considerable artistic talents to. Our visit to Herisson meaning Hedgehog saw us climb amongst the castle ruins and look down on the medieval town with its orange tiled rooftops. The river cut through the village and we enjoyed a picnic with chilled Rose and a few ends of boule. Throw a beret on me and I could be Chevy Chase. Near the tiny village of La Bouteille which lies in the Troncais Forest area there is the touching monument to Royal Canadian Air Force Halifax crew who crash landed while on a bombing mission in 1943. It really is in the middle of nowhere and is a clear reminder that when a plane came down there was no control on its landing. It had been on a raid to bomb the German controlled Dunlop factory at Montlucon and was brought down within the forest – famers found wreckage scattered amongst the trees. Amazingly all survived and although some were captured many evaded the Germans through the assistance of the French Resistance who were active amongst the dense forest. Pilots were squirreled away to nearby villages – The famous boule match including Ainay-de-Chateau. The memorial is poignant in that all survived and their bravery is summed up in the somewhat short but accurate message of We flew We fell We survived”. I am sure there are many more tributes throughout France that say similar things – it is worth a visit and in the fields behind there is a chapel no more than a small room that has stood there for centuries. Its altar is still kept and the door is open so push it and be amazed we were. I have read more on the crash and have found some more information http//cvirlo.jimdo.com/claude-et-pierre-virlogeux/pierre-virlogeux/john-murray-forman-2-english-version/ Mac got me back on a bike and we cycled the few miles to the lake where Ros and I swam in an electrical storm being watched by a bemused French crowd – I think they smelled blood and could sense a toasted Kiwi floating to the surface. We were removed by the lifeguard when the lightning bolts reached the trees on the other side. Our ride ended with a couple of beers at the local bar – in fact our run the next day through the forest ended in the same place. It Picnic at the river was nice just being part of the community and meeting Ros and Mac’s many friends added to the enjoyment. Over the last twenty years they have met and been befriended by many of the locals and we spent time at three different houses. Andre and Christianne had us over for a swim in their pool to meet their grandchildren and much food and aperitifs Alain and Nicole served us champagne and pizza in the garden of their stunning old mill house Jean Francoise and Evelyne entertained us for an impromptu lunch on our way to visit Sancerre – we never did make Sancerre and left their house with the afterglow of the homemade plum brandy on our lips we also met Michelle and Josette who gave us some pointers for Paris where they live for six months of the year. They were all wonderful and made us feel so welcome and put up with my very poor impersonation of French. The French have also been known to be a bit suspicious of British cuisine – it’s all boiled or roasted to them. I think we knocked their socks off when they came to dinner Mac & Ros slow cooked NZ Ros and Mac at Herisson lamb on the BBQ Narelle made a salmon and lime salad and chocolate pots and I helped fill their glasses with some very good wine. They went away ‘’very ‘appy”. It was just a great week with an Auberge visit in Tronçais and to a wonderful outdoor restaurant next to the Abbaye de Noirlac. It was here that we were relegated to the tables by the car park lime tree due to the fact that we did not want to eat the Menu Gastronomique. There was great hilarity as the actual restaurant area was empty bar for two tables and it was windy and it took quite some effort to place the paper mats out! But rules are rules. Mac and I chucked the Frisbee around the garden while BBQs were lit – this included being introduced to Mac’s local game of Frisbee tennis. I was thrashed. We went on a trip to Bourges and once again found ourselves in a Gothic cathedral – the view of it as you drive into the area is amazing seen from miles away it must have been quite a sight all those centuries ago as people walked across the fields Herisson and plains. As we drove back from the non-Sancerre visit we could not believe how it sat so much higher than any building. Thanks Ros and Mac for a great week – it was simply brilliant and we are so pleased you suggested coming to visit the hospitality reached new heights when Mac started to clean our car on the eve of taking it back. After the last few weeks we are refreshed and ready to attack the final weeks of our trip. Leaving the McCarthy’s we pointed the car in the direction of Paris and headed off. Ros and Mac left in the other direction on bikes and went to be officials at the local triathlon while we drove to Paris via the spectacular chateau at Fontainebleau – it reminded us of the palaces we had visited in St Petersburg as we walked through the gardens. It was our last chance to drive amongst the villages and fields of France and we both noted that in the seven weeks we have been here the sunflowers have finally disappeared – the last crops await their harvest but the bright yellow flowers are long since finished. It must Halifax Memorial be a sign that it is time to move on. We drove to the outskirts of Paris and at Orly airport we dropped off the car. It was Day 118 of the lease and as we pulled into the depot we brought up 9163km on the clock – not a bad effort for the trip. The 9000km mark had been recorded just hours before on the A6 to Paris. More than half of those kilometres were done in France over the last 7 weeks. Giving back the car was easier than picking it up – I signed off the ownership back to Peugeot and within minutes was back to being a non-owner of a car when I own one again is anyone’s guess! This was the beginning of the end of the French sector of the trip. We now have three nights in Paris and then a flight to Barcelona. We have lots of favourite visits and ideas of what to see in Paris and we have promised ourselves a walking tour of sorts. We have been spoilt in France it has all been incredible and I can only foresee the capital of the Republic being just Lunch near Sancerre as memorable. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 26 Displayed 26 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Matt and Narelle crowsnezt Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do.

I am back in familiar and familial territory this morning as I awake in sunny Ballina at my brothers’ home having spent the night there. I managed to offload my partner in crime at Wardell which is 15km south of the home of the Big Prawn. He spent the night with a family member there. We reconvened at a café in the main street this morning. It was clear from the outset that I would be driving as it appears that last night Chris had met all the locals at the Wardell Recreational Club over a beer or two. He seemed to have been very taken with a big hairy sugarcane farmer called Jim. At this stage I am beginning to think my night wasn’t that bad after all sitting around a radio listening to the football. Don’t ask. So having had our morning injection of caffeine we headed North destination Rainbow Beach. Not before I had taken Chris on Adam’s tour of Ballina and environs though. I identified numerous points of interest from my years of visiting my family up here. The old house the current house the court house the manor house the Bushman Adams Handiwork lighthouse the beaches the golf course East Ballina shops the swimming pool the library and of course Bunnings. I must say that I was a bit disappointed in Chris’ lack of enthusiasm. I could swear that he nodded off between the Golf Course and the East Ballina shops. He also wasn’t impressed that I took him a scenic route through Lennox Head and Byron Bay. However we did see a rainbow painted road bridge on the Hinterland Way out of Byron. Now there’s something you don’t see every day. It wasn’t long after that we were hurtling up the expressway heading for Queensland. It is a strange State Queensland. Not long after crossing the border we came across a billboard with a picture of a man wearing glasses and a big smile. Written next to him in large capital letters was DR SNIP” and under that walk in walk out” and under that Vasectomy” and a phone number. There was no need to say anything. Not long after that we were assaulted by signs for Worlds”. Movie World Dream World Water World Aussie World Steve Irwin World. We were desperately seeking another giant object that we could Feel the Serenity have our photo taken with. We surmised that there could be a giant Akubra Hat at Aussie World but not so. Our last hope prior to leaving the mayhem of the motorway was the Ginger Factory could there possibly be a giant piece of ginger? Alas no. We did find some solace though whilst reminiscing about the time we stumbled across the big Murray Cod on our last camping trip. By this time Chris had taken over the driving and he advised me that we weren’t going all the way to Rainbow Beach but we are camping at Poverty Bay. This place lives up to its name as they couldn’t even afford a sign for the turn off which we realised as we sailed past. Poverty Bay is in the Cooloola National Park and is accessed by four wheel drive vehicles only. Once on the track we could see why. Deep sandy furrows dictated the terrain of the road and after about 5 minutes in we made the executive decision to engage the 4WD as it was becoming quite difficult. Just as we did this at the next corner the track flattened out and you could have driven a moped on it. Typical. We found the campsite and it is stunning. The sun is setting over the water as we erect our tent for the first time with a minimum of fuss. We erect the other things we need seamlessly. Bushman Adam starts a fire its perfect. Life is good.This is what it is all about. Hey Chris can you pass me the Aeroguard? There’s a few mozzies about…………..Chris the Aeroguard?” After a few well chosen expletives Chris advises me that he has left it at home. This was the cue for Mossie apolcalypse. As soon as the sun went down the unmistakable whine became a low drone as masses of hungry Mosquitos left their watery dwelling in search of blood. We had to do something. This place is very secluded but we did notice a campsite down the track a bit. I suggested that one of us should go and ask those fellow possibly hillbilly queenslander campers if we can borrow some insect repellent. I drew the short straw. As I walked up the darkening track I could see the silhouette of two men around a fire drinking beer. It was at this point I began to wish that I had never seen Deliverance. G’day fellas” I say in my finest Queenslander accent. Sorry to bother ya but my idiot mate left the Aeroguard at home ya wouldn’t have any I can bum off ya.

We were met in the hotel by our guide for the day Masako Unezaki. Our first stop was the island of Miyajima. We took a train to Miyajimaguchi and then a ferry across to Miyajima. Whilst we were on the train I asked a question about the railway. All the rail lines are run by JR - Japan Rail. The railway started off as a nationalised enterprise until 1 April 1987. It split into seven companies - six being passenger companies and one being a freight company. Although they all carry the same logo they are distinct companies they do not have a group holding company or a group headquarters they are all for-profit companies. When they were denationalised the government said that whilst they knew that some of the companies would make great profits whilst the smaller companies would not the public would not lose out. Wrong - the smaller loss making rural areas are having some of their services cut. They share the same ticketing system and you may travel across company boundaries Tori gate of Itsukushima shrine without having to change trains. Talking of transport even in the capital Tokyo we noticed that compared to Israel the UK or the US traffic congestion is nowhere near as bad. The public transport in Japan is amazing efficient ie it runs to time and clean. As we found out even if a train is two minutes late the apologies are profound and plentiful. The workers take great pride in their work. Back to our Miyajima boat ride From the ferry we could see the huge vermillion tori gate in the water indicating an entrance to a shrine. At high tide the path to the gate is submerged in the sea and it looks as if the gate is floating in the sea. But when the tide has gone out people can easily walk to the gate. There has been a gate here since 1168 but this one dates back to 1875. Masako was insistent in pointing out that when we land we are going to see hundreds of deer. The difference between these deer and those at Nara is that people are not encouraged to feed the deer here. They are wild and live on local Itsukushima shrine on Miyashima island vegetation. As long as they are on the island they are protected but if they find their way to the mainland they are game for hunters. Once we had disembarked from the ferry we walked along the sea front until we came to the Itsukushima Shrine. It is said that this shrine was erected by Tairo no Kiyomori a daimyo warlord in 1168. Part of it was rebuilt in 1571. There is another tori gate along this path which we had to pass through to reach the shrines. The first shrine is dedicated to three female deities. The name Itsukushima means island dedicated to the gods. The shrine is built like a pier over the water and it appears to float separate from the sea. Then we walked along a boardwalk and passed a wedding party. This shrine is a popular wedding venue. The shrine is guarded by two lions a male and a female. There is a second shrine that is dedicated to male deities and is called Sessha Marodo-jinja. In addition to these two shrines there are 17 other buildings. The whole complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and six of the buildings have been designated Kukai Kobo Daishi founded Shingon Buddhism National Treasures by the Japanese government. Then we were taken to the Daisho-in Temple. This is a Buddhist temple. Buddhism and the Shintō religion work very well together. The Shintō religion does not believe in an afterlife whereas Buddhist followers do. So with both religions co-existing believers can take bits from each religion. In the past when a person married a priest was not required a marriage was consecrated by the drinking of three cups of sake. Now many couples have a more formal religious ceremony and invite priests to play an obvious role. Since Japan became a democracy after WW2 there is a clear division between religion and state and religion is not taught in school. The steps leading up to the Daisho-in Temple were quite steep and there were a lot of them. So I found a bench and worked on my crossword and let Don and Masako do the exploring. The temple is on Mount Misen which is the holy mount on the island. It was founded in 806 by the monk Kukai. Kukai who later became known as Kobo Daishi was the founder of Shingon Buddhism. It was the place to pray for guide Masako Unezaki co-wrote Daisho-in Temple brochure the peace and security of the nation. We had first heard about this Buddhist sect and its founder when we stayed in Koyasan see Days 12 + 13. As Don and Masako proceded up the steps to the Daisho-in temple she explained that although people from the surrounding area would pray here at this local shrine they would arrange their burials at Okunoin cemetery in Koyasan That is becase they believe that when Buddha ushers in the ultimate future world Okunoin is closer to heaven and they will reach the afterlife more quickly. In fact Masako said that there are those who hold this belief all over the country which is why Okunoin cemetery Is so large. Masako was a most knowledgeable guide to lead Don to the Daisho-in temple. In fact she was a co-author of the brochure which covers a broad range of topics related to the Miyajima Misen Daiso-in Temple. Not only does it portray and describe the buildings and religious objects that are seen on a visit but it also explains the basics of Shingon Buddhism and its relationship to the other buddhist sects. Along the two flights of steps steep and steeper leading up small statues of Shaka Norai disciples with colourful caps by Diasho-in temple to the shrine are writings from sutra - Buddhist scripture. They adorn the vertical posts that support the railings of the steps. People are encouraged to touch the sutra texts and to spin those which are designed to turn freely on their axis. Alongside the rising path to the temple are 500 small statues. These represent the disciples of Shaka Norai and all have different facial expressions. Their heads are covered by colourful knitted caps. Worshippers make and replace the caps when they become frayed or weather-worn so that they always look fresh.The temple area contains many buildings each housing different important figures or objects. One of the shrines has a giant mandala. This is a multi-coloured circle consisting of intricate designs made with sand. It is hard to imagine the time and effort that its creators expended in arranging zillions of grains of sand with the appropriate colours to form the designs. Eventually Masako and Don came back down and found me. Masako took us to a cafe that was frequented by vegetarians. They assured us that they used no fat when cooking for vegetarians and they prepared the dish that was popular on the island which was Ground Zero of Hiroshima A-bomb stir fried vegetables with an omelette on the top. It was tasty. Whilst we were having lunch Masako explained that before WW2 nobody had the suffix ko on their names as this was a suffix only used by the aristocracy. After the war many of her generation were given names with ko at the end because their parents could! After lunch it began to rain and we took the motor launch from Miyajima directly to The Peace Park in Hiroshima city. By the time we landed it was raining quite heavily. The park is over 120000 square meters. Before the atomic bomb the area was the political and commercial heart of Hiroshima. It was also the military headquarters which was the main reason that the bomb was dropped there. We started at the hospital which had a plaque outside noting that the hospital was actually the hypocentre of the bomb ie ground zero. Then we walked to the A-Bomb Dome known as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. This was one of the few buildings that was left standing albeit not fully intact. The bomb exploded at 815 am on 6 August just 15 minutes after the town was at its Memorial for Sadako the girl who folded cranes busiest as people started work and school at 8 am. When the bomb exploded it generated a temperature between 3000 and 4000 degrees celcius. Everything and everyone in the immediate vicinity became incinerated. There were stories of lucky survivors like a man in the A-Bomb Dome building who was in the basement collecting documents from the safe room at that moment. Masako’s father aged 16 was assigned to a group evacuating people from the town because of the regular bombing raids. For some reason his group were reassigned another day and he survived. She never knew of his trauma until his funeral when his colleagues related his story. From the dome we walked to a bridge from where we could see the eternal flame. Then we walked to an exhibition of paper cranes made by children. The story goes that a young girl named Sadako was caught up in the fringe of the blast area but was thought to be ok after the blast. She developed leukaemia but her parents couldn’t afford the pain killers. She had a goal of folding 1000 paper cranes before she died. The folding of the cranes was supposed to have helped her through paper cranes continue to memorialise Sadako the pain. However she only folded 644. Her school friends completed her task and the cranes were buried with her. Every day cranes from around the world arrive at the park and they are exhibited. After some time the paper is recycled and made into postcards bearing the logo of the park. Masako told us that every family has been affected. Her mother died at the young age of 34 and Masakos own daughter died at the age of 10. Many women suffer miscarriages. Then we went to the Peace Park museum. This contains gruesome pictures of the victims and the devastation of the city. On another floor there is the history of the atomic bomb. Ironically the idea of the bomb was a German one. In 1938 some nuclear physicists in a laboratory in Berlin discovered nuclear fission. Another section of the Peace Park museum describes the political situation regarding countries who have signed up to nuclear disarmament. I too have a connection with Hiroshima. My father was part of the clean-up team at the end of the war. He had photos of ash outlines of persons. He never spoke of his experiences. But he did come home with a samurai sword which was stapled to the ceiling of his cousin’s ‘bar room’. Don and I were pleased to leave the museum which was a very heavy experience really the only one in our Japanese touring. The three of us then went to have ice cream partly for its uplift factor before returning to the hotel in a taxi. That evening we decided to scavenge for food. In the hotel lift somebody noticed Don’s kippa and said shalom. I thought that they were taking the mickey until they started speaking Ivrit. I spoke to them in my broken Hebrew - they now live in San Francisco. When I said we were from Ra’anana one of the party said that she was the cousin of a friend of ours. Our friend couldn’t believe that of all the places in the world to meet it would be Hiroshima. Guess what we had for supper? Yep - sushi! . « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Lesley & Don Nadel the antipodean adventurers Two retired travellers continue roaming the world after our first great adventure. ... full info Joined December 6th 2012 Trips 14 Last Login June 18th 2019 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 177 Guestbook 24 Photos 1273 Forum Posts 0 blog=1034481 blogger=255888 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1034481 blogger=255888 Advertisement Brief history of Japan In 1603 a Tokugawa shogunate military dictatorship ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power.

After checking at the bus station our lost hotel key was succesfully located at another bus station. Within 45 minutes it was returned to us and we gratefully received a refund of our £100 fine. An example of the time being meticulously noted in Japan the bus returning out key was running 2 minutes late and a note was left to inform me! After the key delay we set off for Inuyama in the sunshine. We ate the remains of our bargain dinner for lunch Id discovered reduced stickers at the supermarket and discovered the two items we thought to be pork escalopes were potato! Inuyama had a worn feel to it. There were a number of closed shops and tired looking buildings. It had similar wooden building to Tsumago and Magome. A kind gesture shown to us today was a gentleman relieving me of our rubbish bag as I stood baffled by the numerous categories for recycling. The town has two National Treasures an original castle and an old tea house. The castle on the hill was dainty. It is the oldest castle remaining in Japan. We had a friendly volunteer guide though More traditional housing some of her information was a little suspect and George knew more than her about some parts of the castle! The beams inside have been chiseled by adze and are huge The floorboards are also rather large the stairs steep and the views from the top panaoramic. We could see across to the enemy at Gifu castle. The second national treasure of the day was the tea house. Set in a mossy woodland garden  within 3 minutes of us starting the walk another enthusisastic volunteer found us and our tour began. I paid an extra £5 for a tea serving which George baulked at! What I learned 1 – eat a sweet bean swirl 2 – receive tea bowl with picture facing toward me 3 – pick up bowl in both hands 4 – turn clockwise 180 to face picture outward 5 – drink tea in three slurps 6 – wipe rim of bowl with thumb and index finger 7 – compliment the tea hostss upon collection It was all very precise and makes us English tea drinkers appear slobbish with only the perked up little finger to Random performance remember! Now were on the train to Takayama. The railway is snaking through a stunning forested valley. A river is running through carving a craggy gorge with huge boulders. Its an amazing commute for all the office workers on the train with us compared to Godalming to Waterloo. I guess the beauty has worn off though as most people are asleep or tapping on their Android phones! « Previous Entry Additional photos below Photos 17 Displayed 17 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message George Leach GeorgeandKat Were a recently married couple off on an adventure.

My co had gotten the earliest tickets to Tazawako so we were out of Sendai by 637am. Lake Tawazako is the deepest lake in Japan. Legend goes that Princess Tatsuko and a dragon god fell in love and their passionate love making is what keeps the lake from freezing over in the coldest of temperatures. The tourist information center had nothing but good things to say about this and were very helpful in getting the bus schedule and everything to us. My co and I ended up at the Tazawako station at 830am and without further ado we set out to a little exploration hiking. Yes we did this with our packs on. It being a Sunday and everything there was almost no action going on around the town. We started out towards the surrounding mountains. We found a small path that lead us to the Obonai Park which is one of the funnest places I have seen yet. We abandoned our packs at the base of the stair master that awaited us or the stairs leading to the park. It had some awesome Tazawako park gear and some nice walking paths up to the top of a hill that had some great views of the town and of course a shrine. The shrine was a great place to take pictures with the torii gates and to get an amazing view of Tazawako. On our way down we stumbled across a temple that was in the midsts of being built and then set out to the station to catch our bus to out hostel. Out hostel was this amazingly huge place right by the lake. We were allowed to leave our packs in the waiting area while we went out and walked around and find some lunch. My first views of Tazawako were amazing. The lake in almost 20 miles in diameter and around surrounded by hills and slight mountains. The water is this intense shade of green and could not have been prettier. The funniest part was the lake paddle boats that were left sitting in the sand. Giant swans cars airplanes and dragons were sitting in straight lines along the walk way waiting in silence for the spring and summer months to come. My co and I headed out to OREA for Obonai park lunch. Its got some amazing views of the lake and some great microbrews. Afterwards we headed back to the hostel and waited for the bus to come and take us to the Nyuto Onsen. Nyuto Onsen is a small grouping of natural hot springs deep in the mountains. The bus ride up was a little long 40 minutes and by the time we got up to the top it was snowing heavily and my co and I found ourselves at the end of the line and headed down to the onsen that would pick you up from the bus with an umbrella to keep the snow off you. It was the most amazing place. For 700 yen you wash and then sit in hot mineral baths for as long as you want. Absolutely amazing. Our onsen was an rotenburo or outdoor bath so sat around the inner bath for a bit and then moved outside and found ourselves being snowed on while enjoying a roaring stream. The view was straight out of a wookblock print. Absolutely spectacular. The fun part of the onsen was finding out that it was a mixed sex rotenburo. Yes I sat in a towel and the view chatted with a business man sitting next to me in the same bath as me. Dinner was at 6pm at the hostel so my co and I waited for the bus and rode back in the dark and rain to the most amazing dinner. We were served traditional Akita soup Kiritampo our own yakiniku burner and some of the most amazing fish I have ever eaten. One of the best meals I have ever had in my life and yes I got a photo of the finner before I ate it. After dinner we settled into our room and read for a couple of hours before I fell asleep at 930pm. Breakfast on Monday was bright and early at 730am and was very delicious and nutritious. We woke up to a heavy snow that had covered the ground and trees over night. We settled back into our room to enjoy the heating unit before going out into the snow to hike around the lake and find the statue of Tatsuko. Now here is the funny part of out day. My co who had been to Tazawa before said we should walk to the statue and then catch the the shrine loop bus to see the O-Torri and then catch a bus into town and wait for our shinkansen to come. So off we set for the statue until natures call came up and I had to make good use of the woods by a park. When I looked up I saw the highway sign proudly stating that the statue was 9km away. Thats 5 miles from where we were standing. We decided to be brave and walk to the statue and catch the bus. There wasnt going to be much else for us to do until our shinkansen @ 6pm anyway. So we walked and walked and almost stopped and turned back or would find one of the bus stops and think about waiting in the snow for it to come pick up us. On our walk we found a lot of parks some construction work and an abandoned tradition thatched farmhouse. It was finally getting close to noon and that was when the loop bus would arrive at the statue and we were still a decent distance from the statue. So we waited for about 5 minutes at the random bus stop we found and caught the bus Me and the town for the rest of the way around the lake. We grabbed lunch at a restaurant and dried our soaking shoes socks and jeans by one of the heaters. We were steaming from all the water that was drying off us. We caught the bus back to the station and waited around and read in a small cafe named People and chatted with the lady who runs the place. She had been to New York and was asking us where we were from and the like. One of her grandsons was there and he fell asleep at the bar. It was just too cute. We decided that we should stop loitering at this womens cafe and moved into the tourist information center for the last hour of our wait. I grabbed an awesome brochure for Akita and sat around until our shinkansen came. We had some funny business people wave at us from the shinkansen heading to Akita and then later when we stopped along side another shinkansen I smiled to another pair of business men who then smiled and waved back to me. It was awesome. The shinkansen only took an hour and a half to get back to along the park Sendai and I was out at 1030pm. I slept for almost 11 hours last night. It felt amazing and I think that my body really needed it. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 28 Displayed 26 « Back 1 2 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Kathryn Lebda Lebdawho I am currently living in Beppu Japan for a 2 year graduate study and exploring another part of Japan again.

PHOTOS - now uploaded... Along with several thousand other people I watched the Sydney fireworks on New Years Eve. We were at a great spot not too heaving because its a bit hidden away and not many people know about it - and while you cant see the opera house we had a wonderful view of the bridge and obviously the massive fireworks overhead. Plus we didnt have to sit there all day - I turned up at 6 and there werent many people there at all - and could have our own civilised picnic with a nice bottle of bubbly or two. I have heard stories of 2 hour queues to get into the Botanical gardens at noon and you also cant take your own alcohol or any glass in. Although because Martin wasnt sure about the glass rule where we were hed decanted some lovely champagne into a plastic water bottle which very classy... There is a shorter display at 9pm for the kids although as far as I could tell alot of them seemed to hang around for midnight anyway and these were pretty good themselves. Then at midnight the real thing started and it was fantastic. Ill NYE in Sydney The sunset as we waited for midnight... upload a couple of photos which wont do it justice. Mum and dad were sharing the experience with me watching the live coverage on Sky news. Its slightly odd though because theres no countdown and it feels like youre waiting for the fireworks rather than the new year. On New Years Day after doing a bit of life admin I strolled down to the Botanical gardens myself as I hadnt yet been to Mrs Macquaries point - amazingly there was hardly any debris. Whilst I was there I managed to get bitten by something on my wrist - I didnt see what it was and it was a painful nip so of course in the first couple of minutes I was thinking redback. But when I hadnt collapsed 2 minutes later I figured I was probably OK. Whatever it was my arm swelled up a fair bit and hasnt yet totally recovered. Evil critters in Australia. So then I had 3 wonderful days in the Blue Mountains - so named because they are supposed to have a blue-ish hue due to the thousands and thousands of eucalypts which affect the particles in the atmosphere. They didnt look very blue to Sydney harbour The excitement builds as the party boats glide past me. However it is a stunning area. I stayed in a great hostel in Katoomba a 25 minutes walk from the popular Echo falls lookout where you can see the Three Sisters. This was great and I had a lovely walk the first day but the next couple of days involved some proper hiking up and down mountain cliffs and through rainforests - firstly near the Wentworth Falls and then the Grand Canyon in Blackheath. Some beautiful sights interesting walking and enough uphill to make you feel youd really earned that hot shower nice cup of tea and something chocolate-based Incidentally I have been introduced to an Aussie treat known as Jaffas - orangey chocolatey crunchy things - I think I might be addicted. My companions during these walks were various people from the hostel. Its good to walk with other people obviously for the fun side of getting to know people - but there are a couple of spots where one can go the wrong way if one is not careful. And I didnt want to do that again! I had a final day back in Sydney where I caught up with the Irish girls I met in South Martin and me Trying a self-portrait Africa and had a nice glass of wine in Hyde Park with Martin before finally saying farewell. Then yesterday it was time to get back on the Greyhound my old friend from the west coast for a 9 hour trip up to Bellingen a very small town about halfway between Sydney and Brisbane. Its a very different place to what Ive been used to in Oz - an old hippy town really although more city influences have come in in recent decades. It is also the home to David Helfgott the Australian concert pianist with the Schizoaffective disorder whose life inspired the film Shine. I shall look out for him when I go grocery shopping and tell him how much I helped increase his royalties when I was at Classic. The hostel has lovely mountain views and a river running past it and is a wonderfully easy place to relax - I had been intending on doing a big walk here tomorrow but I think stopping and doing nothing for a couple of days is probably what the doctor ordered after a social couple of weeks in Sydney. There are also thousands of fruit bats living in the trees over Martin and me Thats better the river - and at 8ish every night they take to the skies over the hostel - its an amazing if slightly scary sight! Also as we are much more in the bush here Im trying not to think about the possible proximity of funnel-web spiders. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 14 Displayed 14 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Joanna Wilson Jo on an adventure Im taking what they call a career break and travelling round the world some of it anyway.

I have dreamt of going to Montserrat for years now. This was definitely quite high on my list of things to do in my lifetime. After the Cinque Terre debacle I was a little scared that it would not live up to my expectations. It did and more! I took the R5 train to the Montserrat-Aeri station which is about an hour away from Barcelona. About halfway in the journey this big group of kids got on. The decibel level definitely went up a notch. This is a train that makes many many stops and it was funny because every time we would start up again the kids in unison would let out this whoa. It is also always entertaining to see how excited they truly are for simple things like riding a train. I can only imagine what they were like when they actually reached Montserrat! There are two ways to go up the mountain. The first is referred to as rack rail which is essentially a train ... mmm interesting. The other is a cable car. More my speed! When I arrived the station was actually closed and was only set to open about 10 minutes later. 2 It gave me time to just sit and soak in the already amazing view and indulge in a cafe cortado. I also noticed that the conductor seemed to do a practice run with the cable car before letting us in. It was also relatively quiet in the cable car despite the fact that there was about 20 of us. Those are some serious heights we were reaching! There was also this odd murmur or sense of easiness when we arrived at one of the poles and the car jostled a little bit. The first stop would be the Basilica. As with any churches the inside is ornate and this one was quite dark. It is also relatively small. You also have a view of the procession of people visiting the star attraction of the basilica. After having gone around a little bit I made my way to the line to go see La Morenata Black Virgin. This is a statue of Mary with the infant Jesus which dates from the 12th Century. She holds a sphere of the universe in her right hand. Jesus holds a pineapple which apparently is a symbol of life and fecundity. The line 3 Getting in line for my ride up the mountain is long but moves swiftly. The statue is behing a plastic shield but the sphere of the universe is left out and you are allowed to rub it. There is a security guard right there to make sure that the crowd keeps flowing swiftly. As you walk out of the basilica you walk through the Path of Ave Maria. It is a path lined with votive candles. The holders are integrated into these shallow grottos. It gives quite an atmosphere and it is quite beautiful. The next stop would be the museum. It is a relatively small museum but they have an impressive collection. There are paintings by Renoir Chagall Monet Picasso Dali to name a few. The discovery for me was a Barcelona-born painter called Ramon Casas. There is also a section dedicated to the iconography of the Santa Maria of Montserrat. It is essentially a series of paintings and sculptures that depict the statue of Mary that I had just seen in the basilica. It was interesting to see the different interpretations. There was also a section called the Icons of the Oriental Church. These were primarily pieces painted on wood. The background is often gold 4 And theres my ride!! and there are religious depictions painted in bright colour. The detail is incredible. Ive seen quite a few of these along this whole trip but I do have to say that this particular selection were simply gorgeous. There are of course many many Madonna and Child. There was also a temporary exhibit and that just floored me. I have said it before that I am not that knowledgeable about art. What I do know is what I like and what I dont like. There are definitely things that I can either relate to or that touch me in some way. This particular exhibit was just ... it left me speechless. I sat on the little bench in the room and stared. The artist is Jaime Sunico and the exhibit was called Monks. This was a series of only 21 paintings. You first enter one large room which is painted in a dark blue and the only thing at the very end of this room is one canvas and it is a painting of a monks hands. You then walk into the adjoining room. It too is dark blue and dimly lit. Around the room are 20 portraits of monks 5 From the cable car from France Spain and Egypt. It is just them from the waist up. Some are smiling some are somber. Some are young some are old. The ones from Egypt are distinct because they have beards and their cloak has some ornamentation. The eyes were vivid that you felt like they were looking right through you. I know that it may sound odd but it was just a stunning exhibit. The ambience in the room was surreal. I then hopped on the funicular Sant Joan which brings you up a further 250 meters. From there I hiked through some of the paths. It affords incredible views. You can also little churches and former hermitages that are unfortunately in a sad state of affairs. It was just an amazing way to spend the day. There are some hiking paths that take over an hour. I wish that I would have had the time to fit them in. But by the time I did the couple of paths it was already late afternoon. So back down on the funicular I went. I poked around a couple of the small shops before heading back down on the cable car to go catch my 6 train. I already consider myself very lucky to having had the experience of this day ... but boy would I ever love to come back to hit some of those other trails!! So tomorrow ... Valencia. The goal is to eat paella it was invented there! and a Valencia orange. All about the food!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 73 Displayed 26 « Back 1 2 3 4 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Caroline carfour Travelling ... is there anything better?

February 15 - 20 Doha Qatar As is our wont whenever possible to add a place weve not been to our itinerary we stopped for five days in Qatar on our way to the Jean-Pictet International Humanitarian Law competition in Denpasar Bali Indonesia. Souq Waqif Doha A must when in Doha the Souq Waqif which comes alive at night We stayed at a super nice hotel very near all the places we wanted to **visit and had a fabulous visit. Taxis were readily available and very reasonable so we didnt rent a car. For our countryside excursion we hired a car and driver - very reasonable and well worth it. **Qatar Islamic Art Museum National Museum of Qatar various architectural treasures like mosques cultural centers government buildings Waqif Souq. The weather in Doha in February was delightful - sunny and dry with warm days and cool nights. You could wear summer clothing had to be modest during the days but a jacket at night was welcome. Although there is no dress code as such for foreigners it is better to wear modest clothes and conservative clothing is recommended. This implies no shorts for men and no mini-skirts or tank tops for women. Foreign visitors are expected to dress in a style that is sensitive to Islamic culture. Local women wore chador and we saw some with niqab but expat workers and foreigners just dressed modestly. Qatar is a very safe country to travel in. Its Entrance to restaurant in souq crime rates are low including violent crimes that are extremely rare especially towards foreigners. Background & History A country of eastern Arabia on a peninsula in the southwest Persian Gulf Qatar is a traditional monarchy. It was a British protectorate from 1916 until 1971 when it became independent. Oil was first produced commercially in 1949 and its production still dominates Qatars economy. In early 2017 Qatars total population was 2.6 million 313000 Qatari citizens and **2.3 million expatriates. Islam is the official religion of Qatar. The country has the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar is classified by the UN as a country of very high human development and is widely regarded as the most advanced Arab state for human development. Qatar is a high-income economy backed by the worlds third-largest natural gas and oil reserves. **Seems that ALL the workers in Qatar were from somewhere else Indians being the biggest ex-pat population but we met workers from the Philippines Bangladesh Pakistan Egypt Macedonia and Kenya. In fact our total interaction with the locals was with expatriate workers. Qatar has amassed a sovereign wealth Qatar Natl Museum of Islamic Art Most of the modern buildings in Doha were built in the last 10 years such as this museum fund of $170 billion thanks to revenues from oil and natural gas. It has begun to invest it like a hedge fund. In 2006 Qatar passed Indonesia to become the largest exporter of liquid natural gas in the world with revenues from oil and natural gas amounting to 60%!oMISSINGf Qatars GDP. Qatar has been ruled by the House of Thani since Mohammed bin Thani signed a treaty with the British in 1868 that recognized its separate status. Following Ottoman rule Qatar became a British protectorate in the early 20th century until gaining independence in 1971. In 2003 the constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum with almost 98%!iMISSINGn favor. In the 21st century Qatar emerged as a significant power in the Arab world both through its globally expanding media group Al Jazeera Media Network and reportedly supporting several rebel groups financially during the Arab Spring. For its size Qatar wields disproportionate influence in the world and has been identified as a middle power. Qatar is currently the subject of a diplomatic and economic embargo by Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates UAE Bahrain and Egypt which began in June 2017. Saudi Arabia Idam Restaurant in Natl Museum of Islamic Art We happened upon the this French Restaurant at the Museum of Islamic Art owned by the Emirs sister and what an experience we had 5 starters in addition to soup salad a trolly of amazing breads a main and 2 desserts. We were taken into meet the chef he was a young Frenchman and adorable and see the kitchen. We didnt have dinner that night needless to say. has proposed the construction of the Salwa Canal which would run along the Saudi-Qatar border effectively turning Qatar into an island. A big reason for the embargo is that Qatar shares a good relation with Iran. Both countries own the South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field the worlds largest gas field having a big influence in the Irani-Qatari relation. Saudi Arabia is at odds with Al Jazeera for their anti-Saudi reporting. Because of the embargo Qatar has started developing its own industries farms etc. For example they had no diary farms until the embargo but now produce enough dairy products for the entire country. The Qatari people are very proud of what theyve accomplished and we heard several voice the opinion that the embargo was a good thing - making them more self-reliant. During our countryside excursion we saw many new farms arising from the desert thanks to irrigation from desalinized ocean water. Our five days in Qatar were wonderful busy and extremely interesting. We highly recommend a visit if you are in the area or if like us you can fly through Doha AMAZING airport not unlike in Dubai and just UNESCO Site The walled coastal town of Al Zubarah in the Persian Gulf flourished as a pearling and trading centre in the late 18th century and early 19th centuries before it was destroyed in 1811 and abandoned in the early 1900s. A layer of sand blown from the desert has protected the remains of the site’s palaces mosques streets courtyard houses and fishermen’s huts its harbour and double defensive walls a canal walls and cemeteries. Excavation has only taken place over a small part of the site. stay a few days.

A seemingly 24-hour operation ships being loaded and released of their cargo as an arrangement of sirens and horns sounded out continuously. As dawn began to slowly creep in the low light projected an army of ants trailing up and down outside my tent. I watched them monotonously and just when I felt as if I was about to nod off I suddenly bolted upright shaking off my trance. 0430am I’d lounged around for long enough. My journey north was to continue. Heading out of Monbetsu I was again to be subjected to another one of Hokkaido’s consistently straight roads one that seemed to melt into the horizon and offer very little hope of curvature. My surrounds though were far from pedestrian to my right lay the sea of Okhotsk its salted breeze gentle and fresh. And to my left a landscape very reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands green wavy hills boggy marshes craggy rocks and a pint’s worth of midges heading directly for my eyeballs. The road was to eventually spoil me rotten by offering up Mobetsu a bend and before long as a set of heavy dark clouds began to loom I would make it to Hamatonbestu the last frontier before Wakkanai Hokkaido’s northern most city. Over a can of coffee outside a Seicomart I started talking to a Japanese tour cyclist who that day had set out from Wakkanai. He confirmed that the weather there was very wet windy and cold. And upon that confirmation I did not think that I would be able to make the final 50 or so miles before sundown. However on the outskirts of town lay a spot of luck - Kutcharo Lake. It offered convenient and free camping though an eerie mist clung to the lake upon my arrival. Close by a group of gulls gathered around a broken jetty preparing to roost they too had given up for the day. And as the drizzle turned to rain I’d just about finished preparing camp before huddling into my sleeping bag - with a packet of crab flavoured crisps and some fine 20th Century literature. For tonight the rain wasn’t going anywhere and neither was I. ------------------------------------------------------------ Tokyo to Tokyo - A Cycling Adventure around Japan.

I imagined teaching at this kind of school before I arrived! As I finish up this blog entry I have just a couple of days of school left though I have been working on these reflections throughout the term. Before I came back to Thailand to teach as I think I may have mentioned before I envisioned myself teaching in some quaint little village up in the north of Thailand- one that just had one school like the hill tribe village school Fiona and I saw on our trek out of Pai. TEFL made it sound as though that might be a possibility. I sort of wanted a Peace Corps-esque experience due to the fact that it was only 4-5 months. I pictured myself feeding the monks in the morning as they came around with their alms bowls and going to the temple with the locals on weekends. I understand that this was a rather romantic idea but it seemed possible. Instead most of my group ended up in one industrial city or another in Thailand. But my experience was certainly still real and I think I can still make some generalizations about the education system here in Thailand from my personal experience even though I was not teaching at a P.1 students This class is still my rowdiest. They talk constantly but are really quite adorable so it is difficult to stay annoyed with them. government school i.e. public school and from conversations with teacher friends at other schools. In our TEFL training we were taught that teachers are highly valued in Thailand and that therefore we would be well-respected by students and adults alike. We also learned that we should be careful of our behavior around town- not drinking or wearing revealing clothing etc. etc. Fortunately the latter wasnt seem a problem for me- I kept all my cavorting out of Chonburi on the weekends. Despite the fact that teachers are supposed to be highly esteemed there seems to be a huge difference in student behavior for Thai teachers vs. their behavior for foreign teachers. Its not quite the way I thought it might be over here in terms of immediate respect and exceptionally good behavior from students as Ive heard really IS the case in China and Korea. Even though I was really lucky to have very manageable class sizes it was an uphill battle in most of my classes to get students to stop talking over me and to listen or attempt to anyway if they didnt understand the English. I think that a Thai teacher was always supposed to be sitting in on all the classes and they sometimes were and sometimes werent but this could be both an asset and a hindrance anyway. It often helped to have the Thai teacher assist with classroom management in Thai and sometimes to explain something extra tricky to the students. When it didnt help was when they translated everything for the students therefore taking away the chance for the students to stretch their brains to understand and when they spent the entire time rebraiding all the girls hair in the class really!. The things that I really appreciate about the Thai education system are that schooling starts at a younger age so the students have 3 years of kindergarten the third year corresponding to our kinder in the U.S. It is hard to say if the students at my school are really representative of the whole population but by K.3 those little ones had their letters and numbers down in both Thai and English and could spell a lot of words too. If our public schooling included preschool or multiple years of kinder which is being pushed by early childhood specialists students would get a lot more exposure to letters and numbers before they are pushed and prodded into reading in kindergarten. Last year a lot of my students had never been to school before and were adjusting to the new environment along with the academics. Some of them knew hardly any letters at all at the beginning of the year but yet were expected to read by the end of the year. Another thing I like about the Thai system is that non-academic subjects are part of the regular curriculum promoted by the government. Art music P.E. health morality buddhist teachings and dancing are integral parts of the curriculum. At my school the littlest kids also took swimming lessons and had cooking class once a week. I felt that value was placed on all of these subjects and that there is an interest in well-roundedness. Now some downsides. The schooling here relies heavily on rote memorization and copying information into notebooks with less emphasis on problem-solving and critical thinking. Students are ready to spit back answers but if you probe a little deeper you often realize that they dont actually understand the concepts behind the answer and perhaps arent encouraged to do so. Neatness and copying are valued over reasoning. Once one of the foreign teachers was chastised because his writing on the board was slanting downward. Mine is terribly messy but luckily I never heard about it! The students would take maddeningly long copying down notes and information from the board so much so that what I thought would be 1 days lesson could easily stretch into 3 days. You see a lot of teacher at the front lecturing while students copy down notes. After that there is usually a passive workbook page to complete and answers are provided if students cant supply them. There is a no-failure policy in Thailand so even if a student never completes any work and gets a zero on all tests and assignments he/she must receive a passing grade. Failing a student would cause him/her and the family to lose face which is not acceptable in Thai society. While this doesnt play such a role at the primary level secondary teachers find it very difficult to motivate students since they know that they cant fail no matter what they dont do. The emphasis is often placed on completing workbooks instead of measuring actual learning which can be very frustrating! Apart from the education system the language barrier can be frustrating for classroom management and even more importantly for getting to know the students as individuals. Some of the youngest P.1 and P.2 especially persist in speaking to me in Thai and it is so painful to me when it seems like they really want an answer to something and I just have absolutely no idea what they are saying. What I enjoy most about teaching is the relationship that forms between the teacher and student and that is difficult when you dont have enough common language. I think in the future if I teach English again in a foreign country I would probably like it to be a Spanish-speaking one. Even if Spanish is banned in the classroom it is nice to be able to use it outside of class to get to know students better. Coming up on the end of the term Im really noticing that I have developed rapport with my students. In spite of the language barrier that stands tall between me and many of them we have grown to trust each other respect each other and hopefully to understand each other a little bit more. Its a shame that now that I finally feel so connected to them and know ways to get them more involved and less chatty its just about time to leave. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Laurie Rhoads lkrhoads This is my first attempt at a travel blog.

Singapore « Previous Entry Next Entry » Bangkok Repose Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Ampawa January 7th 2013 Published May 6th 2013Edit Blog Post Jaunty Jul Temple - Giving AlmsAmphawa It had been quite some time since I woke up at 6am in the morning. We were supposed to be giving alms to the monks who will be rowing down the river. It was a beautiful and peaceful morning. However the 2 of us were too sleepy to notice much. I just merely let my fingers do the clicking. As it was a Monday morning Amphawa felt very much like a dead town. No shops or anything was open. They were mainly for the locals and they are only open from Friday - Sunday afternoons. For those who like the crowds you might want to check out the other floating markets such as Damnoen Saduak Floating Market Taling Chan Floating Market Tha Kha Floating Market etc... There are several other homestay around Amphawa as well. I chose Baanrak Amphawa as I had wanted something that is really like a homestay and not a hostel or motel. The breakfast that they served us as we were waiting was their local delicacy - simple porridge something simple and nice. Simply love it! The fruit platter was amazing too. Hee 😊 For those who are on a tighter budget Baanrak Amphawa Breakfast you might want to try their neighbour instead - Baan Mae Arom. We were fortunate to meet them on our fireflies boat tour. The owner is a thai with Chinese descent hence he is able to converse in both halting English and fluent Chinese. We had a great time and I look forward to going back there soon for another round of relaxing holiday. But we will have to ensure that we get to experience the weekend floating market too! Ha! Back to Bangkok - for more SHOPPING!! We decided to head back to Bangkok for lunch as most of the stores in Amphawa were closed and there wasnt anything for us to do. Unfortunately we didnt know our way and we had a little communication problem. We didnt managed to take the same van company back. Fortunately we had not gotten our return tickets thus we were open to any changes in plans. Anyway we ended up following a local who was going back to Bangkok. We were lucky enough to get back to Bangkok safe and sound. There were several changes of transport - from open van to van but we still managed to get back Map of Siam Sky Walkway to victory monuments. We tried to follow the locals as the place they had dropped us was a little complicated. After which we took the BTS back to Rachathewi and headed over to Platinum Fashion Mall for more shopping. Im not a good shopper so we limited ourselves to 3 hrs max at the shopping mall and we headed off to find dinner. As I was hunting for a particular medicine my poor friend ended up with a backache. The only thing we got out of the long walks was the learning of the hotels and the covered walkway under the BTS station of Siam and Chit Lom. it was difficult finding the medicine I wanted. Back home....... As the last leg of the trip was a little rush I didnt managed to check out my buys till I got back to Singapore. My cat was extremely jealous of my buys and he displayed his dissatisfaction by messing them up. Ha. I bet he missed me as much as I missed him on this trip. I realized that I got several small items such as hair accessories from Platinum Shopping Mall and bags from Jealous Ling Ling Naraya there is an outlet at Asia Hotel as compared to clothings on this trip. Nevertheless this was the first relaxing trip I had in years. I was very grateful to this friend who took time off from work to accompany me on this fun and adventurous Amphawa try-out. Hope you guys find the information here useful in your planning for your trip to Amphawa Bangkok. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 12 Message Juli Lek Jaunty Jul About me JauntyJul is actually a compilation of couple of words = Jaunt + Aunty + Julianne This Aunty Julianne is taking time to enjoy the things she loves most - travelling eating photography and diving.

The parador ended up being more reasonable than I expected...the included breakfast was fantastic. That should hold us over for the whole day. Just simply driving is enjoyable. Villages on many hilltops. Almost got stopped by police again for crossing a solid white line. I quickly pulled out the camera and took pictures of them so that they would see it was another tourist. I couldnt resist the pictures of the villages and castles on the mountain and hill tops. We drove up to what looked like a castle and found it was a parador in Cardona. I was feeling like I made a mistake and should have stayed here...it was amazing. But then again you were totally isolated from the village below so mybe it wasnt such a good idea but this was a beautiful place to stay. Now it was on to Montserrat. It was a crazy drive to the top of the mountain. I was not prepared for the people when we got to Photo 2 the top...bus load after bus load. Man am I glad I ended up not staying at the hotel on site. i ended up getting one closer to the expressway as im concerned about the drive to the airport in the morning. in any event we got parked and found out that the Boys Choir would be performing in about 15 minutes. We literally ran the entire way and just barely got into the church as they began to sing. I was able to get a video of the performance which seemed to only last about 10 minutes. Glad we didnt get there earlier and sat way at the front. The weird rock formations are really quite impressive and can see why it is such an attraction. We then drove to Collbato which is literally around to the other side of Montserrat. Our hotel was quite nice and with an outdoor and indoor restaurant attached. We walked the entire town down the hillside to the small local church and playground then up the mountain to the Salnitre Caves. Of course they were closed but it was a great hike. Signs indicated the trail continued beyond the caves without the Photo 3 handrails around the mountain to where we had been earlier at Monestir de Montserrat...now that would be a hike. Perfect...Collbato has an entrance to the expressway. We got to bed in good time. Im a little unnerved by our car being locked inside the fence for security. No one speaks English and we want to get the car out at 6...gates typically open at 700. Just hope our communication was sufficient. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 25 Displayed 23 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Steve Berberich Berb Married to Ruth three daughters four grandchildren retired architect.

It was a 5 hour drive thru some incredibly beautiful country. Lynda and I went separately so that we could go on from there to visit more friends and family that she wanted me to meet and also to show me more of this beautful area. As much as I have traveled to different countries it still amazes me how much the landscapes resemble areas in our country. Lyndas aunt lives very close to the beach in Kianga and has a spectacular view. Because of the awful storms that Australia has been having we havent even got to get our feet wet at the beaches because of the high surf so I am hoping to spend time in the water in Bali. We stayed Wednesday night in a hotel a block from the beach in Narooma and we could see the beach and hear the waves. They have security screen doors that we could lock so we were able to sleep with the door open and hear the waves and have the fresh ocean breeze and be totally safe. It was wonderful. We had breakfast at a little bistro on the beach and took a walk along the beach that looked very much like the Oregon coast before we headed out again. It was overcast and breezy but warm. We have been blessed with good weather as we havent had much rain when we have been traveling. Its been at night or when we are done for the day. Haven neeeded sun block as it has been partly cloudy or overcast most of the time which is great because it has kept the temperature in the high 80s or low 90s so far. After leaving Narooma we headed back over the coastal range thru the Kosciuzko National Park. Mt Kosciuzko is the highest peak in Austalia at 7000. We stopped in Jinjabyne to have lunch with Heidi who was so welcoming to me as all her friends have been. I would say that at least 90% of the people that I have met no matter the age have been to the states at least once. AS we went thru the park we passed a beautiful ski area called Threadbo with 7 beginner or intermediate that we could see from the road lined by trees. With many more challenging ones we couldnt see. We passed one of their huge power plants that they pumped water to from lakes higher up thru 3 30in diameter white pipes. That way they keep those lakes full and just use the excess to keep them from flooding. Thru all the traveling we had done up to this point all i had seen was dead kangaroos. Lynda pulled off the road at this small local airstrip at Geehi because she said they were always on an airstrip. Sure enough there was a mob of about 20 there. Lynda said that in order to land on these local airstrips you have to buzz the strip first to scare them off so you can land. We saw a mom with twin joeys. I dont know how she gets both of them in her pouch. Today is laundry day and getting repacked as we will head for Melbourne early in the morning to put me on the plane to Adelaide. It is 3-4 hours to Melbourne by car and the flight is just an hour. If I had flown out of Albury i would have had a layover in Melbourne anyway and the ticket would have been twice the cost. The car trip would be 10 hours from Albury. This works great as Lynda and Gavin have some business in Melbourne and Lynda has to back at work on Monday. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Mary Ann Trautman matrautman blog=560654 blogger=185690 Blog Map Print Version Travel Blog » Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Albury » Blogs » The Last Days Here Tot 2.899s Tpl 0.193s cc 10 qc 45 dbt 0.0896s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 3  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

We came with a open mind as the island didnt seem to get glowing reports from a few people we spoke to but we needed to be fairly near to bangkok to keep travelling time down? Very very pleasantly surprised its lovely! Either the people we spoke to are picky or we have very low standards?.......whichever its all gravy........ After a few weeks of moving on every 2 to 3 ish days we have settled here to stop and smell the flowers. Got ourselves another moped and loving scooting around the island. In a beautiful bungalow on a resort which quite honestly is way too posh for us but hey it was cheap as its low season and what the heck weve bloody earnt it! We arrived full on clampet style all dishevelled creased and stinky! ATTRACTIVE.......... Spent the last couple of days either in the pool or scooting around the island looking for adventure......and adventure we did find! Spent a lovely morning at the most amazing elephant sanctuary DSCN2448 in the heart of the jungle here. This place had excellent morals and ethics on how their elephants live their lives. Yes they are ridden but they need that to keep a balanced mind a bored elephant is a naughty one...the ride is through the jungle in its most natural habitat. After the ride we swam and bathed a couple of them which they LOVED! All that fuss and playtime in the water helps maintain their happiness then its feedtime. The elephants did not live in a confined place instead the lived in the jungle with their mahouts which is how they have lived for centuries! Such a great place and each elephant was very happy. Sat out on the porch of our bungalow with yet another leo beer......hic!.....and a stray dog sat at my feet. She is a little love and made herself very at home with us. That is one thing i was dreading about this trip seeing dogs/cats in sorry ole states. Throughout thailand laos and cambodia we have seen very little animal sadness and no sign of rabies. Think its fair to say the majority of south east asians genuinely care for their animals DSCN2449 even the street dogs seem to be a healthy weight. The monks do an awful lot for the animals too which goes a long way. We have seen far worse in europe!

With no booking our first job was to get accommodation for the night and there were plenty of choices. After just 1 night on the island we moved hotels to a place called 15 Palms and booked for 14 nights - in retrospect maybe a little bit too long in 1 place. Our plan was to stay settled and spend Songkran Thai New Year in Ko Chang. First impressions of the island. Mountainous cooler climate in the hills less dogs cheaper laundry and loud music where we were situated on White Sands Beach. Ko Chang is the second largest island in Thailand after Phuket so it was imperative that we source a scooter and hire it for the first 7 days of our stay. Our first morning at 15 Plams we rose early to investigate the included buffet breakfast. Toast cornflakes tea and coffee - to us this was a treat the little things in life really make you happy and cornflakes certainly worked for us. The Just Reflecting Bree showing her skills as a photographer on the back of the scooter island is 30km long and 14km wide so the scooter rides proved to be quite adventurous particularly the day we decided to complete a round trip. Never follow a dotted line on a map that has no KEY. We did. We passed a small National Park looking office and took off down the small tarred path. Talk about taking the path less travelled. We followed this for about 6km to where we found a pile of concrete rubble on the creek bed that we assume was a continuation of the dotted line. After a few dead end dirt tracks and a randomly placed shrine we admitted defeat and turned back with very little fuel. The first week on the island was spent exploring the most northern waterfall Klong Chao Luam waterfall near daily book trading and another trip to the South of the island - Bang Bao and the fishermans pier to get an insight into the lives of the locals. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 8 Displayed 8 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 7 Message Mark and Bree Unleashed markandbreeunleashed Late last year 2011 we had a brain explosion of an idea to quit our long-standing jobs of 4 & 6 years and pack up all of our belongings and store away in a shed for safe keepings whilst we travel the globe.

The plan was to do a 2 hour walking tour in Jaffa. So change of clothes brush of teeth grab an orange and water and out the door I went. Not too much thoughts were running through my mind other than getting to the meeting point. And in retrospect that was a good thing. I will admit to some trepidation of being here alone and wandering the city. But with cell phone in hand Google maps I just went out the door without any reservations! The walk to Jaffa was about a mile or so but along the coastline. The Mediterranean Sea is gorgeous! I made it to the meeting point with no time to spare and off we all went on our tour. This was a free tour and came highly recommemded from all the blogs that I read. I totally recommend it! The next 2 hours were spent walking the port and the old streets/walk ways of Jaffa. It was amazing to me to think about all the people who walked this area thousands of years ago. 20180426_104409 Many interesting stories and facts were given...my head is still spinning so you will forgive me if I dont write them all down. Needless to say unbelievable! Google it! After the tour I came to realize very quickly that I had missed breakfast was was famished. Off to the St. George restaurant that I spied on my tour. They graciously set me up at the bar and I ordered the traditional kabobs. Not only was the food fantastic it was plentiful! Couldnt finish it all. And I can say hands down best hummus ever! It was so silky and smooth. After lunch I then spent the next 3 hours just winding my way around the maze of walkways. Made my wish on the Wishing Bridge with my hands on my zodiac sign looking out to the Mediterranean! Took many pictures and admired the beautiful views of the sea and Tel Aviv. You will notice quite a few pictures of doors love those! To just float around and take in the sites is a luxury to say the least. I had nowhere to be but here and I took advantage! Headed back to my hotel for a quick 20180426_105629 cat nap by the way Tel Aviv has a huge cat population there were cats everywhere! Good thing too since it rained durning that time. After my nap it was time to find dinner. I overheard my tour guide saying that Rothschild Blvd was the place to explore so off I went! Spent an hour walking up and down the Blvd before stopping in for dinner. Glass of wine champagne oyster mushroom rissoto and chocolate mousse for dessert I was set! On my way back to the hotel came upon the urban street art I had been reading about and loved discovering these works on my trek. Those pictures are in a separate entry you have got to check them out! What a day...still finding it hard to grasp that I am here! It is amazing and I am grateful to be able to experience this. To experience myself on my own... Next...Food tour at the Carmel Market and exploring the Flea Market of Jaffa...stay tuned! Be sure to scroll down and look at all the pictures. I didnt put captions on them. Maybe when I get back home. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 65 Displayed 24 « Back 1 2 3 4 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 5 Message Kristine B.

As soon as you leave the hotel it hits you. A curtain of hot air greats you and there is now way you get away from it. Even in the shade the hot air follows you. There is no colour in the buildings. They all have this grey shade over them. Of course the dust that hangs over the city is no help. The buildings all have flat roofs no bricks or tiles all flat roofs that they use for TV discs and other electric equipment so as air-conditions etc. You certainly have them here. Except in the souq. There they use these enormous fans to sort of keep a cool air going. We decided to visit the museum of Islam Art. Not that far away from us. The surrounds of this new building were superb. Water features all around it. As for the inside of it cool very high with lots of stairs. You had a nice view over the water. As for the art there were lots of old earthen ware swords and weapons. Some very nice carpets from Iran. But it was all a bit boring not at all Art centre what we expected. Back at the hotel we freshen up for at 4 p.m. there was another museum that was . Not nice and there aall about Falcons. They use a lot of Falcons to hunt but again this museum was not what it suppose to be. We saw one bird that was standing a sandpit tied to a chain. There was no show. At about 5 p.m. life starts. Taxies arrive at the souq to bring the completely covered women to this place to shop. All small shops that sell anything what you can think of. We had most of the time our meals in the souq. Good food and not expensive. Also it is nice to sit there on a sort of terrace watching the people passing by. You really see all sorts of people in different styles of clothes. The women are completely covered at least most of them. The men wear I call them pyjamas. Those long white dresses. Than the tourists. Young girls who dont wear much at all. Not many animals.All what I saw were a couple of cats. No dogs or other animals in the souq. Not many flies either probably to hot 20190617_001341 in Doha for them. That night early to bed we have to be up at an ungodly hour 4.30 a.m.That turned out to be a disaster for the wake up call suppose to be 4.30 but they called as at 1 a.m.so we went back to bed. Of course did not sleep much anymore. At 5 a.m. we were picked up by cab that took us to the airport. A 25 minutes drive. The usual problems at security but not that bad I had to go back a few times but all good in the end. This was the end of our visit to Doha. Wrong time of the year to visit but where we were close to the souq was very interesting. Next stop is Amsterdam towards Etten Leur.

Do not run. Raise your arm into the air wave it side to side and speak calmly to let her know that you are a human and will not harm her. Do not offer her food… I assume that the bear will then walk away as there are no further instructions. Fortunately the bears that I saw I observed from the deck of a passing boat and the bears were far enough away that they looked like medium sized dogs with puppies. Summer vacation in Okinawa consists of 5 weeks when the children do not have to attend school but are set about 20 hours of Homework. Teachers are entitled to 5 days summer leave plus can use as many of their 20 days annual leave as they wish. Several foreign teachers used the time to return to their home countries some of us used much of our leave to take a break and many others went to school nearly every day. What do teachers do at school during vacation time? I worked for 6 days and I did two full day workshops countless hours of pair Noh Theatre at Himeji Summer Festival and team planning lots of long chats with colleagues I hardly ever see a very few quiet hours of catching up daily two hour lunches and the pleasure of watching nearly everyone leave at knockoff time. My sister and family joined me for a precious few days in Okinawa and Himeji. We went on several fun excursions had lots of long chats and some very interesting meals. Dylan joined me at school for 4 days and was invited to return anytime. To refresh myself I went to the mainland for a busy round of social events and touristing. Toni commuted between her work in Tokyo Saitama really and each holiday stop. First stop Himeji Hyogo where I worked in 2010. It felt like coming home. I stayed in a Shirasagi apartment identical my own which was comforting and strange at the same time. The most delightful part was reconnecting with old friends picking up the threads of our four years ago relationships and continuing as if there were not years and continents in between. The highlights included a bike ride through the countryside fire lit Noh theatre under Himeji jo castle reconnecting with the spirit of Engyoji Buddhist Catching Dragonflies temple sharing thoughtful discussions about Okinawa with the Shirasagi summer classes and many warm conversations over delicious meals. Shimamoto is a tiny village between Osaka and Kyoto. The Shiomi family Aki was one of my Japanese teachers in Adelaide moved back to Japan late last year. Their home is perched on the edge of rice paddies and vegetable patches and it rings to the sounds of frogs cicadas small children and other summer tunes. For three days I played with the children got a close up view of a small community and swapped stories about the joys and difficulties of moving back to Japan. I was sad to wave them goodbye at the train station. Toni’s new work and apartment is in Saitama the nothing Prefecture – as one friend described it. A dormitory suburb of Tokyo with a population of 7 million people that has grown in the last 60 years from small scattered farming villages to one huge conglomeration of suburbia. You can see the Sky Tree from her fourth floor apartment and also experience the blistering 38-degree 90% humidity days of a Tokyo summer. My days there were spent exploring a whole ‘nother part of Ainu Puppet Theatre the city quiet green and convenient with a lot of commuting by train to get anywhere. Hokkaido big north island is where we met the bears and spent a week visiting two of the six National Parks that make up 10% of the land mass. There are active volcanoes why else would I go there! magnificent lakes beautiful forests and lush green farmland. We enjoyed the luxury of an onsen public bath with steaming underground heated water every evening and occasionally before breakfast. An unexpected treat was seeing an Ainu indigenous people of Hokkaido puppet performance about the bear god and his adventures. Hokkaido is beautiful in summer as well as winter. I am good at holidays. I feel refreshed and revitalized. I cannot recommend them enough. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 5 Displayed 5 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message bucket mouth paid to travel Wisconsin 1979 my final teaching practicum in a schoolyard thick with snow.

I remember seeing Omaha Beach Pont du Hoc and the American Cemetery and was duly thankful for all who participated in this incredibly well orchestrated invasion. This was the year I began to really see what it took for the world to come together to defeat Hitler. A few years later when planning a return trip to France Tom wanted to include Strasbourg as one of our stops because he knew that his Father had walked the streets of Strasbourg as the 3rd Division continued to push the German army back over the Rhine to Germany. We walked the streets of Strasbourg knowing we were stepping where he stepped and thought that was pretty cool. Tom had told me a few times before that his Father was at Anzio Beach in Italy during the war and his Division continued to France landing in St.Tropez then pushing Northeast for months until they were in Strasbourg towards the end of the war. Fast forward or getting back to our current trip Our boat docked in Memorial on top of Mount Sigolsheim with the Colmar pocket in the distance Strasbourg and we took a guided tour to get a better understanding of some of the areas we had walked through on our previous trip. We didnt have a lot of time there but it was nice to see Strasbourg again. John and Diana told us that they were going to join a guided tour to a WWII museum rather than visit Colmar when we got to our next stop at Breisach. Tom knowing his Father had traveled through this area thought it would be nice if we joined the tour. This particular guide was so knowledgeable and so well prepared as we boarded the bus we were given an information booklet that she put together herself with detailed maps of specific battles where they were fought and pictures of some of the Americans that performed heroic deeds during this campaign. As the bus pulled out of the parking lot Dasha our guide began what was to be probably the most enjoyable and memorable tour of our trip. Please open your books to page 3. said Dasha. We started flipping through the booklet and there staring us in the face was the emblem of the 3rd Division Colmar Pocket Toms Fathers Division. Dasha said we are going to travel to the museum in Turckheim. Then to the battlefield where your boys fought to secure what is known as the Colmar Pocket. I think my jaw dropped to the floor. I really didnt understand that this guided tour was specific to Toms Fathers Division. The 3rd Division of the army after battling in Anzio Italy and Northern Africa were then sent to France after D-Day. The war wasnt over immediately following the D-Day landing in Normandy on June 6 1944 it was merely the beginning of the end for the Germans but they were most definitely still fighting hard to keep control in France. All I personally was sure of before this tour was that the war ended at some point in 1945. How many reading this have heard of the Colmar Pocket Campaign?? Dasha pointed out that the D-Day invasion was so widely publicized most of us didnt learn anything more and thought the war just ended shortly thereafter. She went on to tell us that the Colmar Pocket Campaign was every bit as crucial as the D-Day Invasion. The battle to free Europe after Anzio View of Turekheim village in the Colmar Pocket and North Africa continued as the 3rd Division arrived in the South of France and kept fighting while pushing the Germans North and East towards Germany. They were fighting battle after battle eventually reaching what is known as the Colmar pocket. It was as the last strong hold of the German Army in France. The 3rd Division had already fought and marched hundreds of miles through France reaching Colmar near Strasbourg in what was to be the coldest Winter on record for France. Exhausted freezing and fighting without supplies the push North East put them ahead of their supplies food ammunition and medical aide they marched on battling their way toward the German border to liberate all of France. When they finally crossed the Rhine they fought the German Army on their own soil ending WWII on September 2 1945. Dasha brought us to the top of Mount Sigolsheim and Hill 616 and at the foot of the Vogues Mountain where she began to tell us the complete story of the 3rd division in what was a high loss of life battle campaign. She knew how many were in a patrol as she pointed and directed our eyes to Beautiful Ostheim 1st village liberated a small clump of forest referring to the U.S. army as your boys she told each story in incredible detail. Right here your boys pushed South then East Dasha knew the army successes and when the troops were surprised by the German army and cut down. She talked about how cold it was that when Audie Murphy the most highly decorated soldier in WWII lifted his head off the ground a small patch of scalp had adhered to the frozen ground. She knew the names of some of the heroes of the campaign and brought us exactly to points of their specific heroic act. Here the Germans were firing machines guns towards your boys who were waiting for the heavy artillery to arrive but they werent sure where to find the troop so one of the men ran crazily across the field of fire was hit several times but got to where he could point out the direction before he died. At another spot someone managed to get to the camp unharmed but needed to sit on the outside of an american tank so he could see where to send the heavy guns. Story after story was told in amazing detail everyone was absolutely riveted. She then brought us to the town of Ostheim which was the 1st town in the Colmar Pocket to be liberated by the 3rd Division and lastly to a French Memorial to Audie Murphy. It was at the edge of a forest 300 yards from the town of Holtzwihr which was still under German control. The 3rd Division was sneaking up on this town to take it back and 2 tanks were brought in. One of the tanks fell into a ditch right at the edge of the forest the other was on fire due to the Germans scoring a direct hit on it before our boys could begin their assault. 80% of the company was gone quickly and they needed to keep the Germans from advancing into the forest and taking out the heavy artillery still coming. The records show that Audie Murphy ordered his men to retreat back into the forest to hook up with the advancing US he jumped on top of the tank that was on fire and began spraying the the open field between the forest edge and the village. This went on for an hour and he only stopped when he ran out of ammunition. During his one man attack he had radio communication with the commander and was asked how close are the Germans actually to you? to which he replied Well theyre really close shall I put them on the phone? Dasha made the entire campaign come alive now we know we have truly walked in Richard B. Stones shoes as he and his Signal Corps the medics and the infantry men all with the 3rd Division pushed the Germans out of France back into Germany. We were so very fortunate to have had Dasha for our guide and it was truly amazing to stand on that hill as she told the story of the Colmar Pocket Campaign. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Tom & Roberta Stone Tom and Roberta Trips Tom and Roberta Stone........avid travelers.

Its hard to believe that when you first arrive but as you explore outwards from the centre it soon becomes clear what an extensive site it really is. Sadly the weather was a bit of a let down when we got there and also on our first day which rather curtailed our wanderings. We stayed at the Ban Boonchuguest house which sits somewhere between a B&B and a homestay. It is not the cheapest place around by a long shot but we found the landlady to be friendly and helpful providing a wonderful breakfast and there are also two really cute little dogs wandering around. We set out on foot with umbrellas close at hand and we certainly needed them at times. Our guest house was located near the historical park and away from the main backpacker area although we did venture over there for some very good meals. Our first port of call was the visitor centre which is all the way over the other side of the park! Along the way we saw some teak craftsmen at work tutted at the litter which is an eyesore in any body _MG_6695 of water and tutted even louder at the elephant rides being given on huge carriages which dig into the poor beasts thick skin. The visitor centre was quite a surprise. Inside there are modern displays giving an insight into the significance of the town and most of it is in reasonable English. It is a good place to start because you can get an overview of which places you wish to visit as otherwise the choice is a little overwhelming. On the upper floor there was a wonderful art exhibition. We had planned on buying some postcard replicas of some pieces we particularly liked but to our surprise they were not for sale. No they were free gifts for all visitors. There are far too many temples around Ayutthaya to talk about without boring you to tears. Some blogs have done a wonderful job and they also provided a handy reference for us. Have a look at Kris and Kates take on the city for more inspiration. The historical park is on an island surrounded by rivers and you can buy a pass at any of the temples which charge or just pay at each one if you only plan to _MG_6697 visit two or three. Thats what we did. The large reclining Buddha on the West side of the park was free and it was a really good temple to see even in the rain. We had planned on walking back to the iconic Wat Phra Mahathat where a Buddha head statue is trapped in the roots of a tree but the weather put paid to that idea. We had a look at a few Buddhas before flagging down a tuk tuk to take us there. Although you have to pay to enter the temple its worth the miniscule entry fee. There are lots of stupas and statues to explore as well as the overly popular head. It can get crowded but its quite easy to turn a corner and have the illusion that you are alone. The weather then scuppered any plans for further exploration and it almost had us eating a few crumbly biscuits instead of venturing out for dinner as well! The next day was better weather-wise. We rented bikes and set out to see some places beyond the island. First though we went to Wat Ratchaburana just over the road from our final visit the previous _MG_6699 day. The coachloads from Bangkok were yet to arrive and we had a great time with the place more or less to ourselves. Directly opposite are a handful of places to rent bikes from. The quality isnt great but the price is embarrassingly low so what do you expect?! On our way off the island we first stopped to see a statue of an ancient king before paying our respects at the temple of the huge cock. Now its probably not called that at all but there are so many statues of cockerels big and small that it simply seemed an apt name. There was also an enormous Buddha head in the garden too as well as some statues of mischievous monkeys outside. Once off the island we found some temples which seemed to have Italian busloads as their only other foreign visitors that day. They were beautiful places though. They were only a stop gap on our journey to see the monument to King Naresuan the Great and its nearby gleaming white temple which is breathtaking when the rain finally gives way to blistering sunshine. From there we continued out into the middle of nowhere and didnt see _MG_6712 another tourist in sight when we eventually found the statue of Queen Si Suriyothai riding into battle on an elephant. The location is fabulous set on a man-made island in the middle of a lake. It deserves more visitors but we were only too pleased to have the place to ourselves. Back on the island we continued around the edge stopping to see the French Colonial church on the south side. We also saw the women making dosas which they then wrap around a type of candy floss to make a sickly sweet treat. Luckily it was free to try as I dont imagine we would ever have bought one especially having tried one!! It was quite a tiring day especially as the bikes are not exactly high standard and the appearance of the sun raised the humidity to incredible levels. Ayutthaya was a great place to spend a few days.Of course we didnt do everything but a culinary highlight was eating in a riverside fish restaurant at a price that would shock you - in a good way! The train journey from Bangkok was also a real adventure and we took the same train line back to _MG_6716 the airport to move on to the north of Thailand. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 40 Displayed 26 « Back 1 2 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 19 Message Russ Pearce rrruss Russ and Trish are still in Spain 7 years on and loving it!

Everyone in the hotel had much the same idea so it was quite busy. I had a couple of fried eggs as well as fried rice and toasted baguette. One of my baguette slices actually ended up getting stuck in the moving toaster and lit on fire. Don’t worry – I blew it out and saved us all. It was a sunny early morning - our first of the trip – so we went up to the roof to look around. At 9am we headed down checked out and got a tuk-tuk to the airport. We were a little more than two hours early so we had to wait a little to check-in. We got in line when the check-in counter was announced but then we realized it was the counter for a Thai Airways flight to Bangkok rather than the Bangkok Airways flight both of which left at 1140am. Weird. A few minutes later our counter opened and we checked in. Security was easy and then Becky made a quick purchase at a gift Full moon ferry ride to Ko Chang shop before we settled in to wait for our flight. I couldn’t get online for some reason so I just read a bit. The flight was less than two hours but included lunch a tasty chicken and noodle dish. The flight went quickly and then we were in Bangkok airport moving towards the correct passport control and our on-going flight to Trat. I had read on the hotel’s website that we could use the lounge between flights which was pretty cool. We were able to get in and had access to some too many snacks and drinks and faster wifi. I used some of the time to finish uploading photos for the blog which was helpful. After stuffing ourselves with popcorn and sticky rice and red bean sweets we left the lounge and exchanged some money. We also had a look at the Krispy Kreme which had a long line and Halloween donuts. I was too full to think about getting one but perhaps I can be persuaded on our way back to Bangkok later this week. The flight to Trat was not full and only took an hour less actually. We were given apple turnovers as a Becky on the way to breakfast snack onboard and we decided that it was enough now – no dinner needed. Once we arrived in Trat there was a sign with just our names on it to tell us to go to the international luggage collection area since we still had to clear customs. We were the only ones who didn’t start the journey in Thailand. As soon as we got there a guy just walked up with our bags handed them over and off we went. The airport was tiny and as soon as we walked through we had the minivan people getting us to buy our ride to the hotel. It included a minivan driving us to the ferry the ferry to Koh Chang and then the minibus driving us to the hotel. We bought the return as well as it was slightly cheaper and there was no other way to really do it. Quite pricey compared to Laos but not expensive per se. It seemed we waited ages for the ferry to arrive but the ferry ride itself couldn’t have been longer than twenty minutes. The full moon was out and reflecting off the water which was quite pretty. They hold the last A spicy breakfast ferry to coincide with the last flight in case the flight is late but I think we were on the penultimate ferry so we arrived a little earlier. The hotel Serenity is owned by our friend and colleague Marcus’s stepbrother. Marcus’s mom Julie and his stepfather Keith are here for the next six months and Keith met us when we arrived and got us set-up in our room. It appears to be a place more for couples so we have one large bed that we are sharing. Once we got settled in we walked around to see what we could see in the dark – not much – but we got a little feel for the place. There is an infinity pool and a nice little beach. We sat in the bar area looking out to sea where Becky enjoyed a pint of beer. I was overhydrated from the day I felt. It was a long travel day but it was good to have arrived. October 15 – We woke up today a little after 7am and relaxed for quite a while. We sat in front of the villa having a tea/coffee and finally made our way to Serenity Resort breakfast around 10am. We both decided to go for a spicy Thai chicken and basil dish Pad Krapow I think. My it was spicy. And it made me hiccup. A lot. And it was only medium. By the time I was done I almost took the leftover milk from Becky’s coffee and scarfed it down to ease the pain. It was hard to think of anything but the burn. Julie came over around that time and introduced herself and I noticed the burn start to fade. Back in the room later I rinsed my face with water and noticed my face felt funny. I think the spice that was around my mouth spread to nearby parts of my face so I washed my lips with soap. Better. Phew. Once we finally got ourselves together to get out for the day it was around noon. We took a walk on the very short beach and then set up under an umbrella. We spent the afternoon reading swimming in the pool swimming in the incredibly shallow sea and even snoozing a little. It was a good beginning to relaxing. Late in the afternoon I took a short walk along the main Serenity Resort road to see if there were other food opportunities nearby. There are a couple of cheap Asian eateries with tables set up close to the road. They are much cheaper than the hotel though in western standards the hotel is not expensive and we might try to get there for a lunch or two. After my walk I took another quick dip in the pool then a shower before we headed to dinner. I had Pad Thai and Becky had a green curry. There was a lot of heat lightning and I wasn’t sure if it would turn into a storm or not. It did get very windy but I don’t think it did rain in the end. We headed back to the room around 830pm and I couldn’t get the internet to show me anything other than my email or the New York Times so I spent most of my time reading. October 16 – We had an earlier start this morning getting to breakfast about 9am. I decided on fried rice to eat Thai food for as long as possible. After breakfast we asked about visiting the waterfall that Steve told us about yesterday and we Crab agreed on leaving at 10am. I had to get changed and put on some sunscreen and then we met Keith who drove us the five minutes it took to the drop-off. You can also drive up to the waterfall but we wanted to have a bit of a walk as well. It took 20 minutes to get to the first part of the falls and we spent another 10 minutes climbing a bit further up. It was warm and we were sweaty so we found a nice pool there to take a dip in. We stayed in for about 45 minutes and then dried off to head back to the pick-up spot. Steve arrived to pick us up exactly when we got there so that was some good timing. Back at the resort we ran into Julie outside of her bungalow and we agreed to meet her for a chat ten minutes later at the restaurant. Our room was being cleaned so we headed there first to wait for her. We sat and chatted with her for about an hour and then walked next door to the local restaurant for a late lunch. I had fried noodles with pork Along our walk and Becky had fried rice with pork. Yummy as always. After lunch we went to the pool. Before we got in I asked Keith about the villas close to the pool and he took us inside of one to show us around. They built the villas and sold them but they manage the rentals. They have a terraced roof with a jazuzzi two bedrooms and a kitchen. An ever so slight upgrade from our one room bungalow. Luckily we were walking out of the bungalow just as the people who were renting it were arriving. Phew. It’s actually starting to fill up here a bit. When we arrived there was just another couple staying and a small group of Germans who left the next morning. Yesterday a woman arrived and today a couple of families and another couple arrived. Our nearly private resort no longer. We swam a little and read a little and around 445pm we decided to take a kayak out. Usually the water is still but as the tide changes around this time it gets a little choppy. Easier to use the kayak than try paddleboarding in those conditions for sure. We had a nice Eastern reef egret little paddle and then headed back to the room for showers and some tea/coffee. As we sat outside my mom called and we had a chat before the internet went haywire. Then it was almost 8pm and we headed for food. We both got fried noodles – my second for the day. But they are so good here and I love the flat noodles in these dishes. We left a little after 9pm when we remembered that it was closing time. I think we could have stayed there but the guys needed to be able to officially close up for the night. Another good day done. October 17 – Sleep last night was not as good for some reason and we were awake by 630 and up and moving by 7am. For breakfast we both had an omelet with cheese ham and veggies but we struggled to understand when the waiter said it included vegetables. Neither of us could work out the word he was saying and both felt bad later but the waiter was awesome and didn’t seem to mind. He just found the word elsewhere in our menu and showed us. As we waited for the P1760907 food to come out I took tons of photos of a bug I was obsessed with at breakfast yesterday and again today. He had his place would fly off like a rocket but always come back to the same spot. Great photo subject. After breakfast we headed to the pool and spent about an hour lying out and reading before Julie came to tell us that Keith would be back soon to take us to the Sa-Lak-Phet Mangrove Forest boardwalk. He actually came up as we were talking so we headed to the room to get ready and off we went. It was a short drive there and we started to walk the newly refinished boardwalk and then Keith caught us up later catching me taking several pictures of crabs. He couldn’t quite believe that they were that interesting but I do like me some crabs. On the way back to Serenity we stopped at a fruit plantation/diner/cooking school. Keith walked us around the grounds and then treated us to a coconut shake and some papaya. It was quite refreshing and enough to tide us over until dinner. We spent the afternoon at the pool again and Scenery I had a swim in the sea and then again in the pool with Becky. It was a pretty cloudy day and by 4pm we called it quits. When we went for dinner Keith offered us a complimentary cocktail and I chose a mocktail called Sweet Cloud which is essentially a chocolate milk with whipped cream. Not what everyone gets but it was great. I’d been eyeing it up for days and it felt like having dessert before dinner. We invited Keith and Julie to sit with us and then both came and had dinner with us which was very nice. I almost tried a new dish tonight but chose pad thai because I always enjoy it. Becky got her ginger chicken. We spent a couple of hours chatting and finally said good night just before 9pm. when we headed back to do some packing before bed. Sad to leave tomorrow but it’s been a really nice visit in Ko Chang.

We spotted Mount Agung on Bali the crater lake of Mount Ijen and Mount Merapi on Java. There were no clouds no wind just sunshine when we touched down in Kuala Lumpur at 10 am. It was the 6th or 7th - we lost the overview time touching down in our favourite city in Asia - but never before it was that smooth. Normally due to weather conditions rains and thunderstorms touching down in Kuala Lumpur has a bit of a rollercoaster feeling. But this time perfectly calm. We could exchange our remaining indonesia rupiahs in malaysian ringits bought some fresh fruits for breakfast at a little store and went down on the ground floor to catch the bus to KL Sentral. It is by far the cheapest options to go to town. Depending on the traffic it takes a bit more than 1 hour but the buses are convenient. So we had breakfast on the bus slept a bit and we were back in KL Sentral. From here we took the monorail. Our Airbnb appartment was in Bukit Bintang. So we got of the monorail at Raja Chulan Station from Sri Ranganath Temple in Kajang - attending evening prayers where it was a 5 minute walk to our appartment. Luckily we could already check in. We had a nice clean private appartment in the Ramada Suites Complex. We love this system. They have mailboxes for the AirBnB guests. You get a code pick up your key from the mailbox and go to the room. super efficient and hassle free. Great! Our appartment was really cool. Great views over the city unfortunately to the wrong side - so no KL Tower or Petronas Tower views for us clean spacious nicely decorated including a kitchen a washing machine a bathroom and a nice little balcony. The bed was big and comfy. So we settled down and happily took use of the much needed washing machine. We even had a hairdryer and worked on our phone short reminder after our camera also both our phones enjoyed a dip in the ocean and were dead. And after 1 hour of carefully dryblowing and putting underneath the aircon the first phone showed signs of life to put the story short - we could both safe our phones within 1 day with the help of the aircon. What a relief! But we had to in front of Lord Murugan in the Batu Caves hurry up. Our 5 days in Kuala Lumpur were fully packed - this was not holiday any more. We had to work and get some really important things done which we had planned beforehand. First thing was that already at 2 pm Markus had a long appointment with the dentist. So we got a grab car still love this system it is so quick and easy and hassle free and after 20 minutes we arrived at the dentist. We were welcomed and sat down. While Markus was getting 4 teeth done !!! I was comfortably enjoying my time in the waiting area which was more a comfy living room with views into a tropical garden hpt tea and coffee and even vegan cookies. Time to read and enjoy for me. But also Markus came out happy without pain and nicely restored teeth. Even the bill did not hurt as much as it normally does in Switzerland. So we were happy and planned with the dentist to come back in about 2 years. Well we see how things are going - but if we can make it we will surely go back here. We can really recommend Dentalpro in Kuala Lumpur! delicious indian paper dosa Great treatment professional safe clean and super modern - and a very polite staff. Next thing was to pick up my glasses which I had ordered 4 weeks ago. So we took another grab car to get to Bangsar Village. There we spotted a vegan ice and cake café. Well important things first. We had a nice hot coffee in the freezing cold mall never get it why malaysian malls are so freezing cold vegan chocolate cake and in the end some ice cream. Yummy. Then I got my new glasses and Markus finally ended up having an eye test as well and ordered some glasses for himself. They would not be ready in the time we are in KL as the glasses are a bit special. But what a great service - they offered us to send everything to Switzerland for a really small fee and it worked out perfectly fine. So also here great service high quality glasses and professional eye tests also icare in Bangsar Village can only be recommended. After a short stop in the supermarket of the mall love it it has so many great products we walked to Little India which is 10 Bali seen from the plane on our way from Lombok to Kuala Lumpur minutes away. There we bought some things for our little hindu temple at home and also stocked up with Himalaya Products. These ayurvedic products like lotion shampoo tooth paste are great but super expensive and hard to get in Switzerland. Here you get it all for less than a third of the price. Heavily loaded it was time for a nice indian dinner. We enjoyed some great paper dosa and veggie curry in one of the vegetarian restaurants. How do we love these indian restaurants in Malaysia! We could go there for breakfast lunch and dinner. Most of them have great quality are clean food is safe and the taste is out of this world. We ended a fantastic dinner with chai tea before we took the monorail back home. There we just sat on our balcony overlooking the crazy nightlife in nearby Changkat Road. But as soon as we closed the door to the balcony the noise stayed outside - the great advantage of living in the 23rd floor. After a very long day we got up at 4 am to catch the flight to KL we slept like babies and had a slow start into the next waiting at the dentist for the treatment day. We made our own breakfast in our kitchen put on another washing machine and worked a little bit. Great feeling to have everything clean again emails checked orders done projects for the new year on the go appointment with a new employee fixed. Life of self employed on the road. Around midday we made our way to Bukit Nanas. Never ever before did we walk around this forest reserve in the heart of the city. Bad luck for us since a couple of days you have to pay an entrance fee it was free before. Anyway the canopy walk was nice the forest and the birds were a pleasant change from the city and we enjoyed some fresh air before we headed to the area around Masjid Jamek. There we know 2 very nice indian vegetarian restaurants - time for lunch. This time we went to the Bhakti Woodlands and had a fantastic vegan thali with a chai in the end of course. Later we went to Little India there are 2 Little Indias in KL - one around KL Sentral in Bricksfield where we went the day before and one on the other side of the Klang river vegan treats at Bangsar Village close to Masjid Jamek. To get there we walked along a typical malaysian market which was very entertaining. In Little India again it was time for shopping this time clothes before we headed back home where we quickly freshened up. Because for sunset we had planned another thing we had only done once before in KL. We wanted to enjoy sunset on a rooftop. 3 years ago we had a fantastic time on the rooftop of Traders close to the Petronas Towers. This time we had decided to pay the Helipad a visit. This is a helicopter platform close to the monorail station of Raja Chulan. Early evening it transforms into a bar. The entrance fee is 50 Ringgit per person which includes 1 drink. It is very famous. And we loved it. The views are just ensane - and well you are on a rooftop on a helicopter plattform with only a cord protecting you from falling down. It is such a cool and great atmosphere with a mixture of businessmen tourists from all over the world and locals - from hippies to brokers. Around 8 pm unfortunately it started raining and we had to go down. So we Markus having his eyes tested spontanously decided to visit the Berjaya Mall. We have never been there - and the only reason we went was that we wanted to see the rollercoaster inside the mall. It is insane! Well we are not fans of big malls we prefer the smaller malls like in Bangsar but to see something like this once is a must. By foot we walked back via the Alor Night Food Market where we had a delicious fresh sugar cane juice. But as vegans passing through this street it is not really fun - and there is not a lot you can eat either. So we went back to our appartment quickly and enjoyed a homemade vegan dinner with lots of fresh fruit there. Unfortunately in the apartment complex it is not allowed to eat durian which we like and mangosteen which we are crazy for - the best fruit in the world. So we sticked to papaya mango snake fruit and pitaya - not bad anyway. Next morning same routine breakfast working cleaning the apartment a bit and then we were of by foot to Chinatown. Well honestly we do not like Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur. But we wanted to Bricksfield - Little India visit the famous Sri Mahamariamman Temple. And this hindu temple is in the middle of Chinatown. As it was sunday late morning the streets were still quiet. We arrived at the temple just in time to do the parikrama walking 3 times clockwise around the temple to pay respect and then the sunday prayers started. So happily we could attempt this service in the temple. It was annoying that so many tourists were running around filming the ceremony. I mean of course tourists can take pictures and film but shouldnt we all do it in a descrete way! Even Markus and I were really disturbed. Prayers were really nice and we sat down to meditate a bit afterwards. The temple is very nice with a huge south indian gopuram entrance tower. So we were really happy to finally have visited it. After a short break for an excellent vegan capuccino in the cafe of the travellodge close by great cafe and superbe coffee with alternative milk! we walked along the Klang River. This part is newly renovated and really beautiful. We walked back to the apartment and got freshened up for the evening. We had planned to meet a friend Markus working in our appartment at night that night and go together to a very special temple. Unfortunately she could not join us as a family member was in hospital and she had to take care of the person. So we took the train to Kajang and went to the temple on our own. 3 years ago we came here for a darshan personal blessing with our spiritual master Paramahamsa Vishwananda. It was a very special darshan for us and he told us something very important which is a bit too private to share here -. Anyway since then this place this temple is really special for us and we were so excited to come back. The main priest recognised us and we had a short talk to him before the evening prayers started. We enjoyed it very much to be back in this special temple. Much too fast the prayers were over. It was a bit tricky to find a grab again which could bring us from the temple to the train station. But finally we managed and got back home safely. We did not feel like going out that night but wanted to tressure our time in the temple with some quiet time in the our lovely appartment apartment. After a quiet evening and a long and relaxing night we got up late. After breakfast we had to pack all our stuff. It was our last day in KL already. We left the luggage at the reception and hopped on the monorail to KL Sentral from where we took a train to the Batu Caves. We had been there many years ago but we felt like coming back. We love south indian temples and there are many in Malaysia - so we wanted to have as much time in the temples as possible. To get to the Batu Caves is easy and straight forward. Once there we decided to first visit a new cave with an amazing exhibition. With big statues the life of Rama was displayed. It was beautifully made and greatly explained and we enjoyed it a lot. The best no visitors here! We nearly had the huge cave for ourselves. Close by Batu Caves was flooded with tourists. Nonetheless we climbed the stairs and went to the temple. Unfortunately the main temple was closed for the next 4 hours. So luck was not on our side here. But it did not matter. We went to view from our appartment at night some smaller temples and finally went back to town. It was beautiful anyway and always worth a visit. Back in town we went to the Mimph House a vegan eco restaurant near Raja Chulan monorail. It was difficult to find the restaurant in a mall but food was amazing. They have typical malaysian dishes purely vegan. So we had lakhsa an interesting desert and some amazing side dishes. All fresh and organic - really nice and prices are fair. But no visit to KL is complete without a final stroll around the KLCC park and a glimpse of the Petronas Towers which are simply impressive. And much too fast our trip to Asia had come to an end. We went back to get our luggage and got a grab to the airport. Our flight was at 2 am in the morning. After a pleasant Emirates flight to Dubai we arrived at 5 am deadly tired in Dubai where we hang around for 7 hours till our connecting flight to Istanbul. In Istanbul we had one more night which was pretty uneventful. We had a terrible but cheap place to sleep close to the airport. All we did was breakfast time struggeling with icy temperatures below 0 degress C at night and drizzeling rain warming us up in a coffee shop having dinner having a short night and then back to the airport again. Finally we landed back in Switzerland. And little did we know at that time what a chaotic year was lying ahead of us. Maybe that was our last big trip for a long time - the corona virus has turned our lifes like many other lifes upside down. Being self employed we are working hard to survive with our business so who knows when travelling will be possible again how it will be and when we will have enough funds. We just hope that travellers and of course all people in general will not be expsoed to compulsary vaccinations - something we are completely against. Maybe our next blog will be from our time at home....Stay all safe and healthy! « Previous Entry Additional photos below Photos 59 Displayed 32 « Back 1 2 3 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 36 Message Nina+Markus holamundo Hola mundo! - We are Nina and Markus.

We arrive in Paris at 6.40 am and take the airport shuttle to Gare de Nord railway station. The railway station is large and there are soldiers armed with machine guns roaming the station. Here we find the luggage storage area where we leave our bags in a locker before catching a train to Amiens. One thing we notice is that there a lot of people with dogs boarding trains and are impressed that the french are pet firendly. At Amiens we find out from the information booth outside the station how to get to Villers Bretonneux. We have lunch while we are waiting for the train then head to Villiers. In the First World War on 24 April 1918 the small town of Villers-Bretonneux was the site of the worlds first battle between two tank forces three British Mark IVs against three German A7Vs. The Germans took the town but that night and the next day it was recaptured by 4th and 5th Division of the AIF at a cost of over twelve hundred Australian lives. The people of Villers-Bretonneux remain indebted to Australia for this feat. The towns mayor spoke of the Australian troops on 14 July 1919 when unveiling a memorial in their honour The Australian War Memorial in France is located in Villers-Bretonneux and in front of it lie the graves of over 770 Australian soldiers as well as those of other British Empire soldiers involved in the campaign. The school in Villers-Bretonneux was rebuilt using donations from school children of Victoria Australia many of whom had relatives perish in the towns liberation and above every blackboard is the inscription Noublions jamais lAustralie Never forget Australia. The annual ANZAC Day ceremony is held at this village on Anzac Day 25 April each year. Traditionally Australian commemorations have focussed on Gallipoli. We walked through the town to the Memorial at the local school. After looking through the school we walked through the village to the top of the hill and could see the War Memorial in the dstance but decided it was too far to walk. There were no taxis or buses so walking was the only option. We had hoped to go to Bullecourte for the ANZAC Day service which was to be held at 3 pm but after asking the locals we discovered it was 70 klms away. With no transport options we headed back to the railway station to find it abandoned and could not find anyone to tell us when the next train was. We went back to the scholl and asked them to ring a taxi. The nearest taxi was at Amiens about 50 klms away. When we arrive in Amiens we walk to the Notre Dame Basillica which we could see earlier from the railway station. The basillica is impressive and we are amazed that it withstood the war without any serious damage. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens French Cathédrale Notre-Dame dAmiens or simply Amiens Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral and seat of the Bishop of Amiens currently Jean-Luc Bouilleret. It is situated on a slight ridge overlooking the River Somme in the administrative capital of the Picardy region of France some 120 km north of Paris. The cathedral is the tallest complete cathedral in France its stone-vaulted nave reaching a height of 42.30 m surpassed only by the incomplete Beauvais Cathedral. It also has the greatest interior volume of any French cathedral estimated at 200000 m³. The cathedral was built between 1220 and c.1270 and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981. Although it has lost most of its original stained glass Amiens Cathedral is renowned for the quality and quantity of early 13th century Gothic sculpture in the main west facade and the south transept portal and a large quantity of polychrome sculpture from later periods inside the building. Amiens cathedral contains the largest medieval interior in Western Europe supported by 126 pillars. Both the nave and the chancel are vast but extremely light with considerable amounts of stained glass surviving despite the depredations of war. The ambulatory surrounding the choir is richly decorated with polychrome sculpture and flanked by numerous chapels. One of the most sumptuous is the Drapers chapel. The cloth industry was the most dynamic component of the medieval economy especially in northern France and the cloth merchants were keen to display their wealth and civic pride. Another striking chapel is dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury a 13th century dedication that complements the cathedrals own very full list of martyrs. The interior contains works of art and decoration from every period since the building of the cathedral. We leave Amiens and head back to Paris where we collect our luggage from the storage area and find our way through winding tunnels and turnstiles to the train to Grenelle where our apartment is. We arrive at the apartment early in the evening. The apartment is surrounded by shops and restaurants so we go down to a local restaurant for tea. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Cheryl Kirby UK and Europe 2011 Joined June 7th 2011 Trips 1 Last Login June 23rd 2011 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 4 Guestbook 0 Photos 106 Forum Posts 0 blog=618087 blogger=201241 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=618087 blogger=201241 Advertisement Brief history of France Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II France suffered extensive losses in its empire wealth manpower and rank as a dominant nation-state.

Someone hd egged our truck overnight I dont know how many eggs but it was well done! DAY 373 I awoke with terrible cramp in my calf muscle I rubbed it for ages before it calmed down and went back to normal. I had a glass of water beside me it was a warm night so I drank it down with ease and eventually went back to sleep. I knew Andy had already got out of bed it was daylight already but I was tired so carried on sleeping we had a late night last night and after all that travelling a small lie in was deserved. I finally succumbed to the daylight at 7.30 and got up. I remembered that Andy told me when he went out to the truck this morning he noticed that overnight someone had egged” it the egg was spattered over the rear the drivers window and wing mirror and all across the bonnet. Andy was having a shower and shave he had been sat outside on the veranda enjoying a cup of tea and watching the beautiful view over the back of Bathurst. Clayton lee and Marilyn’s son is also up and about he makes a cup of tea for me. I eventually join Clayton and Andy on Harvest Time at Woodstock the veranda followed closely by Lee and Marilyn. We sit and chat admire the stunning view over a breakfast of tea and toast but time again moved on and we were needing to hit the road Andy wanted to be away by 10.00 although we have not got so far to travel today we still have a good four hours drive ahead of us and we don’t want to arrive late at Woodstock. Just before we leave Bathurst Lee spends 10 minutes washing the egg off for us otherwise once the sun heats up we will have a baked on omelette. We say our goodbyes and head off pleased that we were able to see Lee and Marilyn if only very briefly but Woodstock beckons and we must go. It is 10.00 and we are heading out of Bathurst toward Cowra a fairly uneventful journey we grab a coffee as we drive through Young and pick up the Olympic Way toward Cootamundra we are now taking some country roads in true KangarooJack style we had a small bet on what time we would arrive at Woodstock. Neither of us had taken this road before and we Dumping the Grain Andy drives the Chaser Bin. have no idea how long it would take so I said it would be 2.02 pm and Andy went for 1.55pm. We were soon in Bethungra and turning off for Nangus this bit was going to be guess work because the map can get a bit vague on some of these lesser known tracks and if there is no signpost it is all guess work. We pass one turning but I was not sure so we carried on then another turning that said Nangus so I knew that we were good. Then at the end of the road we took the turning for Nangus and then realised that we should have turned right instead of left Andy reckoned that I threw him a bum steer in a bid to win our little game. However we turned around and in no time at all Woodstock came into sight. Instead of the parched landscape that we had seen back in February this year we are now driving past fields of wheat canola and triticale the colour is beautiful and the texture of the landscape looks like velvet. We turn for Woodstock and drive down the familiar dusty lane The Header or Combine Harvester as we know it. remembering how last time it all looked very strange and different than what we were used to but this time there is that nice sense of familiarity. We pull up under the Red Flowering Gum tree just outside the house the engine is off and it is 2.00 we agree that we should call our little bet a draw we were both very close to the time and considering I directed Andy to go left when we realised we should have gone right then I thought it was the fair thing to do. We knew that everybody would be out it is a busy time here so we wandered up to the house anyway and surprisingly there was someone inside. Bree introduced herself to us she is here with James Helen and Roberts Son everyone is apparently out and about concentrating on the harvest. James and Bree are going back to Canberra today but James is obviously still out working. One of the first things that I notice is the significant amount of flies around I don’t know which type of fly but they are not the black variety but small and light brown they don’t Dumping the Grain into the chaser bin. bite apparently but they are everywhere I notice a large spot lamp on the lawn with a fly zapper next to it I now suspect there must be a problem the flies are all over the windows and the mosquito screens. Eventually James reappears and suggests to Andy that he should give him a training session Andy agrees but of course only a training session then he will be right back I knew that would be the last I saw of him until about 9.30. In the meantime Helen reappears it is great to see Helen she already tells me that we should make ourselves at home and we are in Susan’s bedroom so I start to get organised. A phone call comes in and Helen is receiving instructions take some water and something to eat out to Andy as he only expected to be out there to do a bit of training and all of a sudden he just carries on and drives the tractor with chaser bin behind so the tractor chases the header Combine Harvester so instead of stopping everything to unload they unload as they go so the header just keeps cutting the In the Mirror crop and time is not wasted. I am despatched with Helens car the water and some fruit for Andy I know I need to drive about 12 kilometres to a place called Yileena aborigina for Dream Come True I roughly know where it is so off I go but I do drive up and down the lane a couple of times to get the right turning it felt like ages before I came down the hill and could see exactly what I was looking for. I pulled up in the lane I was driving a normal 2 wheel drive car so was unable to take the car into the field I see Robert who tells me where I need to go to find Andy if I want to join in I can sit in the header as there is 2 seats so I would have to go and sit with Jason I go up and wait by the lorry in the field a tractor and trailer soon appears alongside the lorry. All I can see in the cab is Andy’s smiley face he seems to be enjoying the challenge. Andy persuades me to go and sit in The Comb the header while Jason cuts the rest of the paddock I am not too keen for some reason this farm machinery I find quite scary it is all quite huge. Jason stops and I jump in well ok I actually climb in and we are away Jason instructs Andy over the UHF where he needs to be and when in order for Jason to empty the header into the chaser bin. Jason explains how the header works it is amazing really this thing is run on computers and GPS. The GPS tells the header exactly where to go you can see on the screen an image of the paddock that is being cut and you can see what has been cut and what has not you can even tell how much in weight has been collected in a day. It feels really weird to be sat up so high in this huge monster of a machine it turns round in the field on a sixpence Jason also shows me the comb that cuts the crop I can see Andy on the hill waiting for the call from Jason to say that he can collect the grain soon Jason he is alongside us again the grain from the header is dropped into the chaser bin not an easy roll by any account as the bin has to match the speed of the header so that the grain goes into the bin and not back on the field. Once this paddock is finished I jump out of the header the guys all move to a different paddock and I jump back in Helens car and head back to the farm where a nice chilled glass of white awaits my attention. I have a shower and change into clean clothes Robert appears long before Andy does but at 9.00 Andy appears ready for dinner. Helen has the lamp alight on the front lawn there are lots of flies buzzing around in the light which means that there are fewer coming into the house there are some but they are congregating around the overhead lights I wonder how long they will hang around. It has been a very long day for us both but Andy did not expect to go straight into work it has been a touch day for him he has done most of the driving The Chaser Awaits this morning so he is exhausted at 10.00 we all retire but no sooner than we jump into bed the dogs start barking but they pale into insignificance as tiredness takes over. Andy hopes for a straightforward day tomorrow to carry out his task with the chaser bin however as we know things never work out quite the way you expect so tune in tomorrow for another exciting day on our adventure. Goodnight. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 14 Displayed 14 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 29 Message The Ts kangaroojack Back in the November of 2008 we embarked on an adventure that would take us out of everything that we were so familiar with a comfortable life in the UK friends family and the English countryside.

Argh! I refuse to take and post photos of these monstrosities as I simply hate them. Before finishing up my job in Melbourne a colleague asked whether we would be doing the big things on our trip. I replied yes thinking she meant the Sydney Opera House and Ayers Rock etc! Apparently there is a whole website dedicated to The Big Things… Ah well I might come round to it one day but for now I think it represents the epitome of tackiness. The shrimp aside Ballina is lovely and quite peaceful. We arrived around lunchtime so stopped in a park to prepare some food when we saw a couple of tandem parachutists come into land across the road. That was our friend Kim with whom we were going to meet up later on! It was great catching with him and Grace over a beer and nibbles and in the evening we drove out to Boulder Beach to check out the surf. We made good use of Ballina’s excellent cycle paths but they do need to install some bicycle racks! and explored the town and the beaches. When passing a campervan sales company we couldn’t resist popping in and having a look in the name of research and seeking inspiration of course and came out with a determined resolution to win the lottery. With a price tag of $110k my favourite was a Fiat Ducato Horizon Banksia! On our second night in Ballina merrily parked in car park by the inlet we had a pretty narrow escape. Dean got up early and spotted a ranger plastering warning tickets on other vans and improvised by grabbing his fishing rod and pretending he had just driven up to go fishing. Apparently you get one warning ticket and the next time you’re fined $120. I still fail to see what’s actually so criminal about sleeping in your vehicle…!! After a hot shower and lunch at Kim and Grace’s place thanks guys! Grace you are my sushi inspiration! it was time to hit the road again. It seemed more sensible to hit busy Byron Bay in the morning rather than the evening so we only drove as far as Lennox Head a beautiful low key village where we went for a nice coastal walk and are now chilling out near the beach. People laugh – and so do we – when we tell them that we’ve been on the road for three months as we haven’t made it very far in that time! It’s lovely taking our time though and we’ve decided that this trip will take as long as it needs to. We’ll need to start working around the end of June and will make sure we find a nice spot for that. For now we’re enjoying being nomads and we’re relishing the wonderful sunny weather – it’s just perfect so long may it last! I have also bought myself a little ultrasonic gadget along with antihistamines and anesthetic gel! to ward off the pesky mozzies. They’re the ones who started it and I am ready for a war!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Jackie & Dean TeamJD We are two skydivers and yogis who love to travel explore and experience new things.

Harkitsin Kanazawaa mutta säätiedot paikassa näyttivät melko surkeilta. Kyoto olisi yksi vaihtoehto vaikka kerran aikaisemmin lyhyesti olinkin siellä käynyt. Shikokun saarelle en ollut vielä ehtinyt joten päätin matkustaa Takamatsuun. Matkan varrella olisi toki vielä mahdollista muuttaa mieltä. Pakkasin tavarani ihmetellen mahtuvatko eilen ostamani paidat vielä samaan 28 litran reppuuni mutta ihme kyllä kaikki edelleen sopi. Valuuttaa oli tarve vaihtaa lisää ja halusin myös vielä käydä yhdessä levykaupassa joten otin junan Shibuyaan. Pankin valuutanvaihtotiski oli juuri avautunut joten tässä ei mennyt aikaa hukkaan. Kurssi oli paras tähän mennessä reissua eurolla sai 136.67 jeniä. Levykauppa näkyi jo kaukaa kyseessä oli mahdollisesti Japanin ehkä koko maailman suurin Tower Recordsin myymälä. Nyt löysin kaikki kolme levyä joita vielä etsin. Hinta oli kohtuullinen joten ostoon. Sain nämäkin mahtumaan melko täyteen reppuuni. Jatkoin Yamanote junalla Shinagawan asemalle miettien taasko alkaa nukuttaa luotijunassa. Ostin lounasta mukaan sitten laiturille ihmettelemään mitä junia on lähdössä ja mihin aikaan. Kodama juna 5 min kuluttua mutta Hikari super express 10 min kuluttua joka sopi paremmin koska tiesin että Kodama matkalla kuitenkin ohitetaan. Vaunussa 1 oli hyvin tilaa ja söin lounaaksi ostamani lohileivän. Ensimmäinen etappi siis Hikari junan pääteasemalle IMG_2604 Takamatsu Castle in Tamamo Park Osakaan ja siellä vaihto seuraavaan. Kirjoitin blogia ja katsoin maisemia. Fuji vuoren huippu oli jälleen pilvien peittämä vaikka keli muuten kirkas olikin. Sain kuitenkin otettua jonkinlaisen kuvan vuoresta. Sitten alkoi nukuttaa kuten ennakoin. Nagoyan ja Kyoton välissä torkuinkin hiukan mutta sitten sain itseni taas hereille ennen Osakaan saapumista. Perillä Osakassa katsoin seuraavia lähteviä junia ja 20 minuutin päästä lahti Sakura joka ei ennen Okayamaa turhaan pysähdellyt kuin Kobessa matkan varrella. Parasta siis olisi pysytellä hereillä koska juna jatkaisi aina Kagoshimaan joten ostin evääksi aisteja terävöittävän oluen. Okayaman asemalla taas katsomaan koska juna Takamatsuun lähtee ja odotusta oli siedettävat 20 min. Varasin paikkalipun joka jälleen osoittautui oikeaksi liikkeeksi vaikka vain käytäväpaikka olikin vapaana unreserved vaunujen ollessa melko täysiä. Nousin junaan ja vaunu olikin itse asiassa 1. luokan. Muissa ei ollut numeroituja paikkoja. Melkoinen silta kulki saarelta toiselle Japanin sisämeren yli jonka juna ylitti matkalla. Tämä viimeinen etappi oli vain hiukan alle tunnin joten perillä Takamatsussa olin kuudelta. Tokiosta Shinkansen asemalta noin viisi tuntia koko matkaan odotuksineen melko nopeaa sanoisin. Takamatsun aseman edessä oli turisti-info joka opaskirjani mukaan meni kiinni tasan kuudelta ja ovessa luki aivan samaa. Kello oli noin kolmea minuuttia yli kuuden kun sinne ehdin mutta IMG_2607 Castle moat ovi oli kuitenkin auki ja porukkaa sisällä. Marssin siis sisään ja en tiedä mitä toimituksia paikalliset siellä setvivät mutta sain kuitenkin palvelua. En oikeastaan muuta kaivannut kuin kaupungin kartan johon on merkitty nähtävyydet mutta infon avulias setä vielä kysyi missä hotellissa majoitun. Kerroin etsiväni vasta majoitusta ja hän heti alkoi suositella kuulemma omaa hotelliansa joten mahtoiko olla omistaja vai manageri. Raapusti huoneen hinnankin karttaan ja se oli hyvin kohtuullinen 5000 jeniä. Kävelin katsomaan paikkaa tosin ensin hiukan katua väärään suuntaan löytäen paikan kuitenkin. Kysyin vastaanottotiskiltä vapaata huonetta ja taskulaskimeen naputeltiin näkyviin hinta 5250 jeniä. Pari euroa enemmän kuin infossa mainostettu joten kaivoin kartan esiin ja näytin raapustuksen. Respa ilmeisesti tunnisti pomonsa kuittauksen ja hinta tippui saman tien tuohon tasan viiteen tonniin. Huone olikin sitten erittäin asiallinen ei kellarissa vaan kolmannessa kerroksessa. Hinta ja laatu kohtasivat erittäin hyvin heti kun oltiin hiukan Tokiota pienemmässä kaupungissa. Kun lähdin ulos illallista etsimään hotellin neuvonut herra olikin vastaanotossa paperitöiden kimpussa. Kävelin alueelle josta turistiesitteen mukaan ravintoloita löytyisi. Matkan varrella oli melkoisen kokoinen shopping arcade eli katettuja kävelykatuja varmasti usean kilometrin verran. Etsin paikkaa jonka tarjoaman menun käsitän kuvista tai sitten englanninkielistä ruokalistaa. Jälkimmäinen toteutui ja menusta löytyi Shodoshima Island Hashed Beef -annos. IMG_2626 Ritsurin Park Se sisälsi lihasuikaleita sipulia ja oikein hyvän kastikkeen sekä riisiä ja salaatin. Maistui erittäin hyvin. Ruokailtuani lähdin etsimään pubia jossa kumota pari tuoppia. Ensimmäinen lupaavan näköinen ei oikein toiminut. Menin sisään ja asiakkaita ei ollut tiskin takana kuitenkin nainen hoitamassa baaria. Katselin ettei oluthanoja näy mutta pullotavarakin olisi käynyt. Baarimikko jotain kovasti yritti selittää mutta en yhtään mitään ymmärtänyt. Hänkään ei tainnut ymmärtää että olisin vain juotavaa ollut vailla. Tilanne ei edennyt tuosta mihinkään joten kohteliaasti poistuin. Jatkoin pubin etsintää ja seuraava yritys paikkaan jonka kyltissä luki public bar. Se tuskin oli ainakaan yksityisklubi. Portaita pitkin toiseen kerrokseen ja nyt näytti aavistuksen paremmalta. Tyypillinen pieni Japanilainen pubi jossa baaritiski ja sillä jakkaroita tai tässä tapauksessa normaaleja tuoleja joten istahdin yhdelle ja tuttuun tapaan ensin tuli kuuma pyyhe ja menu jossa oli ainakin brand namet ymmärtämilläni kirjaimilla. Hanaoluen toki olisin osannut tilata muutenkin ja sellaiseen alkuun päädyinkin. Baarimikko oli tällä kertaa nuorta sorttia verrattuna Nagasakin valkopartaiseen. Olin ainoa asiakas tässä vaiheessa iltaa ja jutustelin baarimikon kanssa sikäli kun yhteistä kieltä löytyi. Hän kertoi ikänsä joka oli 24 vuotta. Esittelin kuvia kamerastani ja ne kiinnostivat kyllä. Minulta kysyttiin halukkuutta laulaa karaokea mutta eihän sitä nyt aivan ilman yleisöä. Ymmärsin kuitenkin IMG_2633 Japanese Apricot or Plum trees että laitteet löytyvät. Sitten paikalle ilmestyi toinenkin asiakas. Paikallinen elämäntaiteilija jolla oli oma nimikoitu pullo baarin hyllyssä ja baarimikko sen lukuisten nimilapuilla varustettujen joukosta kaivoi. Heppu puhui englantia ainakin rohkeammin kuin moni muu vaikka aivan suvereenia ei tuon vieraan kielen hallinta tässäkään tapauksessa ollut. Se ei haitannut vaan juttua kyllä riitti. Karaokelaitteetkin sitten kaivettiin esiin ja hän aloitti länsimaisilla rock-balladeilla. Kolmaskin asiakas tuli pubiin. Tällä kertaa naisihminen joka ei englantia kyllä puhunut sanaakaan mutta saimme kuitenkin itsemme puolin ja toisin esiteltyä. Hän lauloi hiukan Madonnaa ääntäen sanat kyllä aivan oikein vaikka kieltä ei puhunut. Rohkenin valita vihdoin itsellenikin biisin. Alkuun Billy Joelia ja suosiota tuli joko kohteliaisuudesta tai arvostuksesta. Ilta jatkui vielä Stingin Beatlesin ja Cheap Trickin kautta Oasikseen ja venyi jopa pikkutunneille. Paikalliset ovat erittäin kompetentteja karaoken laulannassa joten parastaan sai tosiaan yrittää. Tässä oli vihdoin vastaava pubikokemus kuin mihin ensimmäisellä Japanin käynnilläni olin törmännyt. Aamulla kirjauduin ulos hotellista ja vein reppuni jälleen säilytyslokeroon asemalle. Lounaspaikaksi olisi kelvannut jokin Udon noodeleita tarjonnut paikka mutta en nälissäni sellaista löytänyt ja tyydyin Tonkatsu setin syömiseen. Jatkoin aikaisen lounaan syötyäni rauniolinnan puistoon jossa itse linnaan ei päässyt sisään mutta esittely paikasta oli varsin kattava. Säätila oli aurinkoinen joten oli oikein IMG_2636 mukavaa käyskennellä tässäkin puistossa. Jatkoin matkaa kävellen pari kilometriä kuuluisaan Ritsurin Park puutarhaan. Matkan varrella sitten tulikin useampi Udon ruokala ohitettua mutta lounas tosiaan oli jo syöty. Saavuin puutarhan itäiselle sisäänkäynnille ja sisäänpääsy maksoi siedettävät 300 jeniä. Puutarha olikin oikein hieno paikka varmasti vielä hienompi silloin kun ruoho vihertää ja lehti on puissa mutta toimi kevättalvenkin asussaan. Ikivihreää havupuuta tosin löytyi paljon joten värimaailma ei ollut pelkästään harmaanruskea. Japanilaiset luumupuut tai kenties aprikoosi asian jäätyä hiukan hämärän peittoon kumpi koska molempia nimiä käytettiin olivat jo kovasti tekemässä kukkaa. Hedelmäsato valmistuisikin jo kesäkuussa ja opaskyltit kertoivat siitä tehtävän luumuviiniä. Kukinta oli erittäin kaunista kun nyt en Sakuran eli kirsikan kukinnan aikaan sattunut paikalla olemaan. Aikani puutarhaa kierrettyäni ja paljon kuvia napsittuani kävelin takaisin juna-asemalle ja noudin reppuni lokerosta jatkaen lipputoimistoon bookkaamaan istumapaikkaa Okayamaan lähtevään Mariner junaan. Seuraavan lähtöön oli vain kymmenisen minuuttia joten jatkoin suoraan laiturille ja astuin jälleen samanlaiseen ykkösluokan vaunuun. Okayamassa vaihdoin hyvin sujuvasti Shinkanseniin kun Sakura kohti Osakaa oli muutaman minuutin päästä lähdössä. Matkalla Osakaan ei pysähdytty taaskaan kuin Shin-Koben asemalla joten kaikkiaan tähän etappiin ei kauaa aikaa kulunut. Shin-Osakan asemalla oli aavistuksen pitempi odotus seuraavaa Hikari junaa kohti Tokiota odottaessa mutta vain noin viisitoista minuuttia kuitenkin. IMG_2638 In Ritsurin Park Takamatsu Jatkoin matkaa ja taas torkahdin hetken Kyoton aseman jälkeen. Kohde jonne olin matkalla oli jälleen Nagoya koska ystäväni siellä olisivat viikonlopun vapaalla. Nagoyassa ei pahemmin turistinähtävyyksiä ole mutta loistava seura ja paikallistuntemus on aika lyömätön yhdistelmä. Löysin omin avuin ystävieni uudelle asunnolle pienen metromatkan jälkeen vaikka kiersinkin hiukan erikoispitkää reittiä metroasemalta poistuttuani. Lähdimme illalliselle ensin lihakepakoita tarjoavaan paikkaan ja jatkoimme meksikolaisen baarin kautta vielä haukkaamaan kiinalaisia dumplingeja. Paikallinen tuttavani joka oli mukana kierroksella tulkkasi parin illan takaisen Izakayan kuittia kun halusin selvittää mitä nuo uppopaistetut nuggetit olivat ja valkeni että ne koostuivat ostereista! Matkan varrella ennen tukikohtaan saapumista löysimme vielä yhden pubin läheltä uutta asuntoa ja viereinen pöytäseurue oli heti hyvin kiinnostunut mistä olimme. Yksi heistä osoittautui Hanshin Tigers baseball joukkueen pelaajaksi. Lauantaina halusin vielä hiukan shoppailla joten suunnistimme Osu Kannonin ostosalueelle jossa ensin pysähdys tuoksukaupassa tarjontaa vilkaisemassa ja mukaan tarttui LEau ParKenzo 1500 jeniin. Varsinainen ostokohde jota etsin oli sake kupit ja astiakauppa löytyikin. Sopivan näköistä tavaraa oli ja nopea vertailu viereiseen turistikauppaan paljasti hinnankin olevan kohtuullinen. Turistikaupassa oli huonompilaatuista tavaraa nelinkertaisella hinnalla. Astiakaupan yli 60v. tädit siis pääsivät pakkaamaan minulle neljä sakekuppia hyvään pakettiin. Halusin vielä löytää syömäpuikkoja ja Loft nimisen ketjun kaupassa niitä olikin IMG_2639 Taking a break in Ritsurin Park hyvä valikoima sopivaan hintaan. Ostosten jälkeen ilta alkoikin lähestyä. Tuli siis aika lähteä päivälliselle ja vuorossa oli Yakiniku ravintola. Ystävieni asunnolta oli kohtalainen kävelymatka ja kun pariskunnan parempi puolisko meni edeltä fillarilla pidin itse reipasta kävelyvauhtia yllä kaverini juostessa mukana. Olimme parahiksi pöytävarauksen aikaan paikalla. Yakiniku tarkoittaa lihanpaloja jotka kypsennetään pöydässä olevassa grillissä. Shabu shabuun verrattuna palat ovat paksumpia siivuja. Tilasimme kelpo lajitelman enimmäkseen naudanlihaa eri leikkeinä mukana oli hiukan kanaakin. Liha oli erittäin hyvälaatuista joten ateria oli herkullinen. Jatkoimme ystäväni kanssa tapaamaan lisää paikallisia tuttuja. He istuivat iltaa hyvin perinteisessä Japanilaisessa Izakayassa. Maistelimme hiukan sakea ensin kylmänä ja sitten kuumana. Siirryimme myöhemmin kohti yhden kolikon 500 yen baaria mutta se oli aivan tupaten täynnä joten päädyimme Captain Istanbul nimiseen pubiin vieressä kun löysimme vapaan pöydän ja onneksi täälläkin juomat olivat samanhintaisia eli yhden kolikon per kappale. Taksi vei näppärästi kämpille kun olimme riittävän kauan iltaa istuneet. Sunnuntai aamupäivällä tuli kohdalle suorastaan harvinaislaatuinen tilanne kun ystäväni olivat menossa vanhaa asuntoa luovuttamaan. Voisin turisteilla Nagoyassa hetken aivan itsekseni. Otin aluksi metron kävellen tosin toiseksi lähimmälle metroasemalle ympäristöä tarkkaillen. Kohdalle osui mandoliinimuseo mutta se ei aivan noin aikaisin ollut vielä auki. Metrolla matkustin Fushimin asemalle kävellen sieltä Sakaeen IMG_2646 Yakiniku maamerkkejä seuraten. Paikallistin niin brittipubin meksikolaisen baarin kuin kiinalaisen dumpling paikankin. Sain tv-torninkin näkyviin ja jatkoin sitä ympäröivään puistoon. Aurinko paistoi joten istahdin puiston penkille ja kirin hiukan blogin kirjoituksessa. Käväisin läheisessä convenience storessa hakemassa limun ja takaisin puistoon tullessani minulta kohteliaasti tultiin kysymään suostuisinko valokuvaan. Kuvaaja oli ammattivalokuvaaja jonka avustajat pyysivät ohikulkevia ihmisiä potretteihin puistossa. Suostuin toki ja yksi kuva otettiin sen jälkeen toinen jossa pitelin numerolappua. Kerroin nimeni ja email osoitteeni. Puiston päädyssä oli bändejä soittamassa ja ensimmäinen kuulemani oli varsin huono mutta toinen taas melko hyvä. Ystävani selvisivät asunnon luovutuksesta ja omin pain turisteilu sai hetkeksi riittää. Menimme suht myöhäiselle lounaalle Pepper Lunch nimisen ketjun pikaruokalaan. Annos oli kasattu kuumalle valurautapannulle ja ensin lihanpalaset käänneltiin itse kypsiksi ja lopuksi kastike päälle joita oli tarjolla kolmea erilaista. Oikein hyvää ja hyvin edullista. Iltapäivä alkoi jo olla pitkällä joten tuli aika siirtyä astetta lähemmäksi lentokenttää maanantain lennon kohti kotia lähestyessä.Olin varannut hotellin Shin-Yokohaman aseman läheltä joten Nagoyasta Hikari Shinkansen alle ja kohti Shin-Yokohamaa. Löysin perillä hotellin helposti ja alkuperäinen ajatukseni oli mennä noodelimuseoon jossa syödä myös paivallista siellä mutta kirjauduttuani hotellille hädin tuskin jaksoin enää ulos ja löysin läheltä indonesialaisen ravintolan jossa soin Nasi Gorengin ja IMG_2659 A good band playing at the park sitten nukkumatti kutsuikin. Olin siis erittäin hyvin aikaeroon ehtinyt sopeutua tämän kahden viikon matkan aikana. Maanantaiaamuna kirjauduin ulos hotellista tasan kello yhdeksän kuten olin suunnitellutkin ja käveltyäni asemalle otin klo 0907 Shinkansenin Tokion asemalle. Tokion asemalla varasin paikkalipun JR NEX lentokenttäjunaan joka lähti noin vartin päästä. Ehdin ostaa sämpylän mukaan aamupalaksi ja syödä sen matkan aikana. Kentällä olin paria minuuttia ennen yhtätoista joten marginaalia jäi reilusti. Lento kohti Pariisia oli hyvin aikataulussaan ja tällä kertaa konetyyppi oli Airbus A380. Tähän mennessä kolmas yhtiö jonka kyseisellä konetyypillä olen lentänyt. Tilaa oli tuttuun tapaan varsin hyvin turistiluokassakin. Aivan Singapore Airlinesin tasolle ei AF yllä mutta samppanjaa löytyi jälleen aperitiiviksi ja näyttö turistiluokan penkissä oli hiukan totuttua suurempi vaikka kuvasuhteeltaan vain 43. Lähtömaassa kun oli päivä niin minua ei juuri nukuttanut. Katselin elokuvat Duck Soup Delivery Man Now You See Me ja Wolverine. Turbulenssia oli aivan minimaalisesti aivan alkumatkasta mutta loppu hyvin tasaista. Pariisin kentällä Cityjetin kone oli tällä kertaa onneksi terminaalin luona eikä bussikyydin päässä. Tällä lennolla jo nukutti. Kotona olin 20 tuntia hotellilta lähdön jälkeen. Budjetti paikan päällä oli suunnilleen 100 euroa /vuorokausi sisältäen junamatkat. Hotelleja löytyi useimmiten 40 euroon /yö. Junamatkustusta varten olin hankkinut Japan Rail Passin ennen lähtöä. Kolmen viikon passi maksoi toimituskuluineen 412 euroa. Kahden viikon passi on noin sata euroa halvempi mutta oma matkani kesti 17 päivää kohteessa ja tarvitsin junaa niin alussa kuin lopussakin. Laskin myöhemmin paljonko kaikki toteutuneet junamatkat olisivat maksaneet jos olisin ne yksittäisinä lippuina paikan päällä ostanut ja summa olisi ollut 1030 euroa. Säästö oli Rail Passilla siis melkoinen. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Matkalla Jartsa Joined October 7th 2007 Trips 4 Last Login August 2nd 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 48 Guestbook 57 Photos 737 Forum Posts 0 blog=834244 blogger=49824 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=834244 blogger=49824 Advertisement Brief history of Japan In 1603 a Tokugawa shogunate military dictatorship ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power.

So after a lot of sad goodbyes myself and Vinny headed off on our travels First stop... Abu Dhabi! We arrived at 7am to 30 degree weather and a lot of taxi touts! Ended up throwing our bags and then ourselves into a moving taxi that was pulling up illegally and so paid a little bit less to get to our hotel than a standard taxi!! We are backpackers now so every penny counts! We checked into five star luxury hotel the Sheraton I know I know we are supposed to be backpacking but got a really good deal through a friend! for some R n R and it was savage! After massive breakfast we headed to the pool where we slept for hours under a palm tree! Dinner in the hotel and an early night. Day 2 involved more dozing by the pool so this blog entry will be short and sweet! Headed to a well-reviewed restaurant called the Lebanese Flower for some gorgeous chicken schawarmas and walked around Abu Dhabi trying to find somewhere that sold wine. No such luck! Oh well the only downside so far to the Emirates! So far Abu Dhabi is not as impressive as Vinny having a cocktail! Dubai. The entire city is under construction so much so that in many places there are no actual footpaths so you have to look out for cars and run! Our last day here involved more of the same lying out in the sun! We then headed to the bus station to get a bus to the airport! There is a muslim holiday tomorrow so the station was packed! Made it to the airport and onto a nice flight to Beijing! Oh and the chair in the airport that vinny was sitting in actually broke under his weight cos he was leaning in it akwardly!! So funny he was bit embarrassed and said shoddy workmanship” for about 5 mins but no one understood him!!

The weekend lasts from the middle of Friday until sundown on Saturday. So Sunday in Israel is really the same thing as Monday in the states. So thats why everything is open on Sundays here. Sunday I amazed my grandmother my declining her offer to take me to the mall. Instead I requested that we go to the Diaspora Museum located on Tel Aviv Universitys campus. The Diaspora Museum is one of the largest museums in the world related to the Jewish people and their history around the world in various communities in Europe Asia and Africa. Unfortunately I was not allowed to take pictures while I was in there a security guard admonished me loudly but I did manage to get a picture of the gate to Tel Aviv University. After a bombing on the Hebrew University campus in 2002 all campuses in Israel have become closed campuses so you have to show ID and submit to bag searches to get on to campus. It certainly cuts down on the problem with homeless bums that we have at UF and at Path to the Sea The arches at Sharon were the common meeting place for everybody in high school. Tulane. Anyway the museum was very interesting and certainly comprehensive though I have to say that they havent quite got down the historical narrative concept of organizing a museum the way some museums in the US work. The museum would be greatly improved if there were more artifacts rather than just a few diaramas and reproductions. Also the museum was a little bit text heavy but still really great. I heard more English and European languages in the museum than I did Hebrew which I suppose makes sense. Sunday night I went out to dinner at a restaurant called Spaghettim with my fathers friend and my travel agent Havi and her two daughters Danielle and Mor. Spaghettim is a restaurant in a newer part of town that is trying to be very cosmopolitan. The funny thing about that is that when Israelis try to be cosmopolitan it comes across as hilarious because Israelis as much as I love them are crass and Middle Eastern. Also hearing the translation of Italian-sounding menu items into Hebrew was amusing since the words REALLY dont work in a semitic language. At least English has some roots with Italian. It was still a really Sharon Beach Keep walking... nice time though. Yesterday my plans with my grandmother fell by the wayside after my cousin called her from school to tell her that she wasnt feeling well. So my grandmother went to pick her up and take care of her for the day and I set off for the beach. This was my first time using the public transportation system in Israel since Ive been back and I was slightly nervous that I wasnt going to remember how to do it but from the first rude shout of the bus driver at me to pay already I knew what I was doing. I went to Sharon Beach which was a favorite hangout of all the AIS-ers back in my high school days and after seeing a few american adolescents I knew that it still was the AIS place to be. The weather was perfect it was hot but there was the breeze coming in off the Mediterranean. The beach wasnt too crowded as it was a work day so it was mostly middle and high school students and a few mothers and their children. And the lifeguards who are certainly nice to look at. I laid my towel The Mediterranean Yaaay we made it! out in a prime spot and for a few hours I dozed listened to music and took a couple of swims in the ocean. The water is much warmer in the Mediterranean than it is in the Atlantic theres less seaweed and garbage and no jellyfish! The water was a little rough so the lifeguards kept shouting at all of us to come back but true to Israeli form nobody listened. My favorite part was all the cute puppies that were playing on the beach. Last night I went out for a little while with some more of my parents friends and then I met up with my friends Leeza and Jessica from high school. Leeza is getting ready to start her psychology program at TAU and Jessica is in Medical School here. We went to a sushi restaurant in Herzliya shared a bottle of wine and gossiped about a lot of people from high school. It was nice to see them but we realized how old we were when at midnight we were all ready for bed.

Today was one such occasion and what a fabulous experience it was. We only heard about the Inuyama Castle Festival when chatting to another tourist in a queue at the airport. When we checked our itinerary we discovered we would be only an hour away the weekend it is held so this morning we took the train from Kyoto to Nagoya and on to Inuyama castle. We had a small mishap en route we were briefly separated when train doors closed on us and I had to get off at the next station and backtrack to retrieve Danny! The festival was a something we will remember all our lives with the colour and vitality that seems to be right out of the pages of National Geographic. Its a small town and the festival attendees are 90% locals so we really felt embedded in the culture. Celebrating spring and perfectly timed for the full flowering of magnificent avenues of cherry blossoms the festival dates from the 1600s and the castle around which it is set is the oldest extant castle in Japan. Its signature is 13 impressive floats each 3 stories high and topped with mechanical puppets sometimes described as Edo-era robots. The puppets perform at the shrine and then the floats are paraded down the streets of the old town. They are extremely heavy with rigid axels and the technology reminded me of pictures of the Trojan horse. It takes at least a dozen young men to pull them and about 40 when they need to turn a corner. As well as the puppets there are musicians on board and lots of gorgeously-dressed children in traditional costumes drumming and shouting chants which reminded us of Netzer ruach. Each float represents a different area of the town and theres a good-natured competition as to whose float has the finest decorations and whose puppets perform the best show. Another element was a parade from the shrine which featured young men in white carrying a gilt portable shrine and older men wearing grey costumes and funny flat bamboo hats. A friendly local told us the men in the parade are aged 25 42 and 61 ages regarded as risky in Shinto. They receive a special blessing at the shrine and we watched them being photographed as a group before settling out on their parade. The castle itself is both attractive and impressive all the more so because we had learned our Japanese history. It was built in 1537 by an uncle of Odo Nobunaga - the first great unifier of Japan and subsequently occupied by Toyotomi Hideyoshi the second great unifier. Its now state-owned and a national treasure. We went up the keep - the stairs are incredibly steep almost like climbing a ladder but the view from the top over the courtyard of cherry blossoms is magnificent. In the evenings the floats are usually adorned with 365 lanterns apiece which we were looking forward to seeing but unfortunately the lantern parade was cancelled due to forecast rain which didnt eventuate. The whole atmosphere of the day was delightful - traditional but relaxed family-oriented and celebratory a bit like Simchat Torah crossed with the Santa Parade and topped with cherry blossom. . « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 6 Displayed 6 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Deborah Stone PurpleDeborah Joined August 3rd 2014 Trips 3 Last Login October 2nd 2019 Followers 1 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 59 Guestbook 17 Photos 185 Forum Posts 0 blog=926567 blogger=297108 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=926567 blogger=297108 Advertisement Trips England and Spain August 3rd 2014 -» September 14th 2014 Japan in cherry blossom season March 25th 2016 -» April 16th 2016 Peru August 20th 2019 -» September 9th 2019 3rd April 2016 Zoe non-member comment Wow How beautiful- This sounds like an awesome day Deborah!.

Our first day was mostly spent with a quick swim in the pool a meander along the streets just to see what had changed and then lounging around in the air con room. We were suffering from a bad dose if jet lag which is unusual for us but it was probably due to dehydration. On the seond leg of our flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok we were trapped in our seat. We had the window seat and the middle seat. A lovely young Thai lady was allocated the aisle seat. She smiled sweetly as she sat down and then promptly pulled down the tray table plonked her I pad on it and plugged in her ear phones. As usual with anyone from this area of the world  within minutes of take off she was flat out asleep and stayed that way for practically the entire seven hours. We did disturb her once to get out but it was such a performance to get past we didnt repeat it meaning restricting the amount of water we drank. Once at Bangkok airport we went to find a taxi they have s new system We walked along Soi Rsmbutti from the taxi to our hotel now you pull a ticket out of the machine at the public taxi rank and get allocated a bay number. Ours was 32 of course it was the only bay that was empty all the rest had taxis waiting to whisk you away. He soon turned up and we negotiated the price to Mango Lagoon. 500Baht. Suprizingly it hasnt changed since we first started coning back in 2006. He was quick to point out that he couldnt drive us all the way there as there were many people walking we understood and agreed to be dropped off at the main road. He seemed quite relieved. You can actually drive down Soi Rambutri but like he said there are so many people walking it would take forever. He gave a friendly tour as we battled with the choked up traffic. Despite being 6.30pm on a Sunday it was more like rush hour back home. Once we made it to the hotel it was a quick change into lighter clothing and out for a cold drink and a bit of people watching from Gecko Bar. We didnt really do much next day apart from a dip in the pool and a Tuk tuk struggling through the busy night time streets visit to a Wat close to our hotel. By evening we were recovered. Wed arranged to meet Christophe at 7pm. Wed first met him on Kapas back in 2012 and had bumped into him a few times since over here in various places. It was lovely to catch up and after a long chat and a beer in Gecko Bar we all went to Ranees our favourite restaurant where they do an amazing massaman curry. As the title suggests Bangkok is crazy to get back from Ranees we had to negotiate crossing the main road. A tourist policeman stood in the middle of the crossing arms stretched out taxis and motorbikes slowing down to stop people from either side began to cross when the policeman shouted  go go go and gestured us to run as a private car roared past. Pedestrians scattered everywhere out of the way. We had a couple more drinks in various bars on Rambuttri before Christophe left to make his was home. He was living 20 kms away on the outskirts of Bangkok so had quite a journey. We on the other hand had a two minute walk back to our hotel. Feeling A Wat near our hotel much better next morning we took to taxi river boat along the Chao Phraya river to Wat Traimit  Wat meaning Temple which is supposed to house the largest golden statue in the world . Its made of solid gold and weighs 6 ton and is worth 250 million dollars It was a bit of a walk from the pier to the temple which took us through back streets lined with rusty oily spare parts from old cars and the odd engineering workshop. Stan found that bit fascinating. I on the hand was glad to arrive at the Wat. By the time wed travelled back along the river to our hotel we were more than ready for a cool dip in the pool. Tomorrow we leave the chaos being and head off to Koh Lanta an island close to Krabi. ......scroll down for more photos......... « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 23 Displayed 23 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 8 Message Stan and Sheila woolley Still Crazy We both travelled and worked in Spain which is where we first met back in 1971. Things back then were quite different no plastic card banking or internet to smooth the way. Our travels were put on hold for a few years whilst we brought up our two children. They now spend large chunks of their life exploring the world. In in our mid to late 50s we decided it was time we took up travelling again and this time write our own travel blog. Hope it can compete with the younger generations. We chose the nickname still crazy because I guess thats what we are still crazy.

I stayed home in the morning and tried to rest so my cold would go away. Now I am no longer congested but still have a bit of a cough. For lunch I set off to find the CROUS in this neighborhood. It was kind of tricky had to go inside Université René DesCartes but I didnt know that at first. When I figured out that it was the right number I went inside. I found the place to load my carte CROUS but didnt see the restaurant. Instead of asking someone I was feeling shy so I wandered all the way up and down the stairs to see if it was on another floor. It was not. But then I happened to glance out a window and saw it was in another building in the courtyard. I went inside and it was close to closing time so there wasnt a ton of food left and barely any silverware and no glasses so I have to keep that in mind for the future. I did however have some good soup and a couple of interesting salads and some yogurt. I was wayy too shy to ask to sit with any of the French students...I dont even go to that University although I would have had some things in common with them it was the Psychology building! After lunch I walked to the second hand clothing shop I had found on google maps. Unfortunately what the internet hadnt told me was that it was only kids clothes! They had some handbags but they were all designer and very expensive so i didnt get anything. I did wander by an Office Depot so I picked up some notebooks for school. They all had graph paper or very close horizontal lines with vertical lines too. Last night I watched a House mini-marathon dubbed. The first one was new here although a season behind the States. The dubbing was hard to follow the characters on the show speak quickly in English plus it takes longer to say some things in French so it was extra fast to keep up with the events of the show. The voices also dont fit the people so it seems strange. This morning I accidentally got some towels wet while I was showering and got chewed out for it. However when I apologized she said I didnt know so it was okay. I still feel bad and I am going to ask at dinner if I can take them to the laundromat to have them dried there is no dryer in the apartment. I dont think I should just take them...it might make things worse if they just disappeared. I went to get my schedule today...instead of having 2 hours of French 5 days a week which I thought I would I have 2.5 hours 4 days a week and Wednesdays off except I will probably take a conference on Wednesdays. I dont mind an extra morning to sleep later especially since it starts at 830 and I should leave at least an hour to get there. However the cours phonetiques are usually for an hour half an hour before or after the French classes and that would mess me up taking 2 classes at noon that I wanted. I tried to have it changed and they said there was no room in the 10 oclock 5 days a week that I wanted. There are no phonetics classes before which I probably wouldnt want to get up for anyway. I cant fit it in another time of day because the conferences I want to take are at different times on different days I have at least one in each time slot. So unless I can take phonetics on different times different days of the week which I cant imagine I would be allowed to do I will have to be half an hour late to 2 of my conferences twice a week. Christelle said the professors would understand but I would miss a lot of information! ISA told us there are books you can buy later in the semester with all the courses contents so I guess I will be stuck doing that. I also dont even know if my phonetics class would be 4 or 5 days a week and if it is 4 if it would be an extra 15 minutes. I will have to find out on Friday at the phonetics test. I can also try again to get it changed or take only 2 or 3 conferences but I dont want to do that. At least I got into the Intermediate level which is the one I wanted. Some of the students got into advanced but they are scared because they think it will be too difficult. I am glad because most of the conferences I want to take are for intermediate advanced and superior but one is beginner elementary and intermediate so it is the only level where I can take all the conferences I want. Another plus is that the textbook was free/included! Unheard of in the States thats for sure. It is also fairly small so easy to carry to class. Afterward I went to lunch with a bunch of the other ISA kids and we found the nearest CROUS. it was hard to find in this big university complex but eventually got there and had a good lunch. I had previously looked up some second-hand shops nearby so I could check them out after lunch. The first one was very close to school and I think I may visit it again in the future. It was very small but had interesting things. I liked some of the jewelry in the window but I didnt buy any. I was looking for a purse because as much as I love my Paris one it was becoming too stuffed with my map my ISA handbook a book for the subway umbrella and waterbottle. So I wanted to find a bigger one and it had to close all the way with a zipper to deter pickpockets. Carolin and Arielle have very nice ones from Galeries Lafayette but they were 60€ and I did not want to pay so much for a bag. There were several nice ones at the shop and I settled on a large purple one for only 26€. It may be secondhand but someone took very good care of it or didnt use it much 😊 I am glad that it has a nice over the shoulder strap the short straps on my Paris one like to slide off my shoulder so I have to hold it up which can get tiring. nifty pocket for my carte navigo! I never have to take it out because the machine can read it through the bag 😊 Room for all my books my umbrella and my water bottle! Yay! Also a good place to hook my keychain for easy access to keys. 2 zipper pockets and an open one between them...good for little things that would otherwise get lost in the big part of the bag. perfectly sized cell phone pocket and pocket for my change purse and chapstick the 3 things I had been keeping in pants pockets although I brought some pants and a skirt with no pockets so it is good to have another option. There is also room for my wallet in the purse but I have been keeping my money under my clothing but it is good for future notice! The second shop was extremely disorganized. I looked through the clothes maybe for some jeans but Im not sure what European size I even need. I was going to leave when some scarves caught my eye and i crawled through the piles of clothing on the floor to get over to them. I bought 3 for a euro each. I got a beret for only 2€ as well 😊. I decided not to go to the third store because the weather was quite miserable and it was not very close to these 2. This evening I ate alone again this time because M et Mme are having family over tonight and I apparently am not invited. It is an early night for me tonight class starts at 830 tomorrow! After class I will visit le Louvre again with Catherine and get a feeling for the layout. I plan to discover more of it on Friday night as well!

Jerusalem Jerusalem! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Middle East » Israel » Jerusalem District » Jerusalem April 22nd 2018 Published May 8th 2018Edit Blog Post Laura421 Three of us left at 630AM this chilly grey morning to walk in the Western Wall tunnels the other thirteen members in our group had chosen not to go not to wake up and be out and about so early in the morning. Zvi drove our very small group in his car to a parking lot nearby and then we walked in a downpour to the entrance of the tunnels. No people other than maintenance workers were in the tunnels so early so we were able to walk through at our own pace stopping whenever Zvi chose to offer us more history. I had thought Osama our guide in Jordan was exceptional but Zvi an Israeli is an historian not only knowing all about Israels and Palestines past but also extremely knowledgeable about all the religions and regions and countries and their histories including more in-depth knowledge about Christianity than those of us who grew up in a Christian faith had ever known. It is hard for most of us to try to keep everything straight to try to take it all in all sides all perceptions there is so much information offered. But I always desire to hear more and more. If we hope to try to understand the situation here to get a glimpse of and to learn what it feels like to live in this part of the world then the more we hear the better we can try to comprehend. The rest of the gang met us a few hours later on this now bright and sunny morning. Our tiny threesome had visited the Wailing Wall earlier and put our written prayers in-between the stones now it was the rest of our groups turn to do so. These prayers are regularly collected and buried nothing is burned or thrown away. We also learned that no one reads these prayers so they remain secrets between individuals and their God. I wonder what people wish or pray for whether its for something tangible and specific or whether its for something grand and enormous like world peace. We will never know. After the Wall we walked along the Via Dolorosa seeing and hearing again the 14 Stations of the Cross. The passageways were now full of shoppers and religious other groups were also stopping at each of the Stations but many were praying at each one we were basically just passing through acknowledging each one. A few in our group got separated in the narrow walkways among the frequently pushing milling masses but we didnt lose anyone for very long. The shops the sights smells sounds are like crowded markets many places in the world more varieties of olives and delicious loquats were to be found here but wending our way through this market was not an unfamiliar activity to me. Busy bustling markets are where and how most people in the world do their shopping so much incredibly better than spending time in sterile stores buying packaged and unappealing fake foods and clothing. I prefer this jumbled messiness and colorful confusion to shopping in a modern store or mall any day. We are learning the four quarters of Jerusalem Muslim Jewish Christian and Armenian. Each has its own area of the city most of us are now able to point out where they are located and to name one or two of the important buildings within each. The Palestinian settlements also have their own spaces. This is a wonderful city a meetingplace of multicultural religions mores and contemporary compromises. Crowded with tourists as well as local people visiting their religious holy sites Jerusalem also has its peaceful areas and parks like one of the ones very near to our hotel outside the Jerusalem Railway Station mall the former railroad tracks have been transformed and grassed over into a lovely miles-long pathway where one can walk or bike or just sit and watch people go by. I saw so many young families pushing baby strollers along the pathway happy children running and jumping along beside their parents and younger siblings dogs older people slowly strolling on the path all enjoying beautiful days in the spring sunshine. One afternoon as I was walking in this park I was surprised by the discussion I heard behind me three young Jewish teens were questioning whether Muslims would be accepted into heaven or not. Had these boys been from America they would have been discussing sports or girls but this was a serious debate. I was thoroughly impressed and slowed down a bit to listen to more of their conversation. Our cultures focus on such different things! There are other parks closeby too. One afternoon two friends and I walked in the other direction through another park we could see Old Jerusalem in the close distance so we thought we might walk there. But the artwork in that park was so wonderful and the windmill looked so interesting that we decided instead to just enjoy ambling through and stopping at anything that caught our attention. Deciding only at each turning which way to go we stumbled upon two weddings that afternoon and found a wonderful artists residential area the doors there were painted a heavenly blue and the flowers overhanging the balconies were absolutely stunningly lovely. One of the artists houses was for sale could we join together and buy this as a communal home for all of us? I thought maybe all together we could afford to buy the door. One thing I love learning about Jewish people at least here in Israel is their willingness to always help others in any way they can. We are told this is one of their obligations but I think it is ingrained as it seems so automatic and genuine. Individuals and/or communities all step forward to help anyone in need whatever that need might be. It must be wonderful to live in an extended community like that where everyone takes care of each other. What would the world be like if all people all religions all cultures felt from their hearts that helping others should be paramount giving or aiding in whatever is needed? Perhaps kindness could become contagious. Heaven on earth the Golden Rule. Although after hearing all these histories of violence wars and fighting through centuries it seems doubtful that this could ever be a realistic goal. But there is goodness to be found in simply continuing to try and what really is the alternative? « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Laura Sholtz Laura421 = TP PROFILE START = Former TravelPod Member laura421 Joined December 21st 2011 From lives in Thailand Favorite Book Favorite Movie Favorite Music Hobbies Languages Bucket List Profession Amazing Event Description = TP PROFILE END =... full info blog=1015303 blogger=370877 Blog Map Trips 5 Print Version 8th May 2018 Barbara Cawthorne non-member comment Jerusalem My most interesting part of Jerusalem was the tunnel as well as Via Dolorosa.

We spent our first week in Sydney car hunting and doing a bit of sight-seeing. We found a little Mitsubishi hatchback within our budget with low milage kilometerage? and jumped on the offer. Shes a bit old and shaky but runs great and fits all our bags! We left Sydney early yesterday morning and headed north to Ballina- a 9 hour drive that ended up taking us 12 due to traffic weather and of course car troubles. Our car started acting funny about 7 hours in when Taylor went to put the blinkers on basically the car stopped and restarted itself while we were driving. So we pulled over into a gas station to see what was wrong. When we tried the lights the car died altogether. Perfect. We knew our battery had just died so I went to the car dealership next door to get a jumper kit. I was about to attempt to jump the car when a man parked near us asked if we wanted help. He took one look and noticed that one of the wires had slipped off our battery- hence why it died. He slipped it back on then we drove it to the dealership and had it tightened up for us- no worries mate! We were back on the road again. We are staying with my friend Sophie in Ballina for a few nights then heading to the Gold Coast to visit the family and then onwards to Cairns. Side note we have been traveling for 7 weeks now and have yet to pay for accomodation. Lets see how long we can keep this up! The road is sure to bring lots more adventures so I will be sure to blog more frequently!

Started yesterday 630am hopped in the bus and listened to our tour guide talk about everything we’re going to do. Sounds like this is going to be a wicked trip. But it could very well get costly I just paid $105 for one night food/stay/activities but it was so very worth it. The group is awesome and the place we stayed is super cool. It’s remade to look like a mining village and the activities included a choice of night kayaking/horseback riding/Abseiling going down a cliff on a rope/mountain biking. I chose Night kayaking and biking. After a free lunch a guy from Jersey UK named Chris and I headed Mountain biking which was said to be quite extreme. After a 20 min bus ride we were at the start of the trail and on our way. The Biking really was extreme it was straight downhill with ruts on either side of a dirt path. One wrong move and you’re flying over your handle bars at 50km. After white knuckling my way down we were at the last hill and I hadn’t fallen. One more little hill to go one STEEP little hill. I fell Opera House three times over my handle bars and missed cow shit by a foot. The widow maker” made me its newest member of the widow club. We came back for some relax and then all you can eat pizza for $10. From there we were off to night kayaking which is literally what it sounds. We were going down class 3 rapids in the dark with nothing but a headlamp and really ugly wetsuits. I Purposely chose the ugliest one I could find. It wasn’t as exciting as expected but still a good time I led the pack down the rapids only a few times getting caught on rocks. I eventually started looking for people on rock and just started ramming into them as hard as I could. They were inflatable kayaks so I figure it was all safe. From the kayaking the story goes to As every good story does alcohol. We grabbed our beer and hopped in the hot tub. After probably three too many a few of us including Celeste and Tom  ran down to the creek to scare the second group of kayakers as they finished their trip. We swam through the creek underwater Chris Jersey ON the way to biking and jumped up pretending we were platypus I’m still convinced they were scared shitless even though they won’t admit it. The night continued in its drunken mess and before long I was passed out from fatigue and alcohol. It’s now Day two and we’re on the bus to some place for surf lessons. Should be fun now that Im ‘intermediate’! Thesteps.com.au for pictures more pictures. Today we pretty much drove all day. We made it to the surf camp at Cresent Head and had some surfing. Im stealing their signals Im a common day thief now its time for more drinking and sitting around the campfire. Having so much fun and so happy to be on this tour. I making good friends with some of these people already.

That night we had a fairly largerr fiesta and in spain the partying doesnt start until 12am so obviously with a canadian alin and an aussie me where we party from 8pm onwards we were in interesting states come 1 am haha. none the less fun was had and we had a fantastic night getting to know hectors spanish friends! with our limited spanish and their limited english it made for a riot of a night! the next day hector took me for a special day.. knowing that i love HORCHATA  a spanish tiger nut drink that is amazing he took me to the place on the beach that boasts the best horchata in alicante and it was right! we strolled then through the markets and then he suprised me with tapas on a restaurant on the beach.. the whole menu was in Spanish so i told him to go for it and suprise me... the man knows me well we had prawns with avocado and potatos with aoli and prawns with pepper and vegetables... and more horchata! we then strolled around Old Town with our bellies full and just admired the ancient parts of Alicante... That night was an EPIC soccer to them football! match between Barcelona and Real Madrid which pits most of Spain against each other and made for a fantastic night! people screaming in Spanish cheap beers and people dancing in the street we were eating tappas until 1 am and i looked after a highly funny and drunk boyfriend and we had a ball!! the next day was my favourite that we spent in Alicante Hectors best friend Samu owns a little house in the Mountains in Alicante it is just inexplainable. It has a little kitchen all with no elextricity a pool a patio and literally no neighbours and overlooks the beautiful mountains and beaches... we spent ALL day their and drank beer and hector cooked from scratch Seafood Paella which was mouthwatering and he just solidifed his place as the best cook i have ever met! We headed home around 9pm and were tired so sat on the balcony drinking Horchata and talking. PERFECT the next day me and alin spent the day SUNBAKING. i emphasiss the word since i havent done that in 4 months so we were literaly sprinting to the beach.. it was divine and then that night we went for tapas again with friends and wandering through old town of Alicante... The whole trip from start to finish was authentic the house we stayed in hectors the people we met the spanish we spoke the food we ate. Everything was a beautiful memory made sweeter by the fact Hector and Alin were there. We jetsetted back quite late into London and in two days I am off to amsterdam! so you will see yet another entry.

Shipboard - HERE WE COME! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Middle East » United Arab Emirates » Fujairah December 21st 2008 Published December 21st 2008Edit Blog Post feetwet Pete & Susan Starting Out ! 6.15 am UAE time Sunday morning aboard Rickmer Seoul alongside the wharf at Fujairah following a wonderful night’s sleep on the ship and a whirlwind 36 hours earlier to get here largely without mishap but there is always something isn’t there? The flights from Singapore saw us upgraded from there to Bangkok courtesy of Cathay very nice thank you Cathay and an 8 hour wait in Bangkok before the leg to Amman. No sign of unrest or blockade in Bangkok these days the airport was bustling like a large town but given the distance it now is from central Bangkok and the inability to ‘freshen up’ between legs we erred on the side of ‘sensible’ assisted no doubt by ‘tired’ and remained in transit. Connections were seamless and we landed in Dubai as scheduled at 1pm Saturday. Unfortunately one of our suitcases did not! Much boring drama and recruiting of friends and helpful agents to rectify this worrying development as we taxied our way across UAE to ensure we could catch our vessel before she sailed that afternoon. She didn’t but is due to do so this morning. It seems our bag was located overnight but some additional crossing of wires At the Wharf Guess which one is ours!! has seen it winging its way back to Singapore where we hope and trust we will be reunited with it in about 8 days time. The random selection of packing everything we felt we would need into 2 large suitcases has thrown up some oddities. PP has only the boots he is wearing hardly ship-board suitable and I have a distinct lack of knickers more than adequate supply of bras however. We have all our winter woolies with us most useful for our equatorial travel sector but not my personally tied dyed shorts. Some immediate issues were easily resolved via the selection of ‘duty free’ shops on the wharf they sell almost everything including a fine range of wines from almost everywhere at almost unbelievably low prices - needless to say a considerable boost to morale. We are certainly going to ‘manage’ this coming leg notwithstanding some lack of commodities and as PP was heard to venture it will be good when we get our bag in Singapore so as to be as equipped as we initially intended to be from Singapore! And so to the heart of the matter what is it really like on board a freighter? My first impression even before we reached the gang plank was the all pervasive but subtle smell. That mixture of oil salt water crane-grease and whatever else that marks for me at least being proximate to working ships and harbours. That smell lodged in my olfactory memory before I was two years old during our first passage from Denmark to Australia and has been attractive to me ever since signifying as it does adventure travel new experiences but also safety and solidity. So I was smiling as I tripped literally up the gang plank and we proceeded to our cabin. It is as we expected if not better. Very roomy and light and equipped with magnificent storage which will ensure it will be a most convivial living space for the next 4 or so months. Cursory introductions to the Captain Chief Engineer and Super Cargo were truncated by the need to discuss locating our bag but later we were engaged by our steward Daf and shown about the ship. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Peter Franks & Susan Bothmann feetwet Pilate Pete and Cruisin Susan are a pilot and lawyer team.

So you got there!! Lovely to read of your adventures even with a few frustrations eg the one pair booted PP and the barebottomed CS. Now the real stuff begins and I am looking forward to regular bulletins. All well here - the Londoners arrived on schedule - very tired across the globe with a nearly 2 year old has its unique features and brought a nice brand of English URTI that they have generously shared with all of us! It has been lovely although very busy. Sophia Rose is a delightful little girl with a beguiling smile that melts Grans heart and dilutes any direction that may have been given e.g. no darling dont let the puppy lick your tongue! Off to Coolum on Xmas Eve with Lee et al for a few days and then more family arrive from Darwin for NY. No time for writing other than a Court report which is due 2/1 so that will take a bit of a shine off the holiday period but still hope to read Shrivers latest novel.

Day 6. Uncle Glenn left. We went to the Sawtell Bakery for some yummy food. We met our friends Belinda Luke and Gary. I really like Luke. We have a lot in common. They took us then to the headland at Sawtell beach. It was low tide. Belinda took us over to this Island. She use to go there when she was a little girl. There was a beautiful rock pool there. We swam in it. We saw all types of creatures like crabs birds and shell creatures. Mum said it smelt like sea lions. Dad told her it was the bird doo doo. Luke James and I were dare devils. we got there over the rocks. Day 7 It was raining so we went to Bellingen Dorrigo and Armidale. The road we went on was called Waterfall Way. There are lots of waterfalls as you drive along. The first few were really cool. Dad loved it. boring. I pretended to be asleep after we saw the first 4 waterfalls. We stopped at the old butter factory. I had on the road again... my first sticky date pudding yum! and saw my first naked statue. Disgusting. We went to a cool fish hatchery called Dutton Fish farm. They breed brown trout and rainbow trout. We saw a video and then fed the fish. They all jumped out at once when we threw the food. It was fascinating. It was a long trip. When we got to Armidale dad and I went to this 2nd hand book shop. I got 3 books and so did dad. I got 2 Goosebumps and Quirky Tales Paul Jennings. Day 8 Christmas eve. Uncle Glenn came back. We took him to Sawtell. He loved it...We have a great action shot of cheeks at the rock pools. We had a fun day. We swam played and rode our bikes to the river. Mum and I went for a walk around the town to look at the lights. They were great. I put some biscuits carrots and milk out for Santa. Mum ate one and I was angry with her. Day 9 Christmas! Santa found us!! I got some Pokemon cards some clothes boring and the family got an Ipad 2. James got Donkey Kong Wii waterfall1 he broke the last one clothes boring. Janice Fiona Andrew and Richard gave us this great advent calendar. We have been opening these since 1 December. Today was a big present! I got a travel journal which is really cool and James got his favourite books Cat in the Hat. It made me think of them everyday. We had a good day. I missed everyone a bit but I can call everyone when I want to. We swam played canyon at the beach and had a big walk to Tuckers Rocks. We all went to bed early.

Chris summed up today spot on when he declared it Stunning. It was one of the best touring days ever with 29 degrees of wall to wall sunshine as predicted. The coast was followed closely for most of the day and the first piece took us about half way up the hillside so that the rocky island strewn coast could be seen in all its glory. Most of the villages were occupied by fishermen fish factories and fish markets. Going around one bay we noticed some smoke or dust coming out of a tall building. When we got closer we could smell wood smoke and fish only to find it was a fish smoking factory working on a Sunday. Luckily they allowed us to photograph and film them at their work sorting through the fish and knocking off the dried fins etc. Towards the end of the day we saw that almost every bay had fish farms in the sheltered areas which added to the view. Lunchtime was a real treat when we arrived at a restaurant specialising in savoury pancakes which we found were to die for. The base is flour Savoury pancake time and egg and we had a filling mixture of bacon prawns onions and other lovely tasting morsels. 10 minutes each side on our table which was a hot plate and then various sauces and mysterious powders added. Absolutely delicious. We had a few big hills with hairpins which are a pleasure to descend but less so on the ascent. However the gradients werent too bad and the views staggering. Kites were plentiful today hovering very close to us and at one point there must have been about 40 kites and crows flying together and the crows squawking as they do and the kites jousting with each other. I managed some nice photos of them for a change. We split into two Ryokan tonight and as usual we are expected to take off our shoes at the door. The only problem this time is that the slippers they gave us were of the wooden variety with two horizontal bars for soles. Clip clop. The Onsen was also small and just enough room for two in a cosy/friendly position. It was a good job I was early and on my own. The mens urinals are a also a sight to behold in The two stooges the corridor to the Onsen for all to view at no extra cost. The fumes therein at no extra cost either.

This can often be one of them. The only time i have done this crossing I did the Aranya Prethet to Poipet border which is the closest if you are going to or coming from Siem Reap. However if you are going towards Siep Reap you can easily come up against some issues. Common ones that I think wil cross people minds are below. First of all if you are coming from Thailand as we did you will be dropped of by the bus in Aranya Prethet. From there you will need to get a tuk-tuk out of town to the border which is about 5km away. I cant remember how much we paid but I would say never pay anything more than about 200baht. The most common scam is that they will take you to a fake border where you will have all the documents sorted out for you and put into you passport. This is not what you want as they will charge you an extra fee roughly double of the price at the border. If this does happen to you which is shouldnt if you read all of this its still OK they are all valid documents and will still be able to cross the border with it. Believe me you will know when you get to the actual border... The next problem is the rabit waren of paths and alleys you have to take to get through to the other side. This can be navigated if you follow the instructions below. Last is the price given by the guards for your visa. There is a sign that clearly states the price of your visa is $20 however the Cambodian guards often charge whatever they see fit. There is not a lot you can really do here apart from maybe alert them to the sign but apart from that you will just have to bite your lip and pay the small levy they will put on top. It will be no more than $5. Date Visited 7th March 2010 Border Instructions 1 From Aranya Prethet get a tuk-tuk to the border. The border itself is usually a hive of activity with hundreds if not thousands of people so if you are taken to a quiet office with staff asking to sort your visa out you are not there. Just politely say to your tuk-tuk driver you want to go to the proper border and you are not going to get your visa from here. If they say anything about not being able to get your visa at the border say thats fine but you want to see for yourself anyway. They will take you if you are appear informed and are polite. 2 Once at the border by following people you must get yourself to the Thailand exit area. Here you need to get your exit stamp and move through the building to exit at the back. 3 From here you need to take the passage in front of you where you will encounter some more outhouse type buildings where you will get you will have to complete your medical from and usually pay a dollar for you troubles. There is not way round it you just have to bite your lip. 4 As you exit here some Cambodian border guards/soldiers will ask you if you already have a visa. If you havent previously obtained your visa WHICH YOU SHOULDNT HAVE you should obtain you visa from them. It usually involves filling out a short form and paying the amount of money they ask of you. They will then place a paper visa into your passport and hand it back letting you to continue. THEY WILL NOT PUT YOUR ENTRY STAMP IN YOUR PASSPORT. 5 From here it gets a little messy. You will pass under the official arch which is supposed to be the line where Cambodia becomes Thailand and then continue walking down a road giving the impression you are done. However just as you get passed the large casino there are some smaller huts on your right which is the actual Cambodian immigration. Here you will get your stamp into Cambodia. Upon exiting the huts carry on towards the gate into a waiting area. This is where the free shuttle bus to the main bus station leaves from. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Sam bigwideworld blog=558885 blogger=183566 Blog Map Print Version Travel Blog » Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Aranya Prathet » Blogs » Thailand//Cambodia Border Crossing Tot 3.08s Tpl 0.046s cc 9 qc 42 dbt 0.0794s 3 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

America Travel Blog » Asia » Japan » Hiroshima » Blogs » Heading to Hiroshima Heading to Hiroshima « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Asia » Japan » Hiroshima November 26th 2018 Published December 5th 2018Edit Blog Post NikkiandGreg Before and after the bomb Its a bit like planes trains and automobiles today as we have to make our way from Kyoto to Hiroshima which involves a few trains one bullet train and finally a street tram. We get up early so we can sit down and have a proper breakfast before we leave as we know we wont have much time in between trains and travelling. We find a little cafe that does scrambled eggs with sausages mini frankfurters and pancakes so that sounds good to us. Its double the price of what we paid in Tokyo for the same meal and the pancakes arent nearly as good but it fills us up. We havent booked tickets for the train to Hiroshima beforehand so really hope there are stills seats available and thankfully there are. Its a 2hr 15 min train journey which isnt too bad but were really starting to feel the effects of walking pretty much 12 miles each day along with all the travelling around and our bodies are getting a bit sore. We are looking forward to getting there now and taking it a bit easier. We havent scheduled much to do today which is just as well as we The original remaining building The river was used as the target area are both looking forward to a more leisurely afternoon. We had originally said we might take a boat trip to Miyashima but we both think it would just be far too much of a rush and we wouldnt enjoy it the same therefore decide against it. Its a pity as weve read its really lovely but weve already crammed in so much and can only do what we can. We arrive at Hiroshima station on schedule and this next part of the journey is up to Greg as I havent printed off directions for the next hotel. Greg has reassured me he knows where we are going and he shows me a screen shot of the map to get to our hotel. But not only is it zoomed out so you cant actually see any streets or street signs it looks discerningly far to walk.. I ask how long it says it will take to walk and Greg shrugs and suggests maybe 10 – 15 minutes which I am hugely dubious about. Plus I dont fancy a 15 minute walk with the heavy cases in the first instance along with this bloody umbrella that we have thus The peace memorial far not needed in the slightest so I advise we should check to see if there is maybe a subway we can take instead. In the end we I manage to deduce there is a street tram that will take us all the way to pretty much outside the hotel and its just as well someone is paying attention as Greg isnt much help based on the fact he is tired and hungry and has a carefree och well just walk until we find it kind of attitude. The tram is really straight forward and does indeed drop us off right outside the hotel. Thank goodness we didnt attempt to walk as it would have taken us about an hour! The hotel staff are really friendly and we even have a complimentary breakfast and unlimited tea and coffee which we are both pretty pleased with. Once in I check reviews of the hotel and notice pretty much everyone has mentioned about taking the street tram and not attempting to walk! We make use of the free coffee facilities and then head out for some lunch. There is a little food chain right next to the hotel and The flame will be put out when all nuclear arms are disarmed its one of those vending machine places that you order a dish and then they deliver it to your table which is cool. I order beef udon noodles and Greg orders duck udon noodles. My broth is actually really fishy which puts me off so we swap broths and I give greg all the meat from mine so we are both happy. The Peace memorial park is only a 5 minute walk from our hotel and so we make our way there before it gets dark. Its a beautiful park and of course its really interesting and sobering to see the remains of the building where the bomb was dropped all those years ago. Along the way we spot a chinese tourist wearing a bomber jacket which reads U.S airforce- faster than the speed of a bullet” on the back and we both gawk in amazement at how distasteful it is for a place like this…. Im sure the poor guy has no idea the significance of what his jacket says. We head on to the memorial museum which gives a full history of what happened leading up to and after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It makes for really interesting reading and the collection of clothing and items found after the bomb really hits home how devastating it was. History lesson over for today we head back to the hotel for our usual pre-dinner beers and to relax for a little bit. Even though weve taken it a bit easier today the fitbit tells us we have still managed to clock up 6.5 miles walking! I really fancy some okonomiyaki pancakes again as they were so tasty the last time plus Hiroshima is well known for them. We try one little place only for her to tell us long wait so we keep going until we stumble upon another little place with a grill at the bar so you can watch the chefs make the omelette pancakes in front of you. We order a few washed down with some Japanese beer which we have grown very fond of. Afterwards we buy some japanese cheesecake for dessert which is heavenly – im still convincing myself all the walking we are doing means the calories from our food and beers wont surely count... « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Nikki and Greg NikkiandGreg After a stint at trying the 9 - 5 thing we decided at 27 to rent our house pack our bags and head out into the big bad world.

We arrived with plenty of time to grab breakfast from the station they got hot dogs! and catch the bus. At Mishima Station where we were able to catch a bullet train to Nagoya just a few minutes after we arrived. We had a couple hour ride ahead of us so we got some lunch and snacks for the trip and settled into our seats. As we arrived in Nagoya we had to figure out what we were going to do with our limited time because we were only there one night. Due to a Typhoon hitting the southern part of Japan the weather was awful and pouring out! That made our decision to find something inside. I wanted to try and see a park that had an old pottery factory on it so I made the boys walk with me a couple blocks to the Toyota Museum because that was on the way. Unfortunately with the rain we missed seeing it 2.1431417153.toyota-museum so kept walking on by. Eventually we ran into the museum me surprised since I expected to see the park first but that worked out fine because we were soaked through and ready to be inside at this point despite the jacket I had jacket Fred had and Tylers umbrella. The Toyota Museum was absolutely amazing! It walked you through the start of the company when it originally made looms. The first product for the Toyoda family was a circular automatic loom that changed the world of looming. Since making cloth is a long standing process the museum walked you through the history of how it works and all the technical advancements included with it up to the current automated process Toyota uses today. It blew all three of our minds because while how we talked about the cotton industry in history class we never went into the mechanics behind it so all us engineers were in heaven. The fact that cotton is an amazing enough material that you can pull and twist it out to make a thread then just spin it to make it tight enough to become a string is incredible. There were a ton of 2.1431417153.1-toyota-museum live demonstrations of real live old school looms that we were able to fully understand the details behind them. Engineers in heaven. Then it moved on to the automotive section of Toyota and talked about how it got started and the process. Back in the 1930s the son of Toyota started reverse engineering American automobiles to learn to make a car. He started with a truck and moved on to a personal vehicle. In just a few years he had a fully operational production line set up to produce these cars. At that time the company renamed itself from Toyoda to Toyota to clarify the sound separate the family from company and make the strokes from 10 to 8 8 is a lucky number in Japan meaning good fortune and future success - guess it worked. Then we walked into the candy store part of the museum. They had broken down the components of the car to the point where you could see into the engine transition etc. They had moving demonstrations and videos that clearly outlined how everything worked best part is the demonstrations were with real components not just plastic replacements. We spent the rest of our time 2.1431417153.2-toyota-museum jumping from thing to thing and then walking through their mock setup production line. We could push buttons that ran live operating machines like those on the operation floor forging drive shafts stamping out doors painting the car welding the body and assembling the pieces. SO COOL! There were some completed cars on showcase that were exciting to see. That included the original car and truck. The truck had brushes covering its wheels to clean off the mud from the unpaved roads of the 30s/40s. We could have spent another hour in the museum but unfortunately it was closing time. The end of our tour was with a Toyota robot that could play the violin there seems to be a big competition between companies to come up with the first real life helpful robot - the one at the Innovation Museum in Tokyo was from Honda. We headed back out into the pouring rain to catch a train back to Nagoya Station so we could redirect ourselves on a subway line to Lukes apartment. Luckily he lived a short 10 minutes walk away from the subway so while we were wet it could have easily been worse. Unburdening ourselves 2.1431417153.evening-drinks at Lukes and changing into dry clothes we headed into the weather in a car this time! to go to a nice restaurant. Luke told us this would be an experience dinner. The dinner was in multiple courses and we got two different types so we could all share the food to try everything. We ate through maybe 8 different sets of dishes with everything from sushi to soup to dessert. Luke ordered us a special roll to top off the meal - he quietly warned me to just hang back and watch the boys eat it. The laughing staff tipped us off that it woudl be something different. Fred saw it was green and made a comment about it being mint. One bite later his face was hilarious! A special roll is just rice and seaweed rolled around a bunch of wasabi. Tyler didnt seem as surprised since he went second but it definitely hit him too! Somehow the three of them finished the entire thing off. Overall it was a beautiful dinner and we were all surprised by the impressive amount of Japanese that Luke knew after only being in the country for 8 months. Not ready for 2.1431417153.3-toyota-museum the night to end the boys convinced Luke to bring us to a bar nearby. Luke was obviously a regular here because all the bartenders knew him and came right over to help us out. Of course the guys wanted some Japanese whiskey so the bartender hooked them up with some really good stuff. I enjoyed my little cocktail while they raved about the whiskeys they were trying. Fred had to compare to the stuff he tried at the Tokyo bar Nemo. We proceeded to regail Luke with our crazy stories from the trip so far. Meanwhile Fred was munching away on the nut mixture the bartender provided us I have no idea how they were hungry after that huge dinner. Fred acidentally ate one of the pistachios thinking it was a cashew with its shell on. One of the crackers was wrapped up as well. Fred somehow misunderstood that it was chocolate so popped the whole thing in his mouth. Next thing we know hes practically on the floor crying! It was a wasabi cracker and even worse than the special roll! Lucky to have Luke along our bar tab only totalled 1000 yen! To close out 2.1431417153.4-toyota-museum the night Luke took us down the street to a video game bar to challege Fred to Golden Eye. He destroyed us all at the game. So instead we had to challenge him to something different. It took Fred awhile to find something since it was all in Japanese but we ended up playing Smash Brothers! I was excited because I hadnt played that game since college but actually knew what i was doing unlike some of the other games. I did a pretty good job holding my own but Fred wiped the floor with us on that one. Soon we were all exhausted especially since we had another early morning the next day. However Luke had too much to drive us home so we had an adventure with Tyler trying to drive us back to Lukes apartment. It would have been fine but all three of us were backseat driving the entire trip back. It took no time at all for all of us to crash. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 10 Displayed 10 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Bobbi Wendorff bwendorff Joined May 21st 2017 Trips 2 Last Login September 10th 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 57 Guestbook 0 Photos 451 Forum Posts 0 blog=965875 blogger=370342 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=965875 blogger=370342 Advertisement Brief history of Japan In 1603 a Tokugawa shogunate military dictatorship ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power.

It was fun we went up and back on the Brunswick River. Half way we stopped for lunch and then turned around to go back. Going back was hard as we were going against the wind but we did see lots of blue jelly fish and sting rays 😊 We changed our plan from living on the Gold Coast for 3 months as it is similar to Toronto but just with a better beach so we decided to go fruit picking instead. So the next step was to find a car and drive south towards the fruit picking for the rest of the summer a couple people suggested we go south for the summer and then go north for the winter. It took us almost a week to find a car but we got a little Nissan. Once we got the car it was relief - we could head south to finally get jobs 😊. But before we could do that Scott wanted to pop the question on the beach 😊 YAY Before we left Bryon Bay we asked me to marry him which I said yes. Next we drove down to Sydney. Stayed the night in a super sketchy Motel Room it wasnt cheap either but it was the only room we could find that late in the evening. There were stains all over the walls the shower was just part of the floor and it was super awkward. But it was a bed and I didnt want to sleep in the car. Then we went to Aubury to stayed with family friends for 2 nights. It was so nice there was a super pretty lake that we went swimming in and did a couple errands. Then it is off to the fruit picking farm. Stay posted to see how the fruit picking goes... « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message CHenry chenry blog=874076 blogger=306002 Blog Map Trips 1 Print Version Travel Blog » Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Balranald » Blogs » Fruit Picking... why not...

We have a train to catch to Hiroshima and wanted to get away early. Alarm was set for 600 but we were both up before the alarm went off to finish packing bags before heading down to breakfast. We chose the Japanese breakfast this morning. It was a beautiful selection of tasty morsels of fish rice chicken miso soup and some fruit to finish with. Portions were sensible and it was an excellent start to the day. Because we were up so early we were able to transfer to an earlier train once we were at the station. Again our timing with catching trains and busses has been amazing. We arrived at the station around 745 swapped our tickets and were pulling out of the station at 800 bound for Hiroshima. The bullet trains are amazing. All things considered its such a smooth ride and you really feel the power as they take off and Ive always preferred train travel over flying as you can see more around you as your travel. Arrive at Hiroshima and after a chat in the information centre went to drop our bags at the bag drop so we could get on with the day more quickly. Found out that they had a hotel delivery service as well as a bag drop which worked perfectly for us. Caught a local train to Miyajima and a ferry across to the island and spent about 4 hours wandering around looking at the village and a number of the shrines etc on the island. A very interesting place. We returned to Hiroshima and went to the castle and then the A-Bomb Dome which is where the first atomic bomb was dropped. These ruins were basically the only remnants of the city after the bomb as everything else was flattened for miles. It rained while we were there but only gently. We had heard that there was a typhoon predicted somewhere in Japan but this was clearly not the place. It was while photographing the dome that Bretts camera stopped working! We went up to a lookout tower for a panoramic view of the area and watched the sun go down and the city lights start to go on. Very relaxing after what had been a long day. Our final stretch was to wander through Peace Park before heading to the hotel. We stopped for a quick bite to eat and then across the road to the hotel. Both of us were very tired so we turned in early. Random thought for the day toilets on the bullet train are much bigger than on a plane! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Brett Crosby CrosbysAtLarge blog=1019368 blogger=363429 Blog Map Trips 3 Print Version Travel Blog » Asia » Japan » Hiroshima » Hiroshima » Blogs » Typhoon Day Tot 3.115s Tpl 0.015s cc 9 qc 49 dbt 0.0416s 3 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.3mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

We had a hotel booked in the Gracia district of Barcelona which is less touristy and getting there was a breeze. We bought a T10 1 zona card at the automat at the airport for a fraction under 10eur and with only one change on the subway and a 5 minute walk we were at the hotel La Casa Del Sol overlooking the Placa del Sol. The hotel was great but we were only in it 5 minutes before heading to a little tapas bar Id heard about called Casa Mama down some little side street a few minutes walk from the hotel. The place was heaving the tapas was fabulous so i just kept ordering. Its amazing how much your Spanish improves after a few beers at least I thought it did. If you are in the Gracia district this is definitly SagradaFamiliaInt2 the place to go to see the Spanish at play. We finally called it quits about 11.30pm just as the place was firing up. Not bad for a Wednesday night. Thursday morning we were up bright and early and making use of the T10 card to get us to La Sagrada Familia for the opening at 9.00am in an effort to beat the crowds. We thought wed failed in that but reconsidered after seeing the queue outside when we exited it was astronomical. The church has got to be seen to be believed words will not adequately describe it. It is truly awe-inspiring. After almost 3 hours in the church we took ouselves off to Placa Catalunya to take a wander down Las Ramblas the main pedestrian thoroughfare. Las Ramblas was created when Barcelona tore down its medieval wall and created an elegant promenade. We wandered down Las Ramblas in the general direction of the harbour watching all the people promenade before stopping at La Boqueria market to drool over the charcuterie cheese vegetables and fish on offer until our hunger got the better of us and we stopped in a seafood tapas bar at the rear of the FishMarket market for a heaped plate of deep fried baby squid and a plate of roasted vegetables. Absolutely delicious. Feeling nicely replete we took to the street again checking out the Joan Miro mosaic in the pavement and generally marvelling at the beautiful buildings like the former umbrella shop with umbrella mosaics and a chinese dragon on the walls and the Liceu opera house. We took a 30m detour for a look at Palau Guell the first of Gaudis moderniste buildings. Continuing on down Las Ramblas we hit the Raval neighbourhood with surreal human statues that spring to life when you drop coins in their box. Las Ramblas ends at the 200ft Columbus monument on the waterfront. After watching the boats coming and going for a while we took a stroll along the waterfront then took the metro back to Placa Catalunya to start our second walk of the day through the Barri Gotic. This is the birthplace of Barcelona where Christians and Jews lived within the ancient Roman walls until the 1850s when the city expanded. The barrio is a real mix of ancient churches fountains and monuments including Barcelonas original gothic cathedral and the remains of the Roman Charcuterie temple of Augustus. We stopped in El Call the Jewish quarter with its narrow passages where the medieval Jews were forced to live and visited the old synagogue from the middle ages finally finishing our meanderings at Placa del Rei home of the old royal palace. Having dragged our aching feet back to Placa del Sol we sat over wine and tapas for a while watching the goings on in the plaza finishing the day with pizza and more red wine. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 6 Displayed 6 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Alistair Johnston AncientWanderer After an interlude of around 26 years its time to drag the backpack out of the basement and see a few of the places I missed the first time around.

Onsen Explorer. Day 3. Monday 17 June. Sakura Onsen It was raining when we arrived yesterday and it lashed it down all night. Things are looking bad for today. It has been decided to take the local bus at 9.20 to iutfirst break stop in the valley at Ishinoto. Despite this bad news we had a good stay at the Ryokan with the relaxing onsen an amazing meal last night and a good Japtbreakfsst this morning. These Ryokans are certainly not 5 star hotels but traditional hostels with wooden structures flimsy sliding doors and fibre or paper walls with tatami mats on the floor of the rooms. During the evening meal someone comes along and makes up your bed of a thin futon on the floor with a bean bag pillow and a nice duvet. Sleep tight. All in all a great experience which you will not find anywhere else. There is also a slipper ritual where you leave your shoes at the entrance and use their slippers which are not handed and can easily slip off especially on stairs. Upon entering a toilet you have to change slippers for some more awaiting you at the doorway. The onsen is Lupins another experience. In your room you find a Yukata with belt and jacket which you dress in. You then take the two towels provided to the onsen. A basket is provided Where you put your large towel and your Yukata. You take the small towel which you use for modesty and go to take a good shower sat on a small stool with all the soaps provided. You then dip into one of the Onsens putting the small towel on your head or on the edge of the pool. Often there is an outside onsen and maybe two indoor ones all of different temperatures of up to 42 degrees C. When finished you take a quick shower dry of roughly with the small towel and then go to the changing room to dry off thoroughly if you can due to the heat and humidity. Back to the cycling. It was still raining hard at 9am when wet were due to start so it was decided to take the regular bus for the first leg. We all jumped on the bus - with one exception - Paul had decided that he had other priorities and was nowhere to be seen when Manhole cover. No 1 More to come you can be assured. we boarded and thinking he was at the back of the bus it set off without him. Luckily the van was still there and he jumped into that and met us at the stop. After 25km of bus riding we put on our kit and began cycling on a wet road but with only a fine mist of rain. We followed a picturesque full running river uphill stopping at the kumoinotaki Falls. This was followed by a good descent and another small climb to our lunch stop by the lake. After skirting the lake there was a long climb and a great fast descent for some to the tea break by a lovely wooden bridge and water wheel by a shrine. The last leg was 20 km with a couple of small bumps and a pleasant ride along a narrow valley with rice and vegetable fields. The Ryokan was just before a long tunnel going into Odate. Dinner was a nice banquet again after a lovely dip in a very hot onsen until my fingers went curly. Long live the onsen. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 8 Displayed 8 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Richard Dugdale Pennyfarthing I am a retired engineer born in 1945 who loves cycle touring.

We had the entire 6000 sq. ft. 17th floor penthouse to ourselves! Lazy days spent at the pool soaking the sun up at Batu Ferringhi Beach and exploring Georgetown an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our apartment was like a museum Buddha statues inside and on the wrap around balcony gorgeous Chinese pottery Art pieces everywhere and Asian Bric Brac scattered throughout. In Penang we are introduced to Grab the company that put Uber out of business in Malaysia. Our condo is centrally located so grab fares to Batu Ferringhi beach is about $6 Can/18 RM and Georgetown $2 Can/6 RM. What a foodie paradise. So many restaurants and street food markets. We rarely spent more than $30 Can/90 RM for a dinner that usually include 2 to 4 drinks! Such a range of international foods Chinese Malaysian Japanese Mexican Italian Irish and we even tried a Syrian restaurant. Love Lane was a favourite go to in Georgetown as they had live music and so many restaurants – a popular destination for the backpack crowd. One meal that we loved and was very unusual was Delicious Expresso Chicken! at the Wheeler coffee bar and restaurant Expresso Chicken. A nicely cooked breaded boneless chicken on a bed of mashed potatoes and covered with asparagus and carrot spears. The plate was swimming in a yummy sauce of heavy cream milk with a touch of sugar. It was served with a cup of expresso that you poured over it for a delicious and unique flavoured sauce. To die for! I also discovered and love Mango sticky rice warm mango over a bed of rice and drenched in coconut milk. Georgetown was interesting to explore from Fort Cornwallis to the pier restaurants and Ferry docks to Little India and the art streets painted with unique murals. Architecture ranged from old colonial homes to Mosques and Temples – always something to see as you wandered through the streets. A trip to the top of Penang Hill with the Habitat - Langur Way Canopy Walk giving you a feel for what the original jungle was like before the British clear cut the hill. The Walk included the nest and viewpoints that had large swings to enjoy – a perfect 1 hour saunter! The top of the hill had Darold in Jungle on Penang Hill a lot of historic buildings including a Mosque and a Buddhist Temple. A highlight was the Kek Lok Si Buddhist Temple sprawling at the base of Penang Hill. Penang Hill is actually a range of hills and the Kek Lok Si Temple had the original verticle train that took you up to the huge statue of Kek Lok Si. Batu Ferringhi Beach was our regular beach with a Night Market in the streets and beach restaurants along its 4 km stretch. Our favourites were Bora Bora and Frandys at the far end of the beach. Both had tables for dinner right on the beach and food was delicious. The Blue Cheese steak at Frandys another to die for dinner! Monkey Beach was a lovely quiet and clean beach that you could hike to in 2 to 3 hours through the jungle in the National Park or take a boat to from the National Park Gate only 50 RM each way for the 2 of us about $33 Can return. We brought our own picnic lunch but there were restaurants on the beach and of course lots of monkeys! Giant reclining Buddha at Thai Buddhist temple - Penang We ended our time in Penang visiting the Reclining Buddha at the Wat Chayamangkalaram Thai Temple on our last day after a night celebrating St. Patricks day celebrated from March 5th to 7th at the Healy Mac Irish Pub at Straight Quay. We had fun drinking and dancing to an Irish Elvis Impersonator with Jennifer and her friends! Jennifer was the housekeeper who worked for the owners of our Home Exchange and she was delightful. She advised us as our tour guide during our 3 week stay and we soon became friends. It was a nice perk at this home exchange since she came 3 times a week to clean. We only had to clean up after ourselves! PS When we left Penang there were no cases of COVID-19. We spoke with Jennifer on March 18th and she and many others are now isolating themselves and Penang now has recorded cases. As this is the major issue on all of our minds we have been diligently watching as the world pandemic unfolds.

The land is generally well-farmed which we judge by the standard of the farm houses and machinery. Gently rolling mostly sheep with some cropping and some cattle. Little bit of grapes and others too. The countryside is fairly hilly in the east and flattens slowly the further west you go. Wagga Wagga known to the locals as Wagga has about 40000 people and is the largest inland town in NSW. It is on the Murrumbidgee River and is almost exactly half way between Sydney and Melbourne. We took a drive out to Narrandera which is inside the fruit fly exclusion zone so had to dump a few apples. There was no inspection so don’t know how it works. We stayed two nights at Junee just north of Wagga. Junee has a chocolate and licorice factory which is a compulsory stop. Pure licorice tastes somewhat like cinnamon. The major ingredient is molasses. North to Bathurst. On the way we passed through Cowra which has a lovely Japanese Garden constructed after WW2. At Bathurst we met up again with Ken and Junee Hotel Marlene Southwell for a few days. Ken comes up for the Bathurst races every year and has a great campsite very near the end of Conrod Straight. The track is a public road with a speed limit of 60kmh and is full of walkers runners and skateboarders. On Conrod Straight we got passed by a couple of skateboarders! It’s very steep too. Due to photos traffic etc we weren’t able to challenge the course record. Then west to Parkes through a few small agricultural towns which were quite similar. Parkes has a large radio telescope which is the only tourist attraction around. The campground was quite funny as it sloped everywhere and it was entertaining watching arrivals trying to find a level spot and failing. Parkes mostly grows wool and wheat but they have just opened a gold and copper mine north of the town. Again!!! B..… lucky Australians. Finally north to Dubbo where we have been for a few days. Ken & Marlene were with us and we did the town’s attractions – the old Gaol and the Western Plains Zoo now run by Taronga in Sydney. The zoo keeps assorted animals in fairly large enclosures where Cowra Japanese Garden they have plenty of room. The temperatures were very cold so the animals were pretty miserable but the spectators were cold too. On Tuesday we said farewell to Ken & Marlene. When we were staying with them in Canberra we worried a little that we were imposing but when we left they came with us!!! Don’s great grandfather lived and died in nearby Narromine so it was good to do a bit of research. We’re glad he left the town as it’s typical of outback rural towns – on what looks like a slow decline. Anyway most if not all of the rellie’s left years ago Don’s grandfather coming to NZ between 1900 and 1905. The great-grandparents are buried in Narromine Cemetery and the grave is still in good condition. Scroll down past the ads etc for more photos.

Shannons Uncle Bob passed away which was a pretty sad time for everyone. Even thought we couldnt make it back to say our final goodbyes we were thinking of everyone at this sad sad time. So love ya Uncle Bob xx Losing Uncle Bob reassured us we are doing the right thing as you never know whats around the corner & you really have to things now not wait for the right time as that right time may never come...or one day itll be to late. So our first day we were pretty excited waking up to make hot cuppas as the temp was about 1 or maybe minus...well the whole cuppa thing didnt work out to well as all our water taps hoses etc were frozen!!! We rugged up & hired some toboggans & Shan & Maddi hired snow boards. We were excited as soon as we seen a few snow capped mountains. We had a great day toboganning building snowmen etc. The temp was about 7degrees that day. 019 Tobbogan time Maddi did a mad triple flip the first go The next day the boys & I hung out at the van while Maddi & Shan went for a snowboard lesson & a day of snowboarding...which they loved & were extremely good at...but the snow was starting to melt 😞 The one thing we really wanted while we were there is for it to snow. So the next 2 days we did some school work went to the park & rode around just some general quiet time. The locals were daying yeah snow over the weekend so fingers were crossed they were right. I woke up early Sunday morning it was cold & sooo windy I think the wind was about 50km/h which when your in a van feels pretty dam windy. Anyway the caravan park owner came knocking later on & said it was snowing up at Selwynthe snowfields we were heading to YAY we were excited..then we check the local weather on the net and holy crap a Blizzard was forecast....we werent quite sure if this was bad or ok. SO we got our snow gear on and went for a drive. The snow started not long after we left WOW it juts got thicker & was the 134 most beautiful thing ive ever seen. Driving through was scary at times...the snow ploughs hooned around pushing all the snow to the side of the road. But it was awesome...lakes were frozen trees & hills for as far as you can see white..its was just unreal. We got out just catching snow & they really fall like the pictures..proper little snow flakes! The boys were eating it off the ground...Deac reckons it was the best day of his life & I reckon he might be right!! Someone did run into a snow plough tho so that wasnt so good. We headed up again the nest day after they had over half metre of snow built snowmen tobogganing was a lil slower as the snow was so soft...but i have to say I think this might have been an experience of a lifetime..this is why we doing it...loving it!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 41 Displayed 24 « Back 1 2 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Kristeena Shannon White WanderingWhites We have sold our house bought a caravan packed up our 3 kids and are off to travel OZ...but first Shan & I are heading to Kuala Lumpur for a bit of R&R with no kids for 10 days!!... full info Joined June 13th 2010 Trips 0 Last Login August 31st 2010 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 8 Guestbook 28 Photos 214 Forum Posts 0 blog=520769 blogger=165691 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=520769 blogger=165691 Advertisement 136 Snow qaud Koby wants one 023 142 032 Koby on his own 071 more snow angels Selwyn Snowfields 038 154 frozrn mirror 078 182 Gorgeous snow girl 046 156 080 183 050 157 085 186 « Back 1 2 Next » 4th August 2010 Mum... non-member comment SOOOO JELOUS!!!!

Our train tickets didnt have carriage or seat numbers and we had heaps of time so decided to check it out with the ticket office turns out our connecting train from Basil to Strasbourg had been cancelled nice of someone to advise us! Fortunately the gentleman who served us was excellent and he sorted out a new connection which departed less than an hour later than the original one and explained that the station in Basel was undergoing renovation and our train would leave from a platform that was not part of the main terminal and we would have to walk out of the terminal building and down an alley to get to our platform. This information was really helpful otherwise I think we would have been really confused and would have second guessed ourselves when trying to find the train. Made it to Strasbourg mid afternoon dropped our bags into our beautifully air conditioned Strasbourg Cathedral room and caught a tram into the central part of Strasbourg. It is very beautiful all old picturesque buildings eateries tourist and fashion shops all extremely touristy not sure if this is the main town or if only the tourists hang out here. We walked for a few hours visited a very beautiful cathedral which had major cracks running right through it considered myself very brave to stay in there! We eventually found petite France took lots of photos had a drink in a bar where we were the only people over 30 let alone over 50 and finally found somewhere for dinner that was open before 7 pm just! Day 2 Not an exciting read sorry woke with a stinking headache got up had breakfast and went back to sleep until 12 by the time I woke we were having a thunder and lightening storm and raining. Read our books for a couple of hours to see if it cleared in the end gave up and walked to tram in the rain had another wander around town tried to catch one of the boats that go round the river but it was fully booked for the day Strasbourg Gareth the Gargoyle well after 2 pm so found a place for a quick lunch. Two ladies at table next to us had the oddest lunch the first one had ice cream covered in cream in a little bowl the second had a dish of whipped cream then ten minutes after they finished the ice cream lady had a refill of ice cream then a few minutes later a huge bowl of whipped cream arrived and they both proceeded to eat that never going to question my food choices again if bowls of whipped cream eating is acceptable lunch habits. Headache still an issue so after wandering about got another half hour took the tram back to hotel for another 3 hour nap. Dinner in the hotel and watched the football on the TV in the bar at the hotel no commentary couldnt have understood it anyway but they had a singer and a keyboard player playing at the same time as the game was on I think all the guys watching the game would have happily told them to buggar off but obviously not an option. Chatted to some lovely older German ladies for a while one spoke excellent English Strasbourg Stained glass beauty and translated for everyone they are on a bus tour for a few days and were very funny particularly the one who spoke English. Leave tomorrow for Franfurt so will be just a travel day and we have found out today that everything will be shut for the two days we are there as its Sunday when we get there and public holiday Monday and as much as our media like to proclaim we are the only country in the world that closes shops etc occasionally  how can we possibly be a nation that welcomes tourists when our shops shut Easter we are in fact open more often than any other country we have visited in Europe who seem to be regularly closed Sundays and anything that vaguely represents a public holiday.

From our accommodation in Mulhouse it was not a long drive to Colmar so we arrived fresh and ready for action. We were all set to follow our guidebooks advice on the best carpark to use but with the vital road to same closed alternative arrangements were necessary. We have always found that when in doubt heading for Centre Ville is a sure way to find the carparks. Sure enough after some interesting negotiation of narrow streets we emerged to see an almost new parking building our first in France. In we went well pleased that not too many other tourists had got in before us. Colmar presented us with immaculately decorated half timbered houses some with walls at crazy angles window boxes flower baskets delightful narrow lanes little canals with many bridges in some areas plenty of restaurants and shops as well as plenty of tourists to take advantage of all on offer. The gingerbread man story was brought to life with every kind of merchandise imaginable widely available. The Colmar Bright cheerful flowers everywhere. storks that are encouraged to nest atop steeples also will be due royalties from all the soft toy versions hanging enticingly outside gift shops. We wandered and appreciated all the charms of this popular town then with a rain shower starting we used our map to get back to the car and left to explore other Alsace delights. Knowing we couldnt possibly do justice to all the lovely villages in the area we decided to spend the most time in Eguisheim which was highly recommended in our trusty guidebook. But first we wanted to track down an American World War ll memorial to those who died helping to liberate Alsace. Tracking this down was easier said than done. We knew it was on top of a hill near Kayserburg  and being American expected to see that in the signage pointing the way. Eventually we found the elusive memorial by following a sign pointing us to a necropolis. The memorial is on what is still known by the locals as Bloody Hill. Further on is a French cemetery containing the graves of 1600 soldiers including many moslems from North Africa who fought and died. On a clear day you Colmar can see across Alsace and away into Germany from this point. Eguisheim is not far south of Colmar and is seemed to us just as pretty but on a smaller scale. It is a village made for strolling stopping admiring and photographing. We did all that then suddenly weariness descended and we headed back to the modern world lest we fall asleep and do a Rip Van Winkle in Eguisheim. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 9 Displayed 9 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 4 Message Chris & Marilyn Miltonrabbit The happy travellers.... full info Joined August 31st 2008 Trips 2 Last Login August 10th 2019 Followers 4 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 365 Guestbook 117 Photos 1588 Forum Posts 2 blog=887933 blogger=89207 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=887933 blogger=89207 Advertisement Colmar Little Venice Colmar The latest in dresser design.

My heart goes out to their families. Hello Shalom Salam Bonjour! Besides being on crutches which is not so much fun in my life I tend to keep myself busy with writing. Not that you would actually know that from my horrible habit of not uploading new blogs but rest assured I do write on a fairly consistent basis. Now because of my injury that seems like all I have time to do! 😊 and 😞 Anyhow one of my newest writing endeavors involves writing for Instablogs which is a concept based out of India where many bloggers or Citizen Journalists come together and report on different news items in the world. The tagline is that Everyone has an opinion. Now if that isnt the place for me and my writing then I dont know where it is. Which speaking of I love Travelblog here but it seems to me like I should perhaps move my blog to a more wider network such as Blogger or WordPress? I guess I must contemplate this a bit more...or I could just cross-post and stay here as well. ACK! I think too much... Ok back to Instablogs. As a Citizen Journalist CJ I am responsible for writing daily an 2nd Lebanon War Some of the massive destruction this country endured the summer of 2006. article on anything that I want but mainly a focus on politics and society in where I live. Being a dual-citizen this of course give me free range for both Israel and the United States which to be honest is enough fodder to fill up many many blog pages on the vast internet. Instablogs newest addition to their already impressive arsenal of tools is the Global Report  which takes the top news headlines from around the world and puts it together in a daily show. Certain news stories and their respective CJs are chosen to do short 60 second voice-over clips and its all put together into a narrated news reel complete with video music and pictures to illustrate the articles being talked about. Just like you would see on TV. Its rather fascinating actually and Im pretty proud to be a member of this project. You can hear my latest addition to the Global Report here as well as my latest opinion article on the Israel and Hezbollah Prisoner Swap here! By the way sorry for heavy linkage going on within my blog here - Im getting used to it writing for various other people. Please do Dont Worry...Its not Loaded This was me in 2004. Im pretty sure the soldiers broke some type of law by allowing me to handle their weapons. But it did spark my interest in wanting to serve the IDF - minus the pink shirt. bookmark and check out Instablogs however on a daily basis - youll see a bunch alright - 5 so far! of articles written by me as well as talented people from all over the world. You may leave comments star articles so that they are moved to the front page hint hint - this is also how I get paid - if my articles are accepted by the general community I get paid a certain amount of money! and see other citizens opinions of world wide news not just newspapers and other sometimes biased media. Also up on the writing block is Online Casino Reports in which unless youre rather slow - this is an online forum for gamblers to meet and read news articles opinion pieces etc. Im not a gambler myself - in fact Im too cheap to gamble because I barely have enough money to pay my rent let alone waste it on cards and such but the sad fact is that a lot of the freelance writing jobs here in Israel are for online casinoes. Im not particularly interested in this but I am interested in that they pay my bills! Firefighting Some updates View in Lebanon Courtesy of yours truly...this was taken at an army outpost I was in looking into Lebanon. if you may. * I have spoken with the Fire Commissioner himself of Israel and he assures me no... guarantees me a position in a fire department here in Israel. He didnt say where and he didnt say when only that he is in arguments with the Ministry of Finance to allocate enough money to fund an additional 135 new firefighters salaries - of which I would be one of those new ffs. Now not to be cynical or anything but this is now the 5th person to guarantee me a position in a fire department and yes even though it is the fire commissioner himself the grand poo-bah if you will Im not holding my breath. Plus if I have to wait on a Ministry of well...anything....in Israel to get up off its tukus anytime soon and spend money I may as well be 80 years old and no longer able to fight fires. Well see what happens. * It has come to my attention that I am being considered for a military contract position for firefighting in Antarctica for the upcoming season. Yes - that big block of ice that has the South Pole Tel Aviv Aerial Ladder Truck Oh my baby...I will be on you soon. and penguins all over it place at the bottom of the Earth. No I am not crazy. Ok..well maybe I am crazy. But this job will be specifically for firefighting which is my career and passion if you havent noticed and it pays between $600-650 USD/week which means that 1 week of pay down there = 1 month of rent here. It would be a 6 month post and an adventure for sure. I just filled out the 2nd step in the application process after they tell you theyre interested so perhaps this is a good sign.

On the map Colmar about 70km from the hub of Strasbourg might be easily mistaken for a sleepy little European village-town. But it is not quite what you would expect among the rural pastures of Alsace. It is spectacularly beautiful unique in its architecture interesting in its history and conveniently located. I spent a year in Strasbourg unaware of this tourist jewel so close by. Sure it had great reviews on all the travel sites but so do many other must-see places in Europe. You really have to visit it to experience its true charm and beauty. When I finally decided to spend a day in Colmar it was on a wonderfully sunny day in August. Strasbourg has several trains that take you to Colmar in 30 minutes and it costs only 25 euros including the return. As soon as I got out of the station I was greeted by the mesmerizing sky-blue water of the fountain in the stations courtyard. Several signs pointed me towards the city center centre ville which took me 25 minutes to walk to. I Statue of Liberty - 12m replica did not possess a city map nor a list of the citys attractions. So I navigated the little streets to reach the tourist office again plenty of signs and maps present on the streets. A very helpful and friendly guide provided me tourist maps and was also kind enough to explain the route to the Statue of liberty! free wifi at the tourist office You see Colmar is the birth place of Auguste Bartholdi the French sculptor who designed the Statue of Liberty. A 12m replica of Liberty now resides in a corner of the town. Unfortunately I had to catch a bus to reach itnumber 7 towards Zl Nord from the Theatre stop to Atlas Fly. The statue is present at the intersection right in front of the bus stop. It is located atop a small mound in the middle of the roundabout. Hence there is no pedestrian access to the statue unless you are a bit adventurous or the traffic is light. If you time your journey right you can catch the same bus on its way back to the centre. The tourist map lists about 30 spots taking one on a walk through the city. city centre Many of these are old buildings of historical signifance that can be viewed only from the outside such as Voltaires residence. All in all it took me less than 5 hours to complete a thorough sightseeing. Since they close by 5pm I found it best to hit the museums first. access free if you are a student in Alsace There is the Bartholdi museum with photos and drawings of several of Bartholdis designs the Unterlinden museum of art and history of the region and the natural history musuem. The Dominican church with its high ceiling and stained glass windows and the Collegiate church are also must-sees. After a spot of lunch I strolled through the bylanes and streets not marked on the tourist map. I found myself in the midst of local cheese and wine at the covered market or marche couvert. Quickly passing through the numerous stalls it was too warm a day to be at the covered market I came out the other side to the famed little Venice part of town. It was literally picture-postcard perfection Some locals ply boats along these canals but I was content to enjoy the view from a bench on the Little Venice sidewalk. I basked in the sunlight for quite a while soaking up the beautiful scene. I felt it was the perfect culmination to a perfect day. As dusk finally fell I tore myself away from the spot and slowly made my way back towards the station.

Bathurst New South Wales. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Oceania » Australia » New South Wales » Bathurst March 29th 2008 Published March 29th 2008Edit Blog Post NigWar The main purpose of our trip to Bathurst was to visit situated in the heart of Bathurst the Australian Fossil and Mineral Museum which is the home of the internationally renowned Somerville Collection. This important collection is internationally significant because it covers rare specimens from all over the world. It is housed in the 1876 Public School building which underwent major refurbishment before being fitted out with stunningly beautiful exhibitions. Close to 2000 fossil and mineral specimens are displayed in two main exhibitions. The Somerville Collection is the lifetime work of Warren Somerville and features some of the finest and rarest examples of minerals and fossils in the world. The specimens currently on display in the Museum represent about one quarter of the total Collection. Highlights from the mineral collection include crystals from over 100 Australian mine sites the worlds largest rhodonite gem crystals 2000 million years old garnets rainbow-coloured fluorites from China as well as diamonds sapphires rubies emeralds and other gems from around the world. Features of the fossil collection include Australias only complete T.rex skeleton Australias largest collection of fossils in amber fossil dinosaur eggs some of the oldest fossils of early forms of life and a large collection of Australias unique opalised fossils. I knew little about fossils and minerals but in the six hours or so that we spent in the museum I learnt far more than I ever thought possible. All the exhibits are displayed so well with descriptions written in plain English that is very easily understood. I have plagiarised the exhibition notes for this posting. It was a real pleasure to go there and we will certainly return. The photos could be better this is a public museum so I was reluctant to use a tripod similarly I avoided using flash because it can be rather annoying to other visitors and if everyone used flash it would eventually damage the exhibits. The light in the museum is ideal for viewing the exhibits direct but not ideal for photography some of these handheld pictures were taken at around one tenth of a second whilst I held my breath to avoid camera shake. I will return here because it was not until towards the end of our visit that I figured out the best way to manipulate two cameras and take the necessary notes at the same time I hope that I have the notes and captions with the correct specimens. The following photographs are just a very small sample of all those that are on display it is well worth the trip to this Museum in Bathurst you will not be disappointed. We’ll start with a picture of the Ichthyosaur skull from Richmond in Queensland. Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles which looked remarkably like modern dolphins. However the two types of animals were unrelated ichthyosaurs were reptiles which lived in the sea at the same time as the dinosaurs while dolphins are mammals which adapted to the marine habitat long after the ichthyosaurs and dinosaurs had become extinct. You might have noticed some smaller fossils displayed with the Ichthyosaur skull these are Calceolispongiidae from Carnarvon Basin in Western Australia. Sorry can’t tell you much more about them but they do look quite interesting. We now have a look at a mineral specimen this is Zincocalcite probably from Broken Hill Australia. Here we have a very rare and valuable sample of Crocoite. Warren Somerville purchased about 1000 specimens of this mineral and he found that they proved to be excellent trade material especially in Europe and the USA. This specimen is from Tasmania which is world famous for its high quality Crocoite. An Internet search will reveal that prices range from $20 to $20000 per piece. The next three although the look very different are all samples of Gypsum Celestite in Vugh from Majunga Madagasgar. I particularly like this specimen of Selenite from Chihuahua Mexico. Angelite from New Caledonia Nice colouring and pattern on this specimen of Malachite from Cobar NSW. Rather attractive Rhodochrosite with Kutnohorite from Cavnic in Romania. We’ll now return to the fossils this one is quite amazing I never expected it to be so big This is the only complete T Rex skeleton in Australia. A Nothosaur skeleton Keichousaurus hui from Guizhou Province China. This one fascinated me it’s a shoal of herring-like fish Knightia eocenae I imagine them swimming along then suddenly something happened very quickly to freeze them in time producing the wonderful fossil that we see today. This is the skull and lower jaw a giant wombat like diprotodontid found at Alcoota Station in the Northern Territory of Australia. The diprotodontid took the niche that is now assumed by elephants in Africa it was our largest mammal and was flightless. Its almost grinning at us perhaps this petrified crab or Harpactoxanthopsis quadrilobata from Monte Bolca Italy died with a smile on its face. When visiting a fossil museum a picture of a nest of dinosaur eggs is a must. These came from Henan Province China. Looks quite cuddly but the Drotops armatus is actually a Devonian insect. I thought you’d recognise this Bathyriscus fimbriatus from the Cambrian period. This is a Garpike or Lepisosteus. All over this museum you’ll find descriptions like this to illustrate just how useful some of these minerals have become Composite displays to compare different minerals from all over the world This museum has been so well thought out then planned with a lot of work going into displaying the specimens in such a way that they have become enjoyable and informative. If you ever visit Australia do visit this museum in Bathurst New South Wales you’ll thoroughly enjoy it. After the Museum we called into the Fern House in Machattie Park This was very nice but we were in for a very pleasant surprise when we walked into a building that was labelled The Begonia House”. We don’t know much about begonias and never realised that they could grow so big. There were several hundred on display but here’s just a dozen to look at Two nights but only one day in Bathurst so just a quick look around. An original Cobb & Co Stagecoach Statues wonder what they were discussing A Japanese Garden Should have written it down but we think this was called a Friendship Circle. Couldnt get any vegetarian food so nipped into Woollies for some veg and things then made our own. Just a brief visit to Bathurst the first for both of us such an interesting place that we will be back probably for at least five days. This is where gold was first discovered in New South Wales the only inland place that Charles Darwin visited and many other things that have happened in the last 180 years may not be history to some countries but it is to our very young one although the indigenous people would not agree with this statement. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Nigel Waring NigWar Retired and love travel cruising in particular and have plenty of time to do it.

It turns out according to Trip Advisor that Barcelona is ranked at the top of cities for pickpockets. Madrid comes in fourth. Rounding out the five are Rome Prague and Paris. Europe makes up eight of the top ten! Hanoi and Buenos Aires are the only cities outside of Europe on the Pick Ten. Where might you be safest? Trip Advisor says Iceland! Most cities in Japan are safe with Kyoto the safest. I agree! Less than an hour from many U.S. cities Montreal is a safe place for travelers especially the solo traveler. Ireland just a hop skip and jump from eastern cities is another safe haven for travelers of al kinds. Here at home the obvious city to avoid Peter Piper would be New York City. But older downtown areas in cities like Atlanta Los Angeles Washington DC Chicago and Detroit are home to many Peter Piper wannabees. But the main reason this article strikes out Culprits? on is the reason why Spain is prime for Mr. Piper. It is the prevalence of gypsies or gypsy-like bands of people. They quickly gather around tourists find myriad ways to distract you and even try to touch your face! During this period of distraction any number of methods are used to grab your money or passport. The most clever is making a quick slit on the bottom of your purse or backpack with a sharp blade razor or knife. The contents drop easily and quickly into waiting hands while you are distracted by the touching. Or other forms of distraction and confusion. Having been to Spain numerous times I can spot these bands of gypsies quite easily. But often they come up from behind or from the side when you least suspect them. Crowded buses and public transport are also easy pickings for them. In Rome young women are the easiest prey. Why? The tall dark and handsome Italian man often distracts young women looking for romance or at least a coffee date. However Paris and Prague utilize Crowds both methods gypsies and handsome men!! While I did not encounter issues in Hanoi or Buenos Aires I can imagine the scenario particularly in the poorer neighborhoods. A favorite ploy in Hanoi is the moto or motorbike. When you grab a cheap ride to the Opera House your back pocket is in a prime location for Peter Piper. Or in Buenos Aires they send a pretty girl wanting to teach you the tango. Fortunately I had Mr. Mike with me and they may not have been gypsies though it crossed my mind during the photo shoot and tipping process. So what do I do to prevent this from happening? I carry only about $100 in cash leave my wallet and credit cards in the hotel safe. I also carry a COPY of my passport not the real thing!!! And my pocket is secured in some fashion with a zipper preferably. Front pockets are better than back pockets. I attach a thick rubber band around my money clip to increase friction during removal. I never carry a backpack or laptop case. Anywhere! Of course it goes without saying to avoid wearing flashy jewelry and smart clothing. My trips are not fashion shows! Shoes are often a good indication of what is in your wallet. Wear comfortable but well worn shoes. And never flip flops as you will not be able to run very far or very fast in them. And your cell phone? Carry it in a pocket. Holding it in your hand staring down at the phone is the most vulnerable position possible. Pull it out only when you are sure it is safe to do so. I know that sounds obvious and rather cautious but phones are worth as much as credit cards to the right Peter Piper. Bottom line just be smart always vigilant and never get into a place or situation where you might be at risk!!! Easy for me to say but my years of travel have taught me a few things. This is one! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 15 Message Gerry Kataoka golfkat Instead of a long discourse on where I have been how about I ask you to read something I have written that might interest you.

At the same time as we were sitting in the sun reading the van had all windows open with the fan blowing air through to dry the ice from the previous night. At 345pm each day we would retreat inside again to recommence the icing process. Even so we would recommend this site for free camping but have your own porta potti for summer. There is a 48 hour limit – we stayed 72 hours! We had been so bone idle we had not even bothered to do any sightseeing or even going into Glenn Innes to buy bread or fresh vegetables preferring to live off the cruskettes and vegetables I dried using by dehydrator. We were planning on staying overnight in Merriwa but when we got there we discovered that the caravan park was right next to the highway and the caretaker was missing. As we were planning to stay somewhere and pay money to use their electricity to completely dry out the moisture on the inside of the van we chose Sunrise Cassilis to move on to a little town called Cassilis. This is a town of 110 people. The Camping ground is next to the bowling club who now manage the site. The BC opens every day from 5-7pm minimum and they serve meals on Friday nights. Darn we were there on Thursday. You have to go to the BC to pay. We were early so hooked ourselves up to a powered site and set up all the water etc. We had electricity water brand new toilet and shower block with hot water grassed site all for $10 a night. Highly recommended. We had the place to ourselves. We worked out how to use our reverse cycle air conditioner and set it to the minimum of 16c for overnight imagining that we would be having the minus minimum temperature issues of the past few days. Woke up to find that the minimum appeared to have been 14.2c. But there was no condensation inside which was a bonus. When I wandered outside I came across the most beautiful sunrise photo is attached. As we prepared to leave we noticed black clouds heading towards us. Of yes the last Sofala 1 250 kms to Perthville were done through horrible rain mist etc. It is not fun travelling along minor roads up and down windy hilly road in these conditions with large trucks trying to force you to go faster and all the signs saying things like slippery when wet or slippery when icy. Some of the bends in the roads were very sharp indeed. We stopped in a tiny town called Sofala for lunch where we had steak sandwiches and I relished a pot of tea inside the small general store which was lovely and warm. Outside it was about 8c and miserable. Interesting little gold mining ghost town with some wonderful run down buildings. There are lots of free camping sites along the river very close to the town. We will be back to revisit. All the way the scenery was exceptional. Finally we found our way to Mudgee didn’t recognise the names of any of the wineries and on to Perthville and Dave and Shirley’s house. Lovely to catch up with friends it has been 7 years since we saw them in the flesh. They now live on top of a hill in rural splendour Sofala 2 on 15 acres and have 360 degree views. Fabulous . Saturday we lined up and watched Dave and Shirley open up their brand new Cub Supermatic Drover camper. The manuals for these things are not quite Chinglese but they come close. It is now sitting in splendour on their back lawn and being wet down on a regular basis to cure the canvas to stop it leaking later on. We explored porta potties¸ and have been showing them the set up we have with a media centre and hard drives which contain our movies and TV shows. The boys have spent time talking software and how to set the whole thing up. Later Dave took us for a drive around Mount Panorama where they hold the motor races. People actually live along the track. The bends and turns are frightening¸ how the drivers keep their nerve is beyond me. The view from the top is beautiful. Today Sunday when I woke up and opened the blind I found another magic sunrise here at Perthville 9 kms from Bathurst. Later we went off to BCF Bunnings and Supercheap Auto to purchase a variety of items mainly for My name is Sam Dave and Shirley. Before departing the dog Sam was locked into his pen with a large marrow bone which he insisted on showing us with glee. Then on to Lucknow so GMan could get some new ugg boots. His are coming apart. He wouldn’t agree to a purchase of a hot pink lambs wool for Fray’s bed. I would have gotten an electric blue one for Ratty as well. We lunched at a former Cobb and co inn at Vittoria before returning to rural bliss. I of course was wandering around with my eyes shut and managed to trip over a hose pipe and came down heavily on my right knee back of my right hand and my NOSE. I have scratches but am fine. Hopefully the nose will clear up quickly. What I managed to do was to break two of the glasses in our wineglass holder I was bringing to show Shirley because they dont bang together and break in the van! Off to Holly Jean and Alias on Tuesday. Sounds like Barunduda is also very cold. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 13 Displayed 13 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Christine Bolvig Bolarks Young at heart and heading out to see parts of Australia we have dreamed about for years........ full info Joined May 13th 2012 Trips 5 Last Login June 2nd 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 72 Guestbook 256 Photos 1448 Forum Posts 1 blog=725679 blogger=239485 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=725679 blogger=239485 Advertisement Brief history of Australia Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century.

We did not see much evidence of this. Cracks in buildings mostly  but you would have to look for them.The resilience and attitude of the people in Japan is amazing. Cleanlyness is der rigor as well. Washing the store fronts streets the bathrooms are spotless and everywhere. We had to eat cow tongue. Its everywhere. Cows have no moos here and I know why! Everyone eats their tongues. I am speechless. The tongues were sliced thin as if shaven. You could have them in a bowl with rice and sauce or in a ball shaped dipped in batter. What happens to the rest of the cow? They also have ox tongue which we never found. Curious  that curry is also popular. In Sendai our hotel was a 5 minute walk from the train station so it was easy peasyas they say. That first night we walked the market area and discovered a huge electronic shop. It had everything but what I needed! You would think the camera section was big but you would be wrong. Cell phone area however  was quite large. I was Fukuurajima Bridge looking for a battery pack for the 4S Iphone but because it was an out dated phone they no longer carried them. Oh well Charging more frequently is what I will have to do. It was weird as well seeing all the control buttons on the appliances in Japanese. Whats a guy to do if i lived here? As well now I know what it is like to be illiterate. BTW All the coffee you can drink in this hotel. Highly recommended. Its called the Richmond. Yum Yum. Next day we took an excursion to Matsushima in Sendai Bay. After we arrived we paid a pedestrian toll for a foot bridge to cross over to an Island in the Bay. Nothing special except quietude and paths and a beach or two that you can walk on. We decided afterwards to go eat oysters and that is what we did! They were so tasty. They were huge. WE had three each. They were steamed just right. Next we took a boat into the bay. On the boat we decided to climb upto the top deck. There we had a birds eye view of the surroundings. Some people Feeding the Birds on the boat were attracting seagulls with food and as a result the sea gulls were face to face nibbling out of the hand of the feeders while in flight. We were asked to pay 300Yen to stay on the top deck. We refused! We already paid 1400 Yen each for the tour. WE went below to the next deck and were told that we could only be on the bottom deck! Rippoff!!! Argh. The bay reminded us of Vietnams Halong Bay with the islands dotting the scenery. The boat tour lasted about an hour and landed us in another town where we were able to get on another train and head back to Sendai for the evening. Next day was a transit day. We headed towards the North into the Akita Prefecture. This is a spa ski resort area. Our Ryokan has sulphur baths private male or female. Choice was ours. Hmmmm... I think private. Our ryokan is nestled against a hillside deep in the woods and is somewhat rustic with some roofs made of straw like what we experienced on our last trip here. Supper was a feasty affair with a fire pit. In the pit on sticks Rock in the Bay were 2 fish skewered as if they cooked there. We also had a rod hanging from the ceiling that supports a pot of soup. We had it all. We ate and ate and ate. BurpThats supposed to be polite telling our hosts that we were well content with the meal. We got up to another feast in the fire pit at 730 AM. We were full for the day. We decided to spend the day walking around the area we were in as well as spa-inglol. Thats the lingo I came up with. On our walk we hit some boardwalks water rapids and nature. It finally felt like I was on vacation. Supper was at the fire pit again. No shortage of eats thats for sure.

After a bit of flailing about the room in the dark with a phone flashlight we found the thermostat and put the air on. It did such a good job of cooling down the room neither of us wanted to get out from under the covers. Finally around 945 we drug our butts out and down to breakfast. Hilton offered a fantastic blend of local and US type breakfast foods. We both had huge plates of fruit. I rounded out my course with two churros and chocolate. While Alex went a more health conscious route. Energized we snagged our stuff from the room and headed out. First stop off the day Segrada Familia was a couple metro changes away. Luckily we expected to us the metro regularly and got a 3 day pass. The area around the church was packed with tourist. We had some time to kill so began wandering around for pictures of the church and then the park. At the back of the park were multiple groups of experienced adults playing bocce ball. The game we watched grandma 20190323_075600 beat out all the guys playing with her. We hung in the shade until our assigned enterance time. We were admitted at 1145 gathered our audio guides and began to explore the Segrada Familia. Alex had not done any research so was just in awe of the architecture and surprised by the space inside. I was amazed at how much the building had progressed since my last visit in 2004. I remembered being restricted to a specific path around the place because of all the construction going on including the inside. Now we were able to just explore basically wherever we wanted to go. Being there at noon was perfect because all the stained glass shown equally bright and didnt distract us from the amazing architecture. Luckily we took so long to explore we were able to see the glass start to splash its color along the ceiling and pillars. We concluded our visit with an elevator ride up a tower on the Nativity Facade then walked our way down snapping great close up pictures of the exterior and view. Alex liked to remind me that he had a healthy understanding of heights not that he was afraid of 20190323_073518 them. Done with our tour we still took some time to walk around the church museum in the basement seeing some interesting background information on how it was built and got to get close to Gaudis tomb in the crypt we only got to view through glass on the main floor. After a quick browse through the gift shop I drug Alex around the entire exterior for pictures. He peaked into many souvenir shops to see if we could find a good idea for our travel shelf. Back to the metro we headed to shopping at Las Ramblas. Most of the shopping turned out to be food. Gelato to walk down the street. Then many treats at La Boquerilla market filled with food stalls with fun samples from meats to fruits to olives. I nibbled on a cheese and meat mix while Alex inhailed a chorizo burrito and empanada. Tired from all the walking we sat outside at a nearby restaurant for a large sangria and delicious cheesecake dessert. Filled up we continued to stroll down the rest of Las Ramblas. At the end I redirected us towards the Montjuic area. Unfortunately for Alex that meant climbing a 20190323_123930 bunch of stairs because I read the map wrong and the cable car I thought we would be taking was actually a metro that is under construction so we walked to the park requiring stairs. At the top huffing and puffing we rested on a bench while viewing the city from above. Then we sought out the actual cable car for a ride up to the castle. The castle was a much more impressive version of the fort in Saint Augustine FL we saw for my birthday last year. While it was a similar style obviously the Spanish built the one in FL the Castle had more square footage and much more impressive walls. The fire power had been updated over time as well. Something both did have in common would be their incredible view. You could see the Barcelona port where ships of many sizes including cruises came to port. Exhausted by this point we finished watching the archers on ground practice then headed back out on the cable car. The thought was to take the metro back to the hotel however the line from Montjuic back to the city was under construction. Instead we had to 20190323_093032 catch a bus back. While on the bus ride Alex decided it wasnt worth going back to then come over to the front of Montjuic for the fountain show. So took the metro to the fountain instead of the hotel. I wanted to see if they had the show times displayed nearby so we passed the design University having some show to the fountain. Unfortunately no posted times. Luckily there were concession stands to sit for a drink and snacks. A water and half a hot dog later our obvious hunger meant we needed something more substantial. We headed back the way we came to an Arena which turned out to be a mall for options. We stopped at a tapas place for food and you guessed it sangria. Timing was perfect. After the check we made our way back to the fountain... or close. The area was packed with people there to see the Magic Fountain. So we stopped to watch from the bridge for an easy get away. The sprays of water synchronized with music for a twenty minute show. It was almost as cool to watch on fellow viewers phones as in person. Which I had 20190323_094544 to do some of as they stick their arms up in front of me to film. We did mistake the end of the first song as the end of the show so moved positions part way through but enjoyable just the same. Done we hustled to the metro and to the hotel. By this point Alex was struggling his knees ankles and legs were sore. What probably didnt help was the mild stomach bug impacting him yesterday and today. Tough to keep liquids in him. It lead to a rough night sleep for the poor guy. He even got up to do yoga on the middle of the night to try and help. « Previous Entry Additional photos below Photos 10 Displayed 10 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Bobbi Wendorff bwendorff Joined May 21st 2017 Trips 2 Last Login September 10th 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 57 Guestbook 0 Photos 451 Forum Posts 0 blog=1032114 blogger=370342 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1032114 blogger=370342 Advertisement Brief history of Spain Spains powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England.

Id decided I needed somewhere for a few nights to read up on my onward journey and get used to being back on my own and Port Stephens fitted the bill. Its a beautiful inlet blessed with several pretty beaches a resident pod of dolphins and some immense sand dunes. I found a hostel with wooden cabins set in the forest which was the perfect base to sit back and unwind. A resident kookaburra would visit the outdoor eating area each day and the charming owners lit us a camp fire on my first night there so I settled down with a stubby next to the flames and chatted the night away with a group of fellow travellers. I spent the next day visiting some of Port Stephens beaches but theyre mainly for families and were quite busy so I went on a quick dolphin-watching cruise in the bay to see some of the hundred or so bottlenose dolphins who call the bay home. Sadly the weather turned just after Photo 16 Someones got the right idea... lunch so I decided to head north to my next planned stop Bellingen. Bellingen sits at the eastern end of a road called the Waterfall Way in a region known as New England. If you dont like landscape photographs then look away now... the Waterfall Way winds its way past a cluster of world heritage listed national parks through a stunning high altitude pass and some gorgeous rolling scenery. And of course a lot of waterfalls! Bellingen is a small attractive town with one main street lined with colonial era wooden shops and a grand old hotel. It backs onto the Bellinger River and my hostel was located on the edge of town with a view down to the riverbanks. To me it was the epitome of chilled... a large verandah had comfy chairs and a pool table overlooking the garden which offered hammocks and more chairs. A local colony of flying foxes visited the neighbouring trees in the evening filling the sky with their large bat-like silhouettes. After the long drive from Port Stephens I settled into a hammock and watched the stars come out in the company of several mozzies and the hostels resident hens. My Photo 2 The grand Ebor Falls first visit was to Dorrigo National Park protected for the world because of its unique rainforest. Sadly floods in 2009 still not repaired... come on guys!! had cut off most of the longer bushwalking tracks in the park but a brilliantly named track called the Wonga Walk set out from the main visitors centre winding its way through the rainforest via two waterfalls - Tristiana and Crystal Shower. The rainforest was beautiful... a vibrant world of greens filled with exotic bird calls some like car alarms others like monkeys... all of the birds hidden from view high up in the canopy. Luckily there was enough wildlife on the ground to compensate as wild wallabies padamelons and turkeys jumped and strutted their way through the undergrowth. The falls were small but pretty and even though the path is metalled I felt at times like I was back in Borneo having to hack my way through several times I wish Id had my machete!. After lunch at one of the great viewpoints I headed back to Bellingen and relaxed on the verandah with my book and a cup of coffee and a Chunky Kit-Kat... thanks Honky!. The next day I decided Photo 19 The lighthouse at Cape Byron to tackle more of the Waterfall Way which extends about 180km to Armidale in the west. I decided this was too far but drove first to Ebor Falls a spectacular blip on the Guy Fawkes River where the water cascades down two large drops. From there I drove along a gravel track to Point Lookout in the New England National Park. The lookout itself was impressive but the bushwalk down into the forest and out to a viewpoint called Wrights Lookout was nothing short of magical... pure Lord of the Rings stuff on a path so unfrequented that I was clearing spiders webs practically every few seconds! I arrived at Wrights Lookout a rocky promontory covered with low scrub to find myself alone to enjoy a panorama of thick untouched rainforest alive with flocks of parrots and other wonderful birds whose bizarre calls were the only sound. Its one of the magical things about Australia that on a gorgeous sunny day you can walk on your own through a world heritage forest not too many hours drive from several major cities. I had lunch while enjoying the vista then completed the walk back to Point Lookout seeing a few beautiful Photo 17 Looking north along Byron Bay lyrebirds on the way and drove back along the Waterfall Way to the hostel. The next morning it was time to head on north to Byron Bay my last stop in New South Wales. More down time but of a different kind! Byron is set on a gorgeous beach and my hostel was just 100 metres from it. So I spent a happy few days walking the beach and swimming in the surf letting those Pacific Ocean waves wake me up after a few heavy nights! I hooked up with another traveller Nathan on the first night so spent most of the time with him including hiking up to Cape Byron the easternmost point of Australia and its lighthouse in the full heat of the day. Id heard that Byron was a bit of a hippy hangout but I think those days are long gone and nowadays its home to a young crowd of surfers and sun worshippers... more naff clubs and ID than bangles and crystals. On our last night we went out with a pair of Chilean guys Guillermo and Thomas who were just beginning a 12-month trip similar to mine... I have to say I was Photo 8 just a bit jealous! Truth be told I could have stayed longer but I realised that my time was ticking by and I still had a lot of distance to cover. So onwards to Brisbane! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 18 Displayed 18 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 16 Message Jonathan Smith SmithyWorldWide I work as a town planner in London and have always enjoyed travelling.

So much has happened Im not sure I can properly recall everything but here it goes... I last left off the day we went to the market for the first time. Its called La Boqueria and is amazing/completely insane. They have rows and rows of stands with fruits veggies nuts candy ice cream empanadas pastries cured meats bars... I mean just about anything you can think of consuming and every row is completely packed with people trying to taste all the best items. Im pretty positive that none of the stands would have passed any food inspection I would have done back home but everything I ate was so good I tried to ignore that fact. Ive come to learn that everyone just lives by different rules in Europe most of which I am very okay with especially the one where you can buy alcohol and just walk around in public drinking it so I just roll with it 😊 The market took up the majority of that day because there was so much to see/eat. One thing I had no idea about is how popular IMG_6310 La Boqueria jamon cured ham is here. There were so many stands/shops selling meat cups or meat on a stick and although that sounds kinda gross they are probably some of the most common items to see people walking around with. That night we went to Bilbao Berria a restaurant in the Gothic area recommended to me by a friend and the style of food is called Pinxtos. They are kinda like tapas but are all individually sized and served in buffet form. You keep the stick from each one you eat and at the end they total them up for the cost of the meal. Each one is just under 2 euro so its very reasonable. The majority of them came on bread so it was a little heavy but I did not try one thing I didnt like there. We drank our first Albarino of the trip there and Im coming to find that it is difficult to order a wine I do not like over here. The next day we had plans to go to Park Guell and architectural garden designed by Antoni Gaudi. So we woke up early and metroed/walked the 4 miles there only to to find IMG_6311 La Boqueria out that all the tickets for the entrance times until 7 that night had already been sold. That completely threw us off and while we made the trip back to our apartment we decided it was a good time to look into getting the tattoos we had been thinking about. In Florence there are different versions of a little black silhouette holding a red balloon all over the city. They are done by an artist referred to as Banksy but no one really knows who does them for sure. Since we felt such a strong attachment to Florence we both wanted to get Banksys artwork as a reminder and symbol of such an special trip. We were able to find a great place close to us that had good reviews/prices and got our permanent souvenirs... they only hurt a little 😉 Of course the next day when we wanted to go back to Park Guell it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting. It was our last day to be able to see this famous park so we busted out our umbrellas and went any way. The rain was slightly miserable but Park Guell is gorgeous and the architecture along IMG_6312 La Boqueria with the mosaics are really a sight to see. Well worth the trip even with the terrible weather. That evening we had our best meal in Spain. It was at El Merendero Della Mari a restaurant that was recommended to us because of their paella and was right on the beach in Barceloneta. Obviously we ordered the seafood paella and it was as just good as we were told it would be but we also had the best seafood croquettes Ive ever had. After dinner we went to one of the more popular clubs in Port Olympic called Opium which was fun and interesting as all the European clubs have been so far. We left around 3 am to head back to the apartment but there happened to be a casino next door to the club so we made a quick pit stop there first. Gina actually had pretty good luck on a couple of the machines and won about 200 euro I had absolutely no luck and cut my losses after 50 euro. Our last day together was low key did some shopping drank some cava Spanish champagne then got ready to head to our Flameco show in El IMG_6365 Pinxtos Poble Espanyol. This Iberian village is about the size of the main strip of dt campbell so relatively small but has all sorts of small shops restaurants and workshops along with tons of eye catching architecture. The show started at 930 pm and there were tapas served before. For being a set menu and not very expensive the food and sangria were awesome but the show itself was better than we could have imagined. The dancers are beautiful and the speed in which they move their feet while continuing to look so graceful but intense at the same time is mind boggling. Gina and I were completely mesmerized during the one hour show and did not want it to end. We went home right after the show so she could pack and prepare for her journey home then this morning we said our tearful goodbyes. I am so thankful to have had her spend these last three weeks with me and will never forget all the adventures we had. Now I have a couple days alone in Spain then am off to Dubrovnik.

Secondly Bellingen is awesome! I could quite happily stay here. Forever. We arrived on Thursday afternoon and after a much needed lunch feast went for a cycle around the town which lies on the not-quite-spelled-the-same Bellinger River. The different spelling seems to have been the result of a misinterpretation of poor handwriting somewhere along the line. While out cycling I was catapulted back into ‘reality’ when received a call inviting me to be a panel member at a conference in Melbourne in November. I must say work is so far removed from my mind at the moment and it was a nice feeling to say fanx but no fanx - Back in travel mode I decided that Bellingen has the loveliest ever vibe. It’s laid-back the locals are friendly the countryside surrounding it is stunning and probably best of all there’s a divine organic grocer selling everything from food and toiletries to delicious treats and mojito ice lollies! You can tell there 120427e is a strong community spirit and an onus on protecting the environment and living sustainably. But here it comes effortlessly and easily. As we are no longer on the coast and therefore can’t make use of beach showers we have been staying at a camping spot in the local showground. Our lovely camping neighbours and hot showers have been very welcome! On Friday we headed out past Dorrigo to explore the beautiful Australian Gondwana Rainforests. The skywalk on which you can view the rainforest from the treetops is pretty cool. We then went on a great hike along the Wonga Walk past the Crystal Shower Falls there’s a little path behind the waterfall that you sneak along and the Tristania Falls named after the original name of a local plant. It was an absolutely beautiful walk – the perfect opportunity to soak up a big dose of peace and to admire the native flora and fauna including all sorts of species of birds and a few brush turkeys. My favourites were the ‘walking stick palms’ with their dangling bright red berries and the green canopies created by the stinging tree leaves. They’re lovely to 120427g look at but apparently the leaves are covered in tiny stinging hairs so definitely one to watch and not touch. Before heading back to Bellingen we went to see the amazing Dangar Falls and on our way back we stopped in at the Old Butter Factory which is a little community of shops galleries a woodcraft studio a leather factory a complimentary therapy centre and a café. In the evening we went in search of some nightlife and found plenty of it. There were three venues with live music and we chose the Federal Hotel ie the pub and listened to the mellow tunes of Alex Hallahan & The Woodland Hunters. As it turned out they are actually a Melbourne based band and are currently on their ‘Human Veins’ tour. Some of their songs reminded me of James Blunt’s music. Bellingen has a strong focus on the arts and is home to numerous festivals. Sadly there weren’t any on while we were there but we did pretty well soaking up the local flavour. A number of movies have been shot here and the latest Bellingen-set flick was supposed to be Eucalyptus starring Nicole Kidman 120427m and Russell Crowe… but apparently that fell through. This morning we were lucky to have the weekly growers’ market come to the Showground just 50m from our camping spot! It’s one of those markets that you could spend all day at – sampling shopping chatting – and I came away with a full bag of veggies and produce including some delicious roast pumpkin hummus and sundried tomato / walnut pesto. Yum! The next few hours were spent ‘doing the shops’ of Bellingen. I worked my way up one side and down the other side of Hyde Street the main drag. Almost every café was also a gallery and vice versa. Even the supermarket caters to Bellingen’s foodie style with a generously sized deli section and specialist products. The Bellingen Emporium which is housed in the historic Hammond & Wheatley building looks like a dusty old department store from the outside but is a real find. It sells luxury garments leather goods etc and the upper floor is dedicated to gorgeous handmade jewellery as well as middle eastern inspired interiors. Lovely! The restaurants of Bellingen are something else altogether. Some of them 120427t are fully organic and almost all of them have a menu that makes you salivate on the spot and an atmosphere/décor that prompts you to mentally redecorate your own home. We took it fairly easy this the afternoon as I’ve been feeling a bit crook and poor Dean has somehow hurt his back a pinched nerve but being Saturday unfortunately no chiros or osteos are open. Also the rain had set in again!. The most energetic thing we did today was go for a walk down to Bellingen Island. Although it looks like it used to be an island we’re not convinced it actually still is one. It is however the largest remnant of lowland rainforest left in the lower Bellinger flats and it’s home to strangler figs white booyong pepperberry trees and giant stinging trees. It is also inhabited by an enormous number of grey-headed flying foxes. When you look up at the trees they are literally everywhere! An information sign warned us that ‘bombing’ is a possibility in the mornings when the bats have full bellies and need to empty themselves in order to make themselves as light as possible. Apparently if you see one 120428b turning itself upside down to hang from its thumbs that’s a sign to get out of there! They certainly are quite a sight and fun to watch. I walked a little further on out of town and was again struck by the beautiful surrounding countryside. It’s right on your doorstep no matter which part of town you live in. The very lush and tropical native plants are also a reminder that we are getting closer to the north coast. Tomorrow morning we head north to Coffs Harbour. I reeeeally don’t want to leave but then we have probably seen and done all there is and unless we were to get work and stay for a while it’s probably time to move along. After some searching I did manage to find a house sitting position but alas it’s not available until mid June. A real shame as it’s a four bedroom property on an acre of land bordering the river with veggie patches a small rainforest to provide bird habitat a small pond with frogs 2 dogs 2 cats 5 quails and 6 chickens as well as a separate studio ideal for playing music or doing meditation/yoga! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Jackie & Dean TeamJD We are two skydivers and yogis who love to travel explore and experience new things.

What time of year did you visit Bello and for how long? Did you encounter sand flies? The reason I am asking is because I would like to get some honest first-hand feedback on the cons of living in Bellingen. We have only visited for a few days at a time and are now wanting to relocate there. We left Queensland because of the heat midges and wind and would so like to be properly informed before going ahead with our decision. Many thanks in anticipation of your reply Linda 1st November 2017 TeamJD Jackie & Dean Bellingen Hello Linda how intriguing - I have just lately been thinking of Bellingen - very fondly! We didnt have any issues with sandflies or midges while we were there. Possibly this had to do with the time of year? I did hear that it can get very hot but nothing that some good aircon couldnt solve. And theres an outdoor swimming pool or there was when we were there which is open during the summer only. Lots of luck and hope you enjoy!

The air conditioning in the compact and clean room was sufficient to be comfortable as I rested on the bed. Once the light had begun I was up and into my exercise clothes and out the door to an exercise area I had discovered by chance yesterday. The park was about 1 kilometre in circumference and their appeared to be an occasional exercise station that had equipment…see photo. Some people ran it and some walked some used headphones. Dotted around the park were singular people of both sexes sleeping. One a man in uniform was laid out on newspaper. Another a woman who I had seen begging in the streets yesterday and who had burns over most of her body was still sleeping using a small suitcase as her headrest and little else. A young man wearing only trousers who had come prepared with a sleeping mat was also fast asleep. As I walked past the vans and cars on the side of the road on my way back from my walk I Pathway at Jim Thompson Museum saw more men sleeping in their vehicles in a variety of poses or should I say repose. Early morning is slow in Bangkok. The people seem to start late with many places not opening until 10 or 10.30 and then staying open until midnight. Ah the power of group activities. I decided to visit Jim Thompsons’ house. I missed the tour at 1100 baht and ended up going on my own only to find that the cost of the taxi was 65 baht and entry to the museum 100 baht. WHAT A SAVING He was an American very influential in the lives of the Thai people who came to this country after the war and made his home here. He was very involved in the silk trade and established a business in Bangkok. He built what appears to be a compound which involved constructing more than one house together to make an environment that worked for him. He could move from his bedroom to dining and kitchen without having to leave the house. This is a rare feature of accommodation in Thailand. Each room was separated with barriers requiring you to step over them just like in a large Jim Phompson Museum boat. The guide said this was to protect young children from leaving the room. The presentation of art and antiques was considerable and reflected Jim Thompsons’ interests in other places such as China and Burma. It seems that one of the reasons why Jim Thompson became so famous was to do with the King of Siam…or was it something to do with the movie…not sure as the guide was a bit hard to understand. Anyway Jim Thompson mysteriously disappeared on a visit to a friend in Malaysia. He went out for a walk and never returned. He had no children but there is an organisation that has kept his business interests running since his disappearance. Certainly the place is serene beautifully kept and well visited and a great museum for the visitors to Thailand. There was a lovely art display upstairs at the Jim Thompson Museum called Art on the Farm” and I thought of you Di and wondered if you would be able to use some of the ideas for your floral art. The photo of the centrepiece was just beautiful and done with silk hanks that felt hard or soft. As you can see from the photo Big fish at the Museum it is uniquely stupendous. The pumpkins were amazing too and almost like a Halloween exercise in carving. As they said though that once the pumpkins were carved they no longer lasted instead withered and died. After leaving the museum II wandered off down the street wondering what to do next and thinking where I was. I stopped in front of the sign that gave the skytrain station stops and was checking it out when a Thai lady came up and started telling me where I was…as if I didn’t now. LOL. She asked if I was interested in shopping and I said I was so she suggested I walk with her and she would take me to an amazing shopping centre. Oh yes! I had been scammed. Next thing I am being directed into a Gem Factory and Store. The assistants hovered over me whilst I travelled around the room of gems looking but reminding myself that I WOULD NOT BUY! I tried to make a quick getaway and headed out what I thought was the exit only to discover that the exit was much less assessable. I spotted the same woman later on after leaving the real” shopping Me at the Museum centre. She was obviously waiting for her next victim. It is amazing the lengths the Thai people go to get tourists to spend their dollar. The shopping centre I entered was enormous and was about 7 floors high and at least 500metres long on each floor. I finally figured out where the food was and made it to the food court on the 6th floor where there was food of every nationality waiting for me to choose. In the end I had sweet and sour chicken and although the assistant ripped be off for 20baht I still really enjoyed the meal. Actually I then decided I would try something else and opted for a spicy mince dish with beans in it only let down by the fact that it was not hot enough temperature wise. To finish off I had a banana flavoured pikeletie thing and felt so full I left some of it behind. Now the hard part was being able to leave the building as the elevators were not always clearly marked but eventually I managed to find the level that had the skytrain on it and the National Stadium. To get from the National Stadium Art on the Farm station to Victory Monument station meant changing trains. This time I was a little confused and after leaving the station I could not figure out which direction to head in. I spoke to a motor bike rider and he suggested I cross the road and head in the right. Never being sure that the Thai know what you are trying to achieve I thought I should take him at his word as it would only mean a slightly longer walk if he was wrong. As I walked in the heat I saw landmarks that I had previously seen but felt I had been moving in the opposite direction at the time but I decided to be steadfast and keep going and sure enough the All seasons Hotel appeared 100 metres down the road. From the hotel I arranged a taxi to take me and my bags to Viengtai Hotel that turned out to be quite close to China town. The street was full of people bars restaurants and massage parlours. After a beer at the bar down the road I decided that I felt ready for a massage and had determined that this time it would be an Lovely art oil massage. The cost was 250baht for an hour and some young 22 year old man/boy was delegated to look after me. I was taken into a private air conditioned room and stripped off to just my undies keeping my modesty intact. The massage and the money were definitely worth it. An hour later I felt really relaxed and ready to take part in the next stage of my journey which was the start of the Intrepid Tour. Back at the hotel I discovered my room mate who was already lying on the bed. I had met her earlier on a quick visit to the pool and she had shared she was from NZ but we had not realised at that stage that we would be rooming together. It is such a funny world. After a further chat I headed off to the pool for a cool swim but actually it was very warm…still the breeze helped and in the end I felt a little refreshed. We had our first Intrepid meeting at 6.30 and met all but one of our fellow travellers. There are eight of us all together. The guide and me of course. Then there Pumpkin Art is a rather large built Australian guy called Harold who is a farmer outside of Perth Tracey an Australian lady of Asian descent who works in Sinapore for a big banking corporation Emma a student from Chichester and her boyfriend Casper who works for the student union at a university in Chichester Thomas a student who is studying history and is Swiss and his girlfriend Kathleen who is a nurse last but not least there is Stuart a red head from Aberdeen who works on an oil rig in the middle east and who has one month on and one month off and has been doing this for about 10 years. So this is our family for the next two weeks. We headed out to tea to get to know each other better but before we went Sar the Thai guide gave us the run down on what we could expect to happen and what we needed to be prepared for for the next little while. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Lynnie LynnieVaughan Hi Everyone or should I say the lucky few who will be able to access my travelling blog.

Its been a whale of a semester. So much change so much growth... why does growing seem to always hurt so much? Here is an essay for public essay One night a couple of weeks ago I made an emergency beer run to Tops. I had never been to Tops before and so after grabbing the beer and returning to the front to pay I was shocked to find that none of the check out lines were open. There were no cashiers there were no customers there were no high schoolers placing the items in bags. There was not a soul in sight. After prowling up and down the main corridor I realized that the grey machines by the entrance had replaced the traditional check out line. A quick reading of the illustrated steps drawn on the front of the machine revealed that I was expected to scan and bag my own items. Then I was expected to insert cash into this monstrosity as if buying a metrocard. I wouldn’t get to flirt with the young check out girls or make jokes with the man in front of me in line. I wouldn’t get to call the cashier by her first name taking advantage of the name tag of course or complain about inflating prices. Standing alone in front of this humungous box and hearing the fluorescents tick above me I felt alone. An existential dread came over me as I looked around at the empty aisles and stacked displays of discount cereal. I may have never felt so empty. I attributed it to these newfangled impersonal machines. But I had no alternative. The focus groups had spoken and so I had to get on with it I had to figure out how to use this contraption and get out with my beer and my sanity. I looked all over the box of beer for the bar code. I finally found it hiding in the bottom corner and scanned it. Having failed to have it read I scanned it again and saw the contraption blink out the total. As I went to my wallet to pay an older woman with dyed blonde hair and a forehead laced with wrinkles came to the supervising booth in the middle of the four self-check out machines where I imagine she was supposed to be all along. She looked down at the desk and began fiddling with the drawer. I walked past her but stopped just as I was about to reach the doors. Why do they have these self-checkouts?” I asked her over the beer that I cradled against my chest. Huh?” she replied. From her tone she might as well have said Go away.” Why do they have these things?” I repeated. I like having cashiers to talk to.” She shrugged and turned forward again placed her two elbows on the desk and rested her head in her hands. I went through the door and have not been back to Tops since. Usually I relish going to the supermarket. On the one hand I am a glutton and so I love being surrounded by food. But on the other hand the supermarket is a place where I always have a reason to engage my fellow shoppers in conversation. Since the aisles are continually being moved around and my memory was never very good I am often left without a clue as to where the less common items such as grated coconut or prune juice are. And so this gives me a reason to ask my fellow customers. Even if they dont know it gives me an opportunity to joke to look them in the eyes to connect. But I find that more and more we do our utmost to avoid situations where we need the help of others. The self-checkout seems like independence. Yet this apparent independence is robbing us our ability to connect. Built into the American myth is the idea that to depend upon another person is a sign of weakness. Our culture constantly heralds the glory of the individual. But as the saying goes The self-made man tends to worship his own creator. Feeling like the creator the titan around whose actions life revolves is perhaps a useful conception for getting rich. But it can also make one unmindful of the ways in which we are connected to others and the world around us. To make ones life by ones self is heroic it is epic and ultimately it is both a distortion of fact and a quick recipe for unhappiness. Think of a CEO of a large company. I imagine that he would have worked hard- overtime sleeping in the office etc.- to get to the top. And I can imagine this man both claiming to have made it on his own and instructing his son on the importance of networking. But all along the way he was helped by others. For the truth is that at all times we are engaged in a web of connections without whose tug we would not only be alone but die. We probably do not grow the food we eat or stitch our own clothes. As I look around my room I see that my shoes are made in China and my television is from Taiwan. My shirt is from the United Kingdom and the clementines that I ate this morning are from Argentina. Yet often we think we are operating fully by ourselves that we rely on no one that we are self-sufficient. This error in perception comes I believe from the lessening of personal contact. It used to be that you saw where your food was grown you saw the mill where it was refined and you knew the baker whose labors resulted in the bread that sat at your table. It used to be that you knew the butcher and saw him hacking off the neck of a squawking chicken. If you needed shoes you went to the cobbler if you needed clothes you went to the tailor. In a sense you knew that to survive you needed these people amongst whom you lived. If there was a famine not only the baker and the miller would suffer but so would everyone else. If the tailor died and didn’t have an apprentice then you might have to learn how to stitch your own shirts. In understanding the degree to which our survival is hinged upon the flourishing of others those who lived in self-sufficient communities appreciated each other more. This is not to say that we should drop all of our commitments secure of a patch of land and return to the past. Rather if we first see the ways in which our prosperity is dependent upon external often unseen factors we are left with a humility that admits our own frailty. If you invincible then there is no reason to rely on others. But if you admit to your own weakness then you can have compassion for the falls of others and create relationships to which you can turn if you fall yourself. Living in this world in which we are removed from our food sources and modes of production I find it usual to practice making ourselves vulnerable. It is for this reason that I enjoy being lost. Whenever I go to a gas station and ask for directions people jump at the chance to help just as I do for those who are lost in my neighborhood. Perhaps this quick interaction feels good because of the infrequency with which we are given the opportunity to help. In buying our books online we may save a little money and a couple minutes of time but something is lost. Getting books at the bookstore especially the local ones we wind up finding other intriguing titles and asking the proprietor for advice. The last time I went to the local bookstore in Ithaca I bought a couple of Steinbeck novels. Frank the man at the register with a neatly groomed black mustache and a short cropped black crew cut happened to be a serious Steinbeck aficionado. And so without even intending to I learned more about Steinbeck an idol of mine than I would have from the novel I had just bought. There is no substitute at least as far as I can see for one on one face to face conversation. We have tried to replicate it through chatrooms and online games through dating services and phones. We have attempted to bring people together through Facebook and myspace over blogs and online forums. But they must be auxiliaries to the communities upon whose ground the real kind not that of virtual reality our feet walk. There is a story of an African tribe who knew little of the modern outside world. One day an outsider came to them and after learning their language decided to bring them a television. For the entire first day the whole town gathered around this set enraptured by the pictures. But when the outsider woke up the next morning he found that the television had been discarded. After enquiring he heard from person after person that they already had a village storyteller and that the box could never take the place of a human. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message nathan nbell1 Tell us a bit about yourself... this information will appear on your page.... full info blog=353097 blogger=24687 Blog Map Print Version 10th December 2008 catie non-member comment ah thanks! thanks for this nate. its such a good christmas-time message also. I was so excited yesterday when a woman asked me where 79th street was. Then I was elated when she revealed she was actually looking for the american museum of natural history. Ah a chance to prolong this short conversation for a few more seconds! this essay brings up a lot of interesting ideas- from globalization and business and development and how these things affects each of us on a personal emotional level to the impact of gender dynamics. I can easily say that when Im in my neighborhood I generally dread people talking to me because 90% of the time its a man harassing me. But again this could be a result of the impersonal nature of living in NYC- people dont interact with those who live on the same street as them. These men dont see me as a neighbor they live with- someone who goes to the shops they go to buys the same food goes to the same street fairs etc. anyway thanks for sharing! 11th December 2008 laura non-member comment communities natham this is great. so interesting and as catie said brings up so many issues. this was exactly what i struggled with after coming back from india...suddenly surrounded by people in their cars with the windows rolled up who wont make eye contact with you in the street automated check-machines even just having so much space in our houses here. i read a study that said the reason that so many people remember college as the best years of their life is because those were the 4 years they lived the way deep down we want to live - in a close community surrounded by each other all the time. an awesome book that looks at this issue in the context of environmental sustainability is Bill McKibbens Deep Economy The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future keep up the good work. see you soon!

At the moment Im writing this theres around 5 to 7 days left for most of the people in I-House. For my part I know Im leaving here on Sunday and then go to Tokyo for a week but leaving here feels like Im leaving Japan like all the other ones. Like if a kind of bound was linking us all... I know Ill have a great time in Tokyo but still I spent all the summer here with the same persons everyday shared everything with them washed my clothes with them this last one is a joke eh. Last week I sent my box! Yeah feels like everybody is moving sending boxes of what they got sonce they arrive here and doesnt fit in their bag. Its so expensive!!! For example mine was not too expensive 80$! wouhou! I guess this is a expense you have to expect when you spend six months in a country and buy lots of clothes and gifts. One girl here spent nearly 1000$ to send the mangas she bought here for 1$ each... I think its a bit extreme but oh well theyre lot more expensive where she from. My Watermelon party! play is going along pretty well its gonna be on the 13th of July in two days! We were supposed to do it last week on Friday but two days before two of the group came to me and asked if it was possible to change the day... it was pretty impossible for everybody to do it on the due date! Its crazy how the cultural programm student are busy right now all the papers are due the same week... and plus everybody was kind of sick... so finally the whole group was really happy to do it this week! Now we now our text last week we didnt... aye aye aye it could have been bad! and were more relaxed about it even if we still have 10000 things to do! Its great fun and I love it. It would have been the most interesting I did here appart from learning Japanese obviously! The 4th of July was the Independance day. Americans decided it was a good reason to light fireworks at 10h30 what was really fun until all the residents in the neighboring called the police its allright they came often in the past and the school Clifton the melon demon the day after thats less good now we have interdiction to light fireworks forever  I didnt do it for America having no nationalist feelings for it but I can say Im a little bit jealous of them they were able to do something by themselves and now looks like it works pretty well! I did it because fireworks are prrrrrretty. 😉 Last Friday was the I-House farewell party. Were gonna have one for the whole programm including Proxy and school staff next Friday. It was a pretty nice party free food a big fest of watermelon. It was really cool to see everybody around the three eating their big watermelons while spitting the seeds in the weeds. There were lots of ice cream too cookies and cream flavor included. mioum mioum. Then some of us went to karaoke it was pretty fun we sang for 4 hours some even stayed longer. Ill miss karaoke. But you know what? I was looking on the web and I found one in Montreal thats not a bar where there are 40 people you dont that look at you singing like a wanabee popstar. Ill have to bring you there. Sunday Yeong Kyoung Hung me and Aya I went to Italian Mura with Hung and his two sempai. It was pretty nice. Its a relatively small place but theres a lot of smelling sooooo good pizza restaurants pastas et tout le tralala. Between other things we went on a little ferry tour and a horse car tour... the driver was the first gaijin I could talk during the day I was happy to have the possibility to talk with someone because Hung and his sempai are not English speakers... but that guy was soooo not nice. I asked him a regular question about his horses... and he just nod his head with a look saying listen I dont fucking care about what you could tell me... anyway theres people like that I guess... but most of the time the horse riders have to be talkative and entertaining... not in Japan I guess! Well write to you later dont know when... I leave on Sunday for Tokyo going to take a break in the mountains and come back to Tokyo after. ciao! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 12 Displayed 12 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Melanie J.G.

We are staying at the Hotel Kurrajong which is very well-located in Barton for most of the things we have planned to visit/re-visit while we are in Canberra. After a self-catered breakfast in our room we set out on foot for Old Parliament House which houses the Museum of Australian Democracy. We approached from the side and walked through the Parliamentary Rose Gardens and then beside the Centenary of Women’s Suffrage Commemorative Fountain. Once inside we participated in a brief orientation tour and then continued exploring on our own. Although we have visited before and done the guided tour previously on our own we managed to explore parts of Old Parliament House that we have not seen before. Next on our itinerary was the National Library of Australia where we arrived just in time for the guided tour of the Treasures Gallery. Although I visited in January when I travelled to Canberra to see the ‘Cook and the Pacific’ exhibition the Treasures Gallery has been refreshed since then and some of the treasures on display have changed. Old Parliament House The guide told us that the gallery is refreshed twice each year so that more of the items that are held by the library can be brought out for display. We decided to eat lunch at the library’s Bookplate Cafe before moving on. There was a wait for inside tables which was bizarre on such a beautiful day so we took the opportunity to sit at an outside table straight away. We have to record that the food at the library was delicious for the benefit of anyone reading our blog who might be planning a trip to Canberra. On the move again we started heading towards the Australian National Gallery. Rather than walk directly to the gallery we took a detour down to the shore of Lake Burley Griffin where we photographed the Captain Cook Memorial Fountain and the National Carillon. At the gallery we concentrated on the permanent collections rather than paying for the Monet exhibition that is currently in residence. We have all seen Monet’s art in Paris and/or in Melbourne so felt that we didn’t need to see pieces by Monet that we may have seen before. We walked back to the hotel I can still remember when I had hair for a quick cuppa and to pick up the Golf to drive to the Australian War Memorial. We have not visited the war memorial in Canberra for at least 25 maybe even 30 years so it has been redeveloped and improved significantly since then. The audio visual displays were very good. We had thought that we would visit the war memorial quickly and then swing by the National Arboretum. In the end there was so much material at the war memorial that we were being herded out of the galleries at closing time. Being rounded up at closing time meant that we were still at the war memorial at 4.55 pm when the Last Post Ceremony is held. The memorial farewells visitors each night with the Last Post Ceremony in the Commemorative Courtyard. Each night the ceremony shares the story behind one of the names on the Roll of Honour. The ceremony began with the Australian national anthem followed by the pipers lament during which visitors laid wreaths and floral tributes beside the Pool of Reflection. After this the story of Lance Corporal Joseph Henry Littlefair was told and the Ode was recited by a member of the Senate Chamber Australian Defence Force. The ceremony ended with the sounding of the Last Post. It is impossible not to be moved by the solemnity of the ceremony especially the haunting notes of the Last Post. With the weather a bit threatening we decided to eat in at the Bar & Grill downstairs. It wasn’t as budget conscious as the Canberra Club but it was much tastier! The final card game of the holidays was another win to the girls. The luck has certainly been going our way during this fortnight with the girls tally at 13 wins to the boys only six.

We were woken by Kaylan at 6.00am although she tricked us by saying it was 4.45am!! It wasn’t! After breakfast we were told that loading would start at 9.00am which was when our luggage would be loaded on large nets and craned over the side into zodiacs and taken to the beach on King Edward Island. Several of the zodiacs were off loaded and luggage in place. Then all of a sudden the seas changed. Waves started to come over he zodiacs … with our suitcases in it. There were several zodiacs that made it to the beach but due to the now unsafe nature of the seas the zodiacs returned re-craned back on the ship and operations were stopped. Kaylan the Captain and King George authorities and the airlines all made the decision jointly for the plane from Punta Arenas to not fly to King George Island and that our ship was to go out King George Runway and surrounds 14 of the harbour as the ship traffic in the harbour was too great and finally One Ocean staff dealt with the onboard issues. We were all ready in our wet weather gear and rubber boots but the announcement came that the plane hadn’t left Punta Arenas and all zodiacs were back on the ship. For the next 5 hours the staff made us feel very comfortable ensuring all the bar reception area and dining rooms were made available to us as the ship’s hotel staff were busily getting the cabins ready for the next passengers. We were supplied with endless tea and coffee snacks and eventually a light lunch. The whole operation was impressive but I guess they were used to this sort of thing happening. We found out that one of the trips passengers were stuck on the ship for 5 days. This meant that the new passengers tour was cancelled. Wouldn’t you be devastated? Wow I wouldn’t like either of those scenarios. However a 2.00pm we received the call that the seas had calmed down the plane from Punta Arenas had departed on its 2 hour flight so all Captains Dinner on our last night 1 operations were a go! The last 2 zodiac loads of baggage was dealt with first and then passenger was loaded up and transported onto the beach. The sea had really calmed down drastically and the sun was peeping through the clouds. It was still extremely cold. We walk about a kilometre from the shore landing site past the Chilean research station and up towards the airstrip where we boarded our special charter flight. Our bags were transported in the back of the truck safely to the plane. We later heard that one of the passenger’s bag was soaked right through during the attempts to take the bags from the ship when the weather suddenly changed. One Ocean completely paid for the laundering of the total bag and clothes. We left our wet bags green boots red jackets and black over-pants on the shore for the next group of passengers. This flight with DAP took a little over two hours. We were served a meal and wine on the flight which was our dinner as it was 8.00pm by the time we had reached the Dream Hotel. Upon arrival into Punta Arenas Captains Dinner on our last night 2 we transferred from the airport into town by 2 busses. All but 6 of us were staying at the same hotel so it was so good to be able to see our new friends again at breakfast. We woke at 9.00am an indicator for the need to have a catchup sleep. We woke in Punta Arena to rain but as we had learned during the 5 nights 4 days previous to the cruise the rain doesn’t last long and the day ended up beautifully sunny ….. still with a slight nip in the air …. but not the Antarctic nip. We had a little supermarket shopping to do and then it was back to our favourite Chocolatier for wonderful Chilean coffee. We kept running into familiar faces which was wonderful. It was then time to prepare for our next 7-day adventure the Ros Roy Expedition with Patagonia Photo Expedition company. While waiting 2 days for this tour we visited the Nao Victorian Ship Museum opened in 2016. Ship-lovers have come together and built replica ships of the HMS Beagle Ancud and Ferdinand Magellan Ship. It was really interesting to see these King George Island 16 old sailing ships and wander into their lower decks to see how the sailors lived. The ship builders had done a fantastic joy at building the replicas. The first day we were back in Punta Arenas it was really sunny but the second day was really windy and very cold so we had to rug up. We learned that the previous weekend experienced 100mph winds. We were glad we weren’t there then. After we finished looking through all the ships we went into the coffee and sat next to their fire and waited for our taxi driver to arrive. We had organised him to wait as the Museum was several kilometres from the CBD and past the airport. That evening we officially started our next cruise.

No replacement available and could we wait whilst it was sent to the US to get a paint job. We ended up with two separate touring bikes and headed off on the train to start our trip outside of Sydney in a place called Emu Plains. We arrived fine and started to put up the tent just before the rain set in. John then turned to me with the brand new tent pole in two pieces. I went back to the bike to get some tape to tie it together on returning it was now in four separate pieces. OK off to get it fixed. No such luck. Our super duper tent was not the sort of thing they stock in Emu Plains and so we came back with a new tent and donated our other one to a nice man who thought his son might make use of it. Huddled inside the tent sheltering from the downpour we contemplated our first night on the road what else could go wrong? We awoke in a sodden field still raining and so we caught Another bustling town the train to our next destination of Katoomba this cycling malarky is darn easy where we had a nice tea. We set off on the bikes to try to reach our goal of Lithgow. In between us and Lithgow was the Blue Mountains so called because they are MOUNTAINS. We climbed at a rate of 4 kph and John fell off. The last 50k he struggled along in the only two gears that now worked. Good luck though as Lithgow had a bike shop and we were all mended and gorged ourselves on Pizza they got the order wrong so we ended up with 3 in stead of 2. That night we snuggled into our sleeping bags to awake only to find the temperature had dropped to a rather chilly 4 degrees. Our tropic weather sleeping bags were not going to cope. More mountains and we hit Bathurst where we borrowed a blanket and went shopping for winter gear. That night the heavens opened and we watched a tropical storm pour down on us. The train station looked nice and inviting. Have you booked the bikes?” said the friendly guard. Youll need to pack them and I dont think therell Roo watching be room. So we cycled out and on to Orange. The rain held off but not the mountains. Orange was lovely with beautiful autumn colours and the promise of local wines at the town festival. At last our luck was improving. In the morning we sped down a side road via a little place called Stuart Town. We stopped here for a burger from the cafe come grocer come petrol station come well you get the picture. It was the only place in town. The woman made us 2 steak sandwiches with the works steak bacon cheese egg beetroot lettuce tomato onions and pineapple!. Our attempts to be friendly with the locals fell on deaf ears as this was surely the most miserable place in Oz not so as we found out later. We were headed to camp by the nearby Buradong Dam but decided to keep going the extra 21 k to Wellington. A hard choice as the last 21 k after having done 70 k was mostly up hill. A quick overnight camp and a beer in the local RSL club like our British legion clubs brought our spirits up. On to Dubbo the big town in the Our luxury accomodation area they call it a city here but frankly a population of fifty isnt my idea of a city. The RSL club here however was absolutely huge and we proceeded to have a game of snooker on the full sized tables. It didnt take long before we were challenged to a match with the self proclaimed club champion Dianne. John proceeded to put every ball down in sight as she could only watch but graciously gave the game away by potting the white on the last shot a true gentleman. Our next stop - Trangie pronounced trannie whilst holding your nose. A real friendly place. By the campfire we were assured to see roos. John was led to the fence to gaze out as dusk fell and they would come to the water hole to drink. Nothing in fact we had only seen dead ones by the road. Oh well more beer at the RSL club where we were befriended by Digger and his mates. By now our cycling was being done in a drunken haze probably the only way to take my mind off the specially imported leather seats we had bought which would according to the advertising mould Canarvon Gorge Amphitheatre to your body”. Mine was moulding quite nicely but unfortunately to somebody elses body. At Coolibah we set up tent on the roadside next to the pub. All well and good but in the morning Johns bike had a puncture. No problem - two spare inner tubes and a whole puncture repair kit later we set off and arrived in Byrock. A town which declared itself the start of the real outback. Well town is a bit of an exageration as there was a pub and that was about it. We made camp. Johns bike now had a slow puncture. No means to repair and much jolity amongst the locals about fancy foreign bikes and a lot of what you really need advice. Fortunately a couple Hilary and Bill took pity and put our bikes and us onto their trailer and we headed off to the next town of Bourke pronounced burk. At the paper shop come grocer come bike shop we were unable to find tubes or tyres to fit. The owner helped us order from Dubbo new extra thick tubes. We were then thrown into the back of a Ute and taken to the campsite. A couple took us back into town so that we could go to the library to look up our e-mails. How nice we should get a bottle of wine to take to the BBQ tonight. The Liquer store looked more like a prison camp as everything was behind bars but we negotiated a nice little red to take with us. Have you got a car? Asked the storekeeper. What a place ............... you can only buy alcohol if you are going to drive directly afterwards. We went away empty handed but were gifted a bottle by our taxi drivers. The BBQ went ahead and we were treated to Bush Poetry which is mostly Ozzies whingeing on about whingeing Poms and steak and Pikelets whilst we waited for our billy to boil. Yes they really do try to boil their Billys here. By now we had reached the Great Artesian Basin where all water comes out of the ground hot and smelling of rotten eggs but we were assured perfectly drinkable. Nardoo promised bathing in these waters. We arrived and spent time between the campfire and two tin tubs of the stuff. Just what our aching muscles needed. The town of Charleville gave us the opportunity to gaze at the stars at the Cosmos Centre accompanied by 4 young girls well one was 80. By now we were becoming famous amongst the grey nomads of Oz. Many people had seen us as they drove past and were keen to find out if we had escaped from an asylum. Special mention goes to the breakfast club who were travelling in their caravans and arriving at the same destination several hours before us and provided us with vegemite toast and coffee for breakfast. One of the reason s for travelling this route was to visit the Carnavon Gorge but we soon found out that our bikes would not make it across the 26 or 15 or 44 km of dirt road it all depends who you talk to. Our saviours arrived in the form of Robyn Hood and little John who arranged with their friends to get us and our bikes into the gorge. One thing we didnt realise was that 3 days in the gorge there was no food and so we spent the time scavenging what we could. The real lesson learned was that it is possible to make a gourmet meal on a camp fire and inspired our later attempts at campfire spaghetti carbonara. Our final outback destination was Emerald where we boarded a train and side stepped onto the coast as Rays birthday approached. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Ed Woolfe CastOffs Joined January 13th 2009 Trips 0 Last Login May 2nd 2011 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 9 Guestbook 21 Photos 42 Forum Posts 0 blog=414423 blogger=106526 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=414423 blogger=106526 Advertisement Brief history of Australia Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century.

Day 9 - A train ride to an Ancient City!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Lawrence/Gotzen Thailand Adventure Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Ayutthaya December 14th 2017 Published December 17th 2017Edit Blog Post KristalLawrence 0295F100-3718-46B6-ACC5-67B5DE1A6555. So this morning was a bit hectic running around packing up last minute items and checking under beds in cupboards and behind doors for any lost items......I dont think we managed to leave too much behind! Whilst I was showering I could hear the phone ringing and when I got out Todd mentioned that Anand had called and that he was calling back. So he calls back and says - Hey what happened to you? I am here at your hotel in Ayutthaya and you are not here!! Holy fuckballs I booked the tour for the wrong freaking date. OMG. I apologised profusely to Anand for wasting his time and the drivers time and we tried to work out what best to do. He suggested that they just come and get us now but we had already booked train tickets. Anyway in the end and for some extra baht to compensate for lost time we rescheduled for the next day. Now by this time I am freaking out because we are way late to check out and get into some taxis to the train station. So we raced downstairs to check out and to ask to use the computer at reception 25D59D25-3B4A-4ED6-9BBB-485D84CC5775. again to print our train tickets. This all took more time and I am now certain we are going to miss our train if there is even a skerrick of traffic......and this is Bangkok! So we check out print the tickets and ask the receptionist to call 2 taxis to fit all our crap in! We have seriously overpacked what a damn shock lol. So we jump in the 2 taxis and we thought they knew where we were going but Todd texts me 5 minutes in saying his driver speaks zero English and doesnt know where he is going. I tell him the name of the station and send him a google map location pin to show the driver. No luck he had no idea what Todd was talking about. Randomly and I have NO idea how this happened after 15 minutes of driving through hectic Bangkok traffic but all of a sudden there was a guy knocking on the window of the taxi Kalyb and I were in......it was Todds taxi driver asking our driver where the hell we were going. Their car was somehow directly in front of us? Still confused as to how this happened 0128DE8C-A7EB-4A58-83EA-28CB452AD3B3. but hey it was lucky! So we get to the train station with about 6 minutes to spare to find our train. We clearly looked lost and were approached by an attendant at the station who pointed vaguely in the direction of the platforms. We raced off in that direction and looked for some kind of indication as to what train was going where. We found another staff member who pointed out our platform and we dragged our bags up the crazy stairs and into the train........only to be told by the conductor on board that the bags had to go back out and to the back of the train in a different car. I was a little nervous about this but we did as we were told and then took our seat. Woohoo! We are still winning at public transport 😊 So after we set off there were train waitresses came down the aisle with some water and a little meal. We got steamed rice chicken mince with chilli and basil and curried mackerels. Weird little meal and none of us were real keen to try the mackerel but the chicken was good. At one point the CC9CA0F2-4657-4DEC-868C-70762190868A. scary conductor who had told us off for bringing our bags on board travelled down the train checking tickets. He got to the American guy across the aisle from us and got very agitated all of a sudden Wrong train wrong train! He insisted. The guy was like really? Do I need to get off? At this point we are travelling along at speed so it isnt like he can get off. The conductor walked away then came back and again pointed to the guys ticket and said Wrong train!. The dude again asked if he should get off the conductor had very little English and there was some serious communication problems when the Thai man seated in front of him intervened and spoke at length to the cranky conductor. He translated for the American guy he was definitely on the wrong train and he should get off at the next stop and wait for the next train to come along. I felt so sorry for the guy he was crazy confused and the conductor was way scary lol. Glad we got our tickets checked before we got on the train! We did however end up getting a weird guy 31D2C39F-A91A-4FC1-B7EE-8341259D84D0. who insisted we were in his seat even though the train had heaps of bloody empty seats and he got the waitress lady to move us. So Kalyb and I ended up being moved a row forward and this weird guy sat in between us and Corey and Todd. No idea what that was about but whatever! The train ride was quicker than I expected it was 90 minutes but it went really fast with quite a bit of travel through some of the poorer parts of Bangkok. Kinda reminiscent of Slumdog Millionaire all the tin shed houses built right alongside each other along the canals. After passing through this area we chugged along into the countryside through rice paddies and farm lands until before we knew it we were pulling in to Ayutthaya Station and the scary conductor came to kick us off his train! We got off collected our bags and set off to find some transportation to our hotel. We were an easy mark for the tuk-tuk mafia out front and the organiser of the chaos descended upon us and our ten tonnes of luggage and asked where we were going. I tried to pronounce our 0D4AC4AA-3754-40E5-A650-1CE244034BF7. hotel name and clearly got it woef ully wrong because he looked blankly at me. So I showed him the hotel on the map and he said the name in a way that didnt even resemble what I was saying said 180 baht and I was not in the mood to argue. We squeezed all 4 suitcases 4 people and all our backpacks into the tuk tuk which was a larger variety than the one we rode in Bangkok but just as mad! It was like a little ute with railings and a roof over the tray. It was full madness coming through the traffic again and I held on for dear life. Really wish we could have gotten a good pic of us all squished in there. Anyway it was only a short ride to our hotel thank god and we made it in one piece. We managed to check in and headed up the stairs to our rooms. The Silp-Pa Phra Nakhon hotel is really funky its small and full of stuff and artifacts kind of like a museum! We did however have to drag our cases up the steep flight of stairs which was a mission. Once 98060AFF-0B80-4B1F-9994-694C66FB12FA. we dropped our bags in we decided to go to the little onsite cafe for a beer. This was weird it was like going into the owners kitchen! The kitchen didnt really look open for business so we decided to go exploring to find something to eat. It is hot as balls in Ayutthaya felt way hotter than Bangkok humid and still with no breeze. It was also clear that we are not in Kansas any more Toto. In Bangkok most signs were in both Thai and English.....not here! No English words to be seen and no dummy proof pictures of the food in the menus either. We walked past heaps of street food stalls and a gorgeous little fruit market selling all kinds of things I had never seen before but it was so freaking hot we really wanted to find someplace inside with air-conditioning. This turned out to be a bit of a mission to find! When we finally did find a place it was an ice-cream parlour! Oh well fuck it were on holidays and its a million degrees who says we cant have ice-cream for lunch! It was actually the weirdest ice-cream Ive ever had. I F13B4AE0-BFC5-446A-9F36-1DD7974E64B1. had a brownie sundae Todd had a strawberry cheesecake sundae and Corey had waffles and ice-cream with strawberries. The ice-cream was more like shaved ice it was dry for lack of a better description almost powdery so hard to explain and it didnt have a lot of flavour to it but it came topped with brownies and goodness and a funky sauce to drizzle over yourself. Kinda caramely without being caramel lol. It was tasty as anyway. We scarfed it down and felt much refreshed and cooled down ready for the trek back to the hotel. The walk itself was really interesting all the little food stalls and open air shops. The light posts are ornately decorated with gold elephants or fish or other animals and there are frequent elaborate pictures in golden frames of the King and offerings to the gods in little shrine things that are on practically every property. So the walk around this place was really cool. We got back to the hotel and were hot as balls again and pretty tired from travelling so we had some quiet time in the afternoon. Todd had a nap and I just chilled and watched some tv 1F14EEC1-B830-41B4-A35D-D6E1EF51CF94. from our harddrive on the laptop. No English TV channels at this place! Corey tried to watch Cartoon Network in Thai but it did his head in after a while! When evening arrived we decided to venture out for dinner. We asked reception to call us a tuk-tuk said a quick prayer and knocked on the lucky wood then jumped in! Again the restaurant we went to wasnt too far away thank goodness so we didnt spend long in the crazy vehicle. We went to the Seven Seas restaurant which is right on the river and were welcomed by yet more friendly Thai people. Our Thai greetings are getting better and we always get a great big smile when we use the few words we know. The food was fabulous Corey is continuing to sample every spaghetti bolognese that he can find which is ok but is driving Kalyb crazy because he wont try the Thai food. I am just glad we have been able to find food he will eat! There has been spaghetti almost everywhere haha. We also had some really yummy cocktails had myself a couple of Mai Thais and Todd had a flaming something 2166D312-F3E9-4BE0-AE46-01347DFC1BA0. or other. I had been feeling a bit fluey all day with a sore throat and headache so we headed back to the room early and I went to bed for a good sleep! We had our tour of the ruins the next day and were being picked up at 8am! No way was a flu keeping me from this one 😊 « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 22 Displayed 22 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Kristal Lawrence KristalLawrence Joined April 18th 2017 Trips 1 Last Login December 16th 2018 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 17 Guestbook 5 Photos 519 Forum Posts 0 blog=1006755 blogger=369091 Blog Options Blog Map Print Version blog=1006755 blogger=369091 Advertisement Brief history of Thailand A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century.

We found it to be an interesting city that deserved a post. Overall Strasbourg is a modern easy city with an excellent bike-way system and a tram system that seems highly efficient. We found it pleasant and safe to walk around although you should try to avoid walking on the bike paths. The first thing we did in Strasbourg was find a walking tour. There are a number in the usual places on the internet. Happy Tours seemed to receive good reviews and had a few different tours in English so we decided to give them a try. Unfortunatey it was a damp day and turned into a full blown rainy day as the tour progressed. This possibly reduced the numbers but there were still more than 20 people on the tour. Gabriel was our guide and this was the original tour we also took a Petite France tour with Leo mentioned in an ealier post. The tour took us through the changes in Strasbourg since the original Celtic village was taken over by the Romans Street art Strasbourg who established an army camp called Argentoratum. Since then it has been taken over by the Allemagnes the Franks the French and the Germans the latter two on numerous occasions. For a considerable period it was a free city of the Holy Roman Empireowing allegiance to no other power and was governed during that period by its own elected council. Perhaps not quite as democratically elected as may happen in some countries today but a definite step up from being run by a noble. To become free the people of Strasbourg had to remove the corrupt bishop who was in charge at that time. Every change of control brought changes in architecture. There is a mix of French German and home grown Alsacienne. Many streets include houses from a number of different periods and at first it seemed a little chaotic. Each change of controlling country brought with it a new building style along with the requirement to speak the language of the conqueror - on some occasions the following day. In the lifetime of most people in the city except for the current generation there have been changes. There appears to be a very strong feeling that In a bookshop window with the European Union France and Germany are now close friends and allies and that this is a very good thing. Like every town city or country Strasbourg claims whatever it can. For instance the bloke who wrote the Marseilles - the French National Anthem - did it overnight in a barracks in the main square - the Kleber Square - of Strasbourg. He worked in a barracks that took up most of one side of the square now an up-market shopping arcade/mall where you cant take photos. Gutenberg has a statue in a square near the Cathedral because he possibly developed the printing press here rather than his home town over in Germany. Museums are often a great way to find some good background on a city or a place and we tend to visit them when we can. We selected 4 from the long-ish list. The Museum of Contemporary and Modern Art MACMA was just up the way from our accommodation and given that we walked past it normally a couple of times a day we figured it had to be top of the list. It was a nice surprise when we walked in. We Gutenberg Square knew that one Sunday every month admission to museums is free and it turned out that it was the first Sunday so our museum day was free. The MACMA is having its 20th Anniversary so there is some remodelling underway but it is still an interesting place to visit. Not the best exhibition we have ever seen but not the worst. It took 3 or 4 hours to see the exhibits. We went for a cup of coffee at the MACMA cafe and stumbled on what appears to be a thing - perhaps only on free days but maybe more often. The cafe was offering a buffet breakfast for 24 Euros a head. It looked like it was all you can eat judging by the amounts some had loaded on to their plates. We made do with cup of coffee each and a piece of cake. MACMAs building itself is worth a look. The Museum of Alsace or the Alsace Museum is a good walk along the canal or river on the border of Petite France. The museum was first established in 1906. It now operates through 3 adjoining houses with 30 rooms of exhibitions of Marsellaise was written in this building life in Alsace during the last couple of centuries. It provides an excellent view of the cultural and historical life and is very well worth a visit. The Museum of Strasbourg is across the water from the Museum of Alsace. It traces the history of the city from its beginnings through its key events normally relating to one of the many changes of country governance and ownership of the city over the last 1000-odd years. It is a good exhibition. Unfortunately the combined effect of dark red walls a lack of light and small print on some of the explanatory material made it a little tiresome at times. There was however a lot of information and there was no flinching in its description of some of the recent issues in the development of Strasbourg. The Cave Historique Hospices Strasbourg has been operating since 1395. It was established as a place to hold the payments made by people for their health care. Then as is much the case now only about 10% of people had the wherewithal to pay for the care they needed from hospitals. Those that couldnt pay money traded with goods and in the Alsace Decisions decisions! And no we didnt choose the yoghurt on the left even though we were supposed to be buying something for breakfast! region wine was produced and therefore traded for health care. Many other hospitals operated the same system. Strasbourg is the only one left operating. Some of the others send their wine to Strasbourg where it is cellared and bottled. If you are even a little interested in wine and history perhaps even in health economics you will enjoy this museum. It holds a barrel with the oldest wine in a barrel in the world. The wine was put down in 1472. There is a bottle that can be viewed of this wine. It is reputed to still be wine and still drinkable. It has been tasted 3 times. Once 100 years after it was put down once at the end of WW2 and I cant remember the other. Wine traded for health care was originally used in the hospital and for mass. Water back in the day wasnt always fit for human consumption whereas wine had more of a chance of being so. We were told that a more wealthy person could be provided with 2 litres of wine per day as part of their treatment. In those days wine did not always have the same concentration of Local specialty at the markets. The ginger nougat was particularly tasty. alcohol as today. As the practice of paying by trading wine gradually dropped away the cellar revived the tradition by asking wine growers to place some of their vintages with the cellar. The Cave Historique Hospices then cellars it cares for it and bottles it. A proportion of the wine is given over to be sold with the Hospitals label the remainder with the owners label. The cellar is an 80m long cave under the original hospital. An area is sealed off at the end where some special wines are being cellared. This used to be the area where the cadavers were stored and was utilised for teaching and research purposes. A semi-circular trap door which provided access for the corpses to the cellar area is still in existence at the front door of the old hospital. This was all highly secretive because the dismembering of bodies was illegal and very much frowned upon by the church. Signage to the cellar isnt great. You go into the hospital grounds and find your way to the area. There are some signs. The cellar is down a flight of stairs and once there you can hire an audio guide Complicated door bell - in the Museum of Alsace for 3 Euros. The guide is informative and useful. Prices for wine at the Cellar are a little less than you pay retail. Much activity and a little excitement at the end of the day. We stopped at a little bar outside the main tourist area for a drink on our way home. Just as we were sitting down a man sprinted down the road next to the bar. We noticed. You dont see that many people moving that quickly on foot. This man was pursued by 2 police officers also on foot. In an impressive exhibition of reaction time less than 30 seconds later 2 police on motor bikes roared down the same road followed a little later by a van. We had noticed these vans earlier in the day. They carried 6-8 officers and were quietly parked around the centre. We had no idea what was going on and still dont but to add interest there were a number of sirens during the night. Sirens arent uncommon but there seemed to be more than normal. People at the bar paid attention that is they looked up and over but no-one moved as far as we could tell. Imagine these spouts spewing out milled grain! But then it was 5.00 oclock and most tables were taken. If you jumped up to look around you might have lost your spot. Music shops Shopping Malls Flash Buildings It is not all old city and old buildings. Cities have a lot of functions other than looking after tourists. We were keen to find some music shops those that sold musical instruments in particular. Even more precisely those that sold mandolins. There are cave paintings in France dating back thousands of years depicting an instrument that might have been a lute which is the first cousin of the mandola which in turn was shortened up a bit and became the mandolin. How quickly they forget. Just a few thousand years and it is very hard to find a decent mandolin here for love nor money. Mandolins these days are most popular in the USA Ireland and Australia - where some very good ones are made. Our search may have to continue in other places. We were also on the lookout for clothing. Not Decathlon this time. A bit more flash and suitable for attendance at an important wedding to occur shortly after - the next Meeting one of the criteria! We were told that Strasbourg Councillors were measure here each year after their election. If their stomachs were too big for the gap off the Council they went. day - we make it back to Australia. In the city centre there are a couple of shopping malls and streets with womens clothing some of it very nice but nothing so far that has made the cut. Getting away from the centre and the old city has its advantages. You get to see a modern progressive city that is the official seat of the European Parliament and has the HQ of the European Court of Human Rights. The city seems to provide a good quality of life for its citizens. It is hard to tell for sure but you get the impression of a place that would be easy to live in and that would provide for many of the needs that people might have. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 35 Displayed 29 « Back 1 2 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 19 Message Slowfeet Slowfeet Our travels over the years have often sought out those places that we havent yet experienced.

I’ve been in Oz for twelve days now and I’ve got another four weeks to do. Still the convicts had to stay for a lot longer so it’s not so bad. Up to now I’ve just been doing the tourist thing with Anna which has been a wonderful time. Where to start on my first Aussie blog? I know South Africa. There were a few interesting things that happened after my last blog well they were interesting to me anyway so behave and listen up while I tell you about them. On the Saturday night before I left had a very disturbed night as something was digging around m caravan. After twenty minutes the dogs started barking just outside my door so I decided to let them tackle the intruder and I would get the edited highlights in the morning. However the dogs decided that maybe they would leave it alone after all and all went quiet except for the persistent loud scratching that appeared to be coming from my caravan. Eventually I remembered I was British and summoned up the blood The invisible man check out the hat appearing over the top of the log. How was I ever spotted? and stiffened up the sinews Shakespeare and went outside with a torch ready to do battle with whatever was stopping me from sleeping. I shone the torch in every nook and cranny under my caravan without success and went back to bed. Hooray all was quiet at last. It wasn’t scared of the dogs but big tough brave me scared it away. In the morning I saw that the roots of a small tree about five yards away from my door were dug up and chewed through by a porcupine. All the time I had been searching under my caravan it had been behind me in the dark laughing its head off. After breakfast and a good old whinge about how tired I was due to the inconsiderate behaviour of my spiky opponent we all camouflaged ourselves for a bit of a game in the bush to see who could get closest to Adele a fearsome bush women able to see a snake from two hundred yards. I would have won except for being so tired from lack of sleep. Honest please believe me. Anyway it was a very enjoyable way to spend my last day in the South African Keith and meerkat This little fellow was kept as a pet by the owners of the cafe we called at. The other one is a meerkat. bush. I arrived at Sydney airport to find that all my money and travelers cheques had been taken from the money belt which I had foolishly kept in an outside pocket of my carry on luggage. The thief had kindly returned the money belt to the correct pocket so as not to alert me until they were out of range of my retribution. After an overnight stay in Sydney during which I got two hours sleep due to jet lag I met up with Anna in Cairns. She immediately took charge of me and got us a taxi to the caravan park we were staying at. The Thursday was spent exploring Cairns sunbathing and swimming in the lagoon which is a big outdoor artificial pool and beach at one end of the esplanade. The beach at Cairns is a bit of a let down as it is basically a mangrove swamp with the mangrove trees all pulled up. It’s very good for shore birds though and I got some good snaps. The next day more of the same and we booked our tickets for a couple of trips out. On Saturday we caught the coach to Kuranda and the Rainforeststation The gang on the baobab tree The Hoedspruit giant. An enormous baobab tree the second biggest in South Africa. The cafe nearby make wonderful pancakes. Nature Park. First stop was the Rainforeststation which is really a small zoo where you can feed the kangaroos and wallabies and see some of the local animals plus some aboriginal blokes give demonstrations of spear and boomerang throwing plus a bit of a show with dancing and didgeridooing. We then went on what was billed as a rainforest tour in an ex army DUKW an amphibious lorry. This was a bit of a disappointment because we just travelled through a bit of a pond. Anna’s fears about a crocodile jumping onboard were unfounded because apparently the only croc in fifty miles is in a pen back at the zoo. Back onto the bus and we headed for Kuranda village which is an old outback town by the river. It was very touristified and although the buildings were genuine they had all been turned into souvenir shops and cafes. We had a nice walk by the river before taking our seats on the Kuranda Scenic Railway. This snakes its way down the Barron river gorge past some stunning waterfalls and scenery until it gets into Cairns 25 miles away and over a thousand feet lower down. The next day we Jackel at the waterhole The last mammal I snapped in South Africa. went on a coach trip with a difference as our driver and guide Kiwi Matty” not only drove and guided us but led the swimming in the icy pools and waterfalls of the various Tablelands rivers. He had a dry sense of humour which he demonstrated in his commentary which he kept up almost the whole way over the coach loudspeakers. All in all very good value for money as we were out for twelve and a half hours during which time Matty never shut up. On Tuesday a certain grumpy child would not get out of bed so I toddled off to Cairns with just my camera for company. The big white lens on my camera is certainly an ice breaker and I had chats with a few interesting people while I was out. A young woman from San Francisco then a girl from Canada both walked with me a while. I suppose it’s a bit depressing to think that they didn’t see me as someone who might start to pursue them with amorous intentions just an old guy doddering about. I then met a real old guy John who was a birdwatcher and had been until his retirement Cairns lagoon Its a wonderful swimming pool to make up for the rubbish beach one of the first wildlife guides in Cairns. He pointed out various crabs fish and birds as we walked along until we went our separate ways. After five minutes walking I heard a slurred greeting and turned around to see what could be described with a bit of generosity of spirit as a local character. I didn’t quite get his name but it didn’t matter as he went on to tell me about his days as a sheep shearer and gold prospector. He tried to use my zoom lens to pick out his little house buried in the forests at one end of the bay but gave up. He told me how isolated it was with no neighbours thank God.” A very interesting old bloke but I found that about ten minutes was more than enough as he punctuated his conversation with ribald comments to every woman that caught his eye before taking a swig from the coke bottle that obviously did not have coke in it. And so back to our digs as the light faded to find Anna getting ready to go out for our evening meal. I had told Anna that our boat for the barrier reef Me at the lagoon Swimming on our second day at the lagoon left at 8.00 the next day Wednesday and so we were able to get there at ten past eight on the dot. The real checking in time was 8.30 but I thought it was too risky to tell her that. What a marvelous experience we had as the big fast catamaran took ninety minutes to get us to a huge platform moored on the outer reef. As soon as we landed myself and the only other certified diver were hustled off the boat before everyone else to get kitted up for our first dive. It was good for the ego when the tannoy asked for the certified divers to go for our briefing and they were talking about little old me. I felt very posh. The dive itself was amazing only eight metres of water but so many things to observe. I saw fish of all colours and sizes including Wally who is a Maori Wrasse about five feet long and built like a prop forward. He is trained to come up to see you so that a handily placed photographer can snap you for a souvenir. I was too tight fisted to shell out the seventeen dollars for what Tour bus The bus took us up to Kuranda and the train took us down. was admittedley a nice snap. Before my next dive I snorkeled with Anna and we took snaps of each other with the underwater camera that she had bought for my birthday. She was having a wonderful time snorkeling in the calm shallow water and also in the submarine type thing that she went in to do some underwater viewing.On my second dive we went on a small boat to a reef a couple of hundred yards away. This was a bit deeper and I got down to sixteen and a half metres with the reef wall towering above us. The visibility was not as good as the shallower reef but the 45 minute dive was still amazing as we were at one point in a huge shoal of silver open water fish that turned and flashed in the sunlight just like you see on the telly. We got off the boat at five o’clock after a wonderful day in the clear blue waters of the Great Barrier Reef. On Thursday it was time for me to go back to Sydney and Anna decided she would fly back to Perth as jobs were a bit hard to come by. Cairns Anna and Skippy Anna hoping that someone would give her a handful of Kangaroo food is a magnet for backpackers and Anna’s CV was put on a large pile of others. Anyway I flew off at seven o’clock and got to my hostel at 11.30. The key was as promised in the mailbox and I walked in to see a Japanese guy walking about in just a bath towel. He had locked his room key in his room and didn’t know what to do. Luckily there were two beds in my room so I put him up for the night. The next day I was on my way to Bathurst for my project. It’s only this far on the map imagine me holding my finger and thumb two inches apart. The journey took four and a half hours by train and coach and then we were met by the local ACV rep who took us to our quarters. Here I am in chilly Bathurst ready for some hard work and hopefully some nice kangaroo snaps. See you soon. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 25 Displayed 25 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Ken Thomas KennyT Im just about to start a dream trip around the world lasting from March until December.

I am so happy to be here for a number of reasons. Firstly and mainly as I indeed made it safely here on Sunday evening following a night of Typhoon Jongdari passing directly overhead back in Kyoto. Secondly as after the tourist-hotspot of Kyoto it is a great relief to be off-the-beaten track here with the only other few tourists around being the polite gracious and wonderful Japanese people! And finally as it’s just a fantastic place and I have had a very enjoyable few days here indeed. I believe I last wrote after being a bit concerned about my travel plans on Sunday with Typhoon Jongdari fast approaching on Saturday evening. It is for times like these that I carry with me on my travels my travel bottle of brandy – after a short swig from this magical bottle my nerves for the approaching typhoon quickly subsided and I began to realise that experiencing a typhoon is actually surely part of the Japanese experience. All in all it really Dogo Onsen Matsuyama didn’t seem that bad. Although I woke probably around 2am or so to the roaring sound of the wind outside it really didn’t seem that bad when I looked out of the window – there was indeed a strong sustained wind but the rain seemed quite light. The next morning all seemed normal again in Kyoto and in actual fact the typhoon had brought about a great change in the funkiness of the humid atmosphere – it now felt fresh and clear and the distant mountains were very clearly visible now. It was almost like the typhoon had vacuumed away the humid stale and really hot air of Kyoto and brought freshness in its path – really quite welcome actually! And as I thought the shinkansen bullet trains were indeed not affected at all by the typhoon. After packing my bags and taking a bus to Kyoto Station I was able to take my first two trains with no problems at all – first from Kyoto to Shin-Osaka and then from Shin-Osaka to a small city called Okayama. Amazing that right after a typhoon the country seems to return back to normal again. This was quite a contrast to my Ishite-ji Buddhist Temple Matsuyama experiences of Hurricane Earl in Guatemala back in 2016 both Hurricane Earl and Typhoon Jongdari having been Category 1 on the hurricane scale when they both made landfall. Hurricane Earl brought trees roofs and bridges down and cut out the water electricity and internet connection all around me for about two days. This contrast was a great first-hand experience of what I again have taught in my years as a Geography teacher that natural disasters affect developing countries far worse than developed countries due to their lack of preparedness. Japan in all ways it seems appears very prepared for its disasters. Having said this the local express not shinkansen train line which was to take me from Okayama to Matsuyama was indeed cancelled for the whole day. I did anticipate this and I actually thought it would be very difficult to get a bus ticket given the number of passengers who must have been affected by this. This was not so and I managed to book myself on the next coach leaving for Matsuyama two hours after arriving in Okayama giving me some time to spend in Okayama during which I enjoyed a very relaxing noodle lunch in a Matsuyama-jo Me as a samurai! nearby air-conditioned fast-food joint. So finally just after 2pm I was making the last leg of my journey by bus from Honshu to Shikoku. And what a spectacular journey it was. We first began by crossing Japan’s Inland Sea the overall name given to the body of water between the islands of Honshu and Shikoku over the spectacular Great Seto Bridge. This was not just one bridge but a series of six bridges and five viaducts spanning 8.1 miles in total making it the world’s longest two-tiered bridge system. It was quite spectacular. And the island of Shikoku continued to impress with a very different feel to Honshu – far more rural less developed and actually even more beautiful with its rugged mountainous landscape and forested hills in all directions. For the whole journey to Matsuyama we went through tunnel followed by luscious forested mountain valley followed by tunnel and so on. It was a beautiful journey and maybe even better having taken it by bus. And by the evening I checked into a really quite swish hotel the APA Matsuyama-jo Nishi – similar in price to my two previous business hotels but a bit beyond a business hotel I The Great Seto Bridge Linking the Japanese main island of Honshu with the island of Shikoku. At 8.1 miles long it is the worlds longest two-tiered bridge system and is made up of six major bridges and five viaducts. think in terms of size and grandeur. Ah this is the life. I have had two full days here in Matsuyama and my travels continue to keep me really quite busy indeed but very enjoyable still. This has been quite different to many of my previous trips where each destination has only had one or two attractions giving me lots of time to just chill and relax in my hotel room – on my Japanese journey so far there are so many possible sights to see to choose from that each day I have been out from about 10am returning around 7pm. Still I don’t feel tired and travelling in Japan seems to actually be filling me with wonderful energy. Yesterday was a packed day in terms of sightseeing. I first started out by heading towards the amazing Matsuyama-jo the castle on top of the nearby hill Mt Katsuyama towards which my room has a stunning view and which is actually located right in the middle of the city of Matsuyama. Unfortunately the path up which is nearest to the hotel was closed seemingly due to fallen trees and mudslides brought upon by the recent torrential rains here The Inland Sea Honshu on the left Shikoku on the right in this part of Japan. Fortunately however this meant that I walked all the way to the other side and took the amazing chairlift up to the top – a little perturbing given there was no safety barrier or seatbelt or anything making it very easy if one wished to just slip out of the chair and fall to the ground below – not that I did this of course but it did make it a bit scary as well as enjoyable. And what a beautiful castle it was – I enjoyed a good hour or so looking around my first Japanese castle. Quite different to the European version of a castle the Japanese castle is built with a typical Japanese-tiered flooring system and a curved roof. They were still used as buildings of defence during the shogunate warlord era of Japan where clans and samurai would often fight with their neighbours during the feudal times before the Meiji restoration of 1868. Matsuyama castle was built in 1603 so it has lots of history. The tour also included being able to lift up a samurai katana” sword which actually seemed quite light and even put on some modern samurai armour. Shikoku Valley Shikoku I enjoyed both of these experiences very much. Following my visit I walked back down the hill through lush forest towards the city centre and ended up in the Takashimaya department store I wondered why the name was familiar along with the bookshop chain Kinokuniya until I remembered that both these large Japanese stores have branches in Singapore my stomping grounds for a year back in 2006-2007. I didn’t realise it but happily found out that the large ferris wheel that I can see from my hotel room is actually entered on the top floor of the Takashimaya store. To my even greater happiness I was told that a trip on the wheel is actually free for foreigners – interesting and I was definitely up for it! Although I actually found the experience to be quite nerve-racking – I don’t usually fear heights but this felt a bit different and I had to do some breathing techniques particularly towards the top as I felt some kind of panic attack was coming on… I shall remember this for next time I think. After this I took a tram to the east of the city to first visit the Ishite-ji Buddhist Temple Shikoku Valley Shikoku and then the Dogo Onsen more on this below. This temple is actually number 51 of a total of 88 temples and a pilgrimage to visit all of them is actually one of the things Shikoku is most famous for. Following in the footsteps of Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi 774-835 who apparently achieved enlightenment on Shikoku and founded one of Japan’s three main schools of Buddhism Shingon the other two being Zen and Pure Land pilgrims known as henro make the mammoth journey of 1400km visiting all 88 temples in around two months or so. I certainly was not up for such a pilgrimage but was happy to visit Temple No. 51 apparently one of the most impressive. I happied away a good hour or so in its grounds including quite a memorable experience of a tunnel. I saw an entrance into the large hill just behind the main temple area and stepped foot inside to see two long dimly-lit passageways – one straight ahead the other to my right. Immediately stepping foot inside however I felt a very bad feeling emanating from both tunnels I did not like it one bit. It was all I could do to stay Matsuyama City Street Matsuyama and take a couple of photos and when I had my back to the tunnels to take a final photo of the main entrance I had the worst sensation of bad feelings from behind me. It was a real relief to get out if I’m honest. A short while later a local friendly Japanese gentleman called Shinji struck up a conversation with me. He was a fascinating character and I very much enjoyed listening to him speak yes he spoke I listened…!. He started off in Japanese then moved on to very broken English and finished off with actually quite fluent English – he told me it had been a while since he had last spoken English the practice must have improved his fluency. He in fact had lived in many international places working as a celloist including New York Puerto Rico Colombia and Brazil. What struck me was what he told me about the tunnel when I asked him. He says it’s where old people go when they want to meet the spirits of their ancestors who dwell inside the tunnels. He said that only old people go there. When I told him of my fear in the tunnel Matsuyama Tram Matsuyama he told me that he had the same fear when he was young but now that he is older 72 years old he actually enjoys going inside the tunnel as there he can meet with his parents uncle and other passed-away ancestors. I found this very interesting and was glad to hear an explanation for my bad feelings inside the tunnel – I believe I am quite sensitive to these things. And finally from the temple it was a short walk to the nearby Dogo Onsen perhaps actually Japan’s most famous onsen and the main attraction in Matsuyama. Dogo Onsen was built in 1894 though its origins are legendary - apparently during the time of the gods a white heron was found healing itself in the spring which feeds the onsen waters today. The bath house was recently made famous by Japan’s apparently greatest modern literary figure Natsume Soseki when he wrote about it in his 1906 novel Botchan”  based on his life in Matsuyama and Dogo Onsen as a schoolteacher. It is also apparently the bath house which was the inspiration for the 2001 Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away” the production house’s most famous cartoon film I Matsuyama Tram Matsuyama believe in the west as it won an Oscar in 2003. I shall have to watch this again when I return although I could indeed see the similarity between the spirit bath house in the film and the Dogo Onsen. I very much enjoyed a soak in the steaming baths of the onsen and its atmospheric surrounds. This brought my sightseeing to a close yesterday as I took a tram back to my hotel in the blissful post-onsen state of feeling squeaky clean and dreamily tired once more! Today was a bit less packed in terms of sightseeing but still very enjoyable. It was actually quite nice to take it a bit more slowly. I started out by just missing a train to the nearby town of Uchiko famous for wax production and having undergone a recent mini-renaissance in domestic tourism due to its very atmospheric Yokaichi Historic District packed with old Japanese homes tea-houses and the like. It was two hours until the next train which was actually quite nice as it forced me to slow down a bit for the day. I chilled away a couple of hours around the station to include a good talk with APA Matsuyamajo Nishi Hotel View from my tenth-floor room an American gentleman who had been living in Japan on the JET Japanese English Teaching programme for five years and just next week is due to return home back to New York. He told me that the other small town which I planned to visit today Uko has actually been badly affected by the recent floods and landslides and that if I wanted to visit I should be prepared to be handed a shovel to help with the clean-up. Much as I would love to do something to help the locals with their clean-up after the devastating weather they have been having I am not too sure that this was to be part of my plan for the day. It did also help to slow me down for the day as well and after the train came and took me to Uchiko I enjoyed a lovely amble around the quiet town with only a few other Japanese tourists around. Incidentally I have not come across any hordes of Chinese tourists since I have been here what a great relief indeed after Kyoto. My walk around Uchiko involved a stroll through the Yokaichi Historic District to include the beautiful Kamihaga Residence APA Matsuyamajo Nishi Hotel My lovely room once belonging to the Kamihaga family who had made their fortune along with many others of the town in the production and exportation of high quality white wax. My wander also included a wonderful visit to the Uchiko-za kabuki theatre where although there was no kabuki performance traditional Japanese dance and drama theatre during my visit it was actually really quite beautiful to see. After a couple of hours I caught a train back to Matsuyama glad to have caught the one I did as the next one wasn’t for another three hours – it appears that not only are the trains here on Shikoku far less regular than on the mainland the recent floods and landslides have also caused parts of the track to be out-of-service and buses to replace some of the journeys. It seems the island of Shikoku was quite badly affected by the torrential rains earlier this month. Upon returning to Matsuyama I very much enjoyed another onsen in an entertainment building just opposite the station with around ten pools in total ranging from freezing cold to boiling hot with lots of bubbly ones too. I could very much get used to the Japanese onsen culture…! APA Matsuyamajo Nishi Hotel View from my room towards Matsuyama city centre and a rainbow after the typhoon has passed! My visit to the entertainment building also involved my first experience of the Japanese pinball-type game pachinko” which I played but had absolutely no idea what was going on apart from lots of small ball bearings bouncing their way down and ending up in a hole at the bottom…! I shall have to read up on the game instructions for this somewhere…! So I have returned to my hotel once more squeaky clean and writing up this blog entry for my wonderful adventures on the island of Shikoku. I have very much enjoyed my time here it has been fantastic to get off the beaten track for a bit and see a different more rural and relaxed side of Japan. Tomorrow I return once more to the tourist trail though I am very much looking forward to it. I plan to take a ferry from Matsuyama Port across the Inland Sea to the city of Hiroshima just north of here on Honshu. I hope to be able to write my next entry again from there in a few days’ time. I am looking forward to learning more about World War Two from the Japanese perspective there particularly as most APA Matsuyamajo Nishi Hotel Matsuyama of my education and understanding of the war have been focused on the European perspective. I am sure there will be much to learn while I am there. For now and until then I will end this one here. Thank you for reading and I wish everyone all the best.

Again another two weeks have passed and as usual we have been on the move ever so slowly up the NSW coast and are now at Alstonville. between Ballina and Lismore From Newcastle we moved on to Hallidays Point where a very good friend Helen manages the wonderful Beachfront Holiday Park. We had a great couple of days catching up and visiting all the little surrounding towns like Forster etc. Then it was on to Nambucca Heads and the White Albatross Holiday Park where we have stopped a couple of times before because we just love the spot. After a few days we moved on to Yamba and the Calypso Holiday park to visit another friend Leanne and Mat for a few days. Yamba is a great little spot and it was great to catch up with Leanne plus have a good look around the town. As mentioned we are now at Alstonville and have been here for a week catching up with my brother Raymond and sister Isabelle plus check out the surrounding areas like Lismore Wardell and Ballina etc. While here we went to the Ballina Cherry Street Bowles club for Sunrise at Hallidays Point dinner and to watch/listen to a group called The Hillbilly Goats which are very much a Bluegrass type band. I would totally recommend you go see them if you ever get the chance as they put on a great show. Today we are off the Lennox Head to visit an Aunt who we havent seen in years to catch up and talk old times. I have spent the last couple of days relaxing as tomorrow we move on to Mullumbimby for a couple of weeks to visit my younger sister Joy and Darren. Joy has just bought a fruit shop in Mullumbimby and has lined up quite a few jobs for me to do around the place. Just what I need to get back into fitness again.

I made my way to krabi Airport by scooter then minivan after I turned it in. Had a good flight to Bangkok and found my way to the city link rail. I had booked a hostel in the new city center. After walking the final kilometer I found these luxurious beds pic. I checked out the city at night and I must say I like it better than the previous time. The hustle and bustle is a little more.. Sedated. Theres night markets. The smog is not nearly as bad. The pretty lights give the city a new and interesting perspective. I followed the largest road in the world for quite a bit and returned by skytrain. The street is full of small stands but also ginormous shopping malls and plazas. A few buildings had impressive names on the walls with expensive cars in the parking lot. Christmas music bares from speakers that are cleverly hidden throughout the area. The hedge is dressed better than most Christmas trees I know.. Next day shopping. I wont bore you with the details but I found that the enormous pratunam market that I Theres 10 or so baggage belts here. Its huge! planned my hostel close to was mostly a clothing thing and didnt have much to bring home. I read up on markets again. Most of them are night markets but theres a few others. Chatanuk market is the biggest market in the world but its a weekend market. The internet says theres a smaller market on weekdays too so.. Lets see. It took me another ride on the sky train and a long walk to find out they only sell flowers /. But theres 3 buildings nearby that are supposed to have stalls indoor. First one. Only furniture and decorations. Second one. 3 or 4 floors with all kinds of junk. Upscale antiques to aquaria. Took an hour found nothing of interest.Third one. Same thing but bigger. Only one floor though. Got a few knick-nacks because I was running out of time. Found one more market close by and walked there. This is a good time to mention how much time it costs to get to places. Just crossing the street requires you to find a stairs and walkway or when available wait a couple of minutes at a traffic light for both sides of the road. I spent Bangkok at night Sukhomvit road 45 minutes Getting from where I was just before a T-junction on the left side to the far side of the horizontal part of the T because I thought I had to cross it from the right side of the road instead of the left and had to double back. Incidentally it was a food market. Bought a ticket to the metro to get to another shopping location. Got out walked around. Turns out this is also a night Market and theres nothing during the day. Onwards! My final destination was a the BKS center. An huge indoor shopping mall with several floors not too far from my hostel. It has crafts clothing electronics food banks you name it. I finally found what I was looking for an hurried back to the hostel to pick up my backpack and on to the rail link train. I added a map with my travels trough Bangkok as part of the whole way back to amsterdam. The airport gave me some trouble. I was all standing ready for the security theater show when they would not allow my powerbank 50k mAh listed. Theres a One of those big name buildings with the cars and the dressed up hedge local policy stating you cant bring one over 32. Im pretty sure it wont even get to half that when I bought it and after 5 years I think it goes with half of that. But yeah no arguing with airport officials.. If you were wondering. On the flight in it was on my backpack in checked luggage. Had totally forgotten about it actually. There was some sign saying powerbanks should be in you cabin luggage so I thought Id oblige this time... Sigh. Next problem was a little slip of paper they added to my passport on the way here. I was supposed to fill it out but hadnt. The customs official sent me away instead of borrowing me a pencil so I could do the 5 lines of data while he worked with the next person. A little less zen than when I started got in line a second time and had no trouble getting trough. I write this from gate 47 in Hong Kong where I still have to wait 1h30 for the gate to open. I expect no further events of note so unless I feel really inspired or get some nice photos Another one from others to share I guess I call this the final chapter 😊 Thanks for your attention and see you ..

TEMPLE BOATRUN AND TEMPLE IN THE TREE. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Thailand Master Chef Thai Culinary School Advertisement Asia » Thailand » Central Thailand » Ampawa June 22nd 2014 Published June 24th 2014Edit Blog Post Xeaman Temple boat run in Amphawa-36 Young musician After I had some fruit I had a bit of energy to do a boat ride. There were different prices for the sight seeing boat rides. 50 THB for a regular sight seeing. It was 500 THB for 5 temples and 900THB for 9 temples. I didn’t feel like doing any temples at all. I just wanted to see the temple in the three. But I could ‘t ask anyone in English. I understood you have to go to the more expensive rides to see the temple in the tree. I wasn’t motivated enough and I decided to go for the basic sightseeing tour. I took the 50 THB one. I was surprised to find out that it stops at temples too. I stepped of the boat at the first 2 but after that I was burned under the sun and stayed on the boat. Im glad I did because when the boats drop people off they pull off the floating docks and I got some great action watching from there. I was fascinated watching people order bowls of noodles off a lady on a wooden boat. This short video is a bit far away but It gives you a Temple boat run in Amphawa-21 mini zoo by the temple in the tree bit of perspective. I snapped it quickly while I was trying to photograph kids waiting for their food!! To see the video pls click here But I started to think what If I am missing the temple in the tree. I showed the kids on my boat a photo of the temple on the tree and they said Next stop! Cool so I was going to get to see it after all. It’s hard to find and I was lucky the kids took me. It is crazy busy and difficult to take photos but I did my best. The highlights were an awl on the three and kids playing traditional instruments. That was awesome. I went to leave them money and I noticed that my bills had disappeared. It wasn’t much 200 THB. I don’t know how. I keep my backpack with the zipper towards my body. But all I had left was change. I felt bad I couldn’t deposit money in the jar of the young musicians. They were incredible and I was so burnt by the sun I didn’t think of recording the music. Bummer. The boat ride was longer than I expected. We had Temple boat run in Amphawa-13 Carefully seasoning the noodle soup 15 minutes in each stop at least 4 stops and 40 minutes at the tree with the temple. There was also minizoo at the stop of the temple in the tree. There were kids feeding the animals and pretty quickly I forgot about the temple. I saw the cutest little girl trying to pet the rabbits through the wire net. After that I was done for the day. I went back to my papaya salad place and then up to the station where the van towards Bangkok stops. Once there it started pooring rain. I got my poncho out. Im so glad I keep it with me. It has saved my camera a few times already. The van from Amphawa to Bangkokg was 80 THB. I boarded at 330 and arrived at Lumphini MTR at 7pm. I took 3hrs and 30 minutes to get back. I was soaked. My walking shoes were disgusting. I stoped at the vendors in the corner and order chicken noodle soup that wasn’t that great but it was enogh to warm me up and a beer. I took a shower and now Im catching up with my typing while Temple boat run in Amphawa-20 Boat captain ...very camera friendly   I download nearly 1000 shots taken over the weekend. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 36 Displayed 24 « Back 1 2 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 15 Message Cruising the Seven Seas Xeaman Another Amateur Travel Photographer that is here wants to go there and ends up somewhere else…. ... full info Joined November 2nd 2007 Trips 12 Last Login September 17th 2019 Followers 15 Status BLOGGER Follows 2 Blogs 346 Guestbook 286 Photos 5535 Forum Posts 25 blog=846710 blogger=51678 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=846710 blogger=51678 Advertisement Trips Oahu HI January 9th 2013 -» March 2nd 2013 Florida Divemaster/Dive Con Capt.

The water pressure in the hotel was amazing! The breakfast spread was even more so! A buffet probably twice as long as my kitchen. Cereal several types of meet and breads hummus pancakes potatoes lots of pastries including chocolate crescents! There was also some sort of soup/stew and rice. And teeny tiny glass jars of jelly and ketchup. We may have put them in our suitcase. We started our journey back to the metro. But we found the mall wasn’t open at 6am. Sounds pretty reasonable to me. So we had to walk around the mall to find the metro. Parking garage. There’s light over there! Nope. Still part of the mall just with no roof. That looks like a street let’s head that way. Still mall. We walked a TON. Finally we found it and made our way back to the airport. During our time here last night and this morning I saw lots of words on buildings that I recognized as names of people I know at home! Majd. Alrifai. I realized as I was seeing things in the daylight that I kept thinking I can’t More desert wait to tell Tato about this and show it to him!” He was so little when I was on the road and traveling a lot so everything that was new to me was something I tried to tell him about. He first learned about time zones when I called him on his 7th birthday from Germany and he was eating breakfast but I had just finished dinner! I hope he travels with me soon! Checked in nothing eventful. Though I did get really excited as we neared the terminal because there were a lot of Africans around. Duh! We were heading to Uganda! I had a window seat and took pics of Dubai and Entebbe from the air. So different! Uneventful flight until a pretty hard landing. Moses was there to greet us and all our bags arrived. Moses is the executive director of Bold Ventures the NGO we are meeting up with. He’ll be our guide for the next 10 days. He took us to a guesthouse so we could rest. We got some chips and I started messaging ACC friends. Auntie Harriet came to meet us for dinner! It was lovely to get Jungle! to chat and catch up with her. I’m going to try to see some of the kids as well. Well apparently they are adults now since it has been 11 years. I made sure Becca knew what to do with her mosquito net and the basin where the shower should be. It’s a bit surreal that I’m here. It feels familiar somehow. I’m so excited for the week ahead!

I left it at the Louvre. I saw so much pain love and struggle in the magnificent art that it had reverberated and grown within me. The beauty and darkness had become a part of me. In its catharsis the artists had toppled my walls and shared with me the raw power of creation. And then I had left that relationship inside the chambers of the Louvre. I visited another famous cemetery Montparnasse where I paid homage to more fallen artists such as Samuel Beckett and Jean-Paul Sartre on the way out of the city of lights and had a final delicious lunch. I was heavy. I was overwhelmed with the struggle of the artists and the sensitivity of the passions that had driven to the creation of such masterpieces that the museum had collected. The Muse um . My conclusion from seeing all the creative projects was that I had to follow my passion. My life depended on it. I titled my work write or die and started tapping away on my laptop. As I wrote on the plane the words flowed -like a spring river purging the clogged dry ground- Santa Lucia & Me and I sobbed. My heaviness finally and slowly lifted as the plane soared above the clouds southbound to the Catalan Capital. I found a new lightness in myself that I would bring into Barcelona. The electricity called from the proud city of party animals great food free thinking and rad architecture. Many a friend had told me that Barcelona is the place for me. I never had the opportunity to experience it until that mid July day. As much as I prefer a natural peaceful environment the buzz lives in the walls of captivity. To quote Trey Anastasio the song composer from Phish Theres some good points some bad points... But it all works out Im just a little freaked out... Find your city find yourself a city to live in! I discovered a great hostel in a mellower part of the city a short walk from the center. Casa de Gracia had a setup of tapas spanish snacks sangria and live flamenco dancing my first night and I tripped out on the coolness factor. Not only were the performers awesome but the locals were great the girls were hot and every traveler was cheerful around Girls Crazy City & Gaudi me as well. I had found my city. The first night I bonded with a group of fellow Americans who had been in Ibiza and were witnesses to the running of the bulls. We went down to the ocean clubs. There was seafood sand and blurs of drunkenness. Not to brag but every single night there was a different opportunity to have love and freedom with European women that were passionately enjoying the life of leisure. I mean one day I went on a bike ride with 15 college aged girls and me.... Lucky Josh. Most nights I would find different cliques as I moved to other parts of the great city and experienced varied activities. This was midsummer in Europe and I was living it. My kidneys were relieved when I opted to go onto an excursion to the Costa Brava and enjoy the ocean and kayaking. We loaded into a van and zoomed down to a Catalan town called Sant Feliu De Guixols. The town on the sea has a classical monastery and the locals speak mostly the Catalan language which sounds a lot like French. The sea was bluer than blue and a El Catedral tad bit on the brisk side. We jumped off cliffs into deep caverns. We snorkeled. We toured to small inlets and private beaches resembling a European version of Thailands The Beach. The pinnacle of the kayak tour for me was the end. We were taken to inlets only reachable by boat. There were super high cliffs with a very small takeoff point to jump into the Mediterranean blue-green. Since nobody stepped up to the challenge I clambered up first as everyone watched. The Hawaii ocean boy in me came alive and after being about 60 feet high I climbed another 8 feet. With no time to think I leaped forward to free fall into the water! It was fun. Everyone followed suit after me and soonafter we kayaked back to land. Too quick it was time to leave the sun-kissed paradise and venture back to the city. There were still lessons to be learned in Catalonia. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Josh Margulies travelsurfer After traveling the world 16 countries over 5 continents 14 new US states writing and taking numerous photos I am always asked whats your favorite place?.

I learned a few things about the plan I purchased. First it covers the death of relatives as far out as cousins and some in-laws. Secondly it did not cover any additional costs to delay your trip unless it has begun if the new price is more. Mine happened to be because the studio cabin on the NCL Epic was sold out for the new date but I was only to rearrange some of my dates so I bit the bullet and bought a double cabin for a single price. Third with the obituary Delta Airlines would change the ticket for me at no additional charge. Nice! The original hotels in Barcelona were sold out for the new dates so had to pay a lot extra to get into a good hotel. Delta Airlines Economy Comfort is very nice for long haul flights. There is 4 more pitch and 4 more legroom free cocktails I dont drink on planes but full bottles of water if you wanted them. Eat and if you order a special meal mine is DSCN1426 diabetic you are served first watch a movie sleep and youre in Amsterdam. That airport if not set up for people with tight connections. There are no boards showing connecting gates until you get to the terminal youre supposed to be going to. My boarding pass didnt show a gate so it was a maze of confusion trying to find out where my connection was leaving from to Barcelona. I made the KLM flight from Terminal 2 a pretty crowded 737 but had a window which was nice to continue my sleep. KLM serves the same sandwiches on every flight Ive been on with them. Its filling but boring. The cookie after the snack is more memorable than the meal. I woke up and chatted with a lovely Malaysian couple from Penang going to BCN for a medical conference. I still wonder if they were returning on MH17. They were so nice but sad that their country is now known for the disappearing plane. Little did we know there would be another major disaster just a few weeks later. On arrival at the Barcelona Airport my private transfer arranged by Expedia was smooth as could be. A nice Russian driver DSCN1427 who spoke English perfectly met me outside customs helped with the baggage. It is a perk I give to myself after long hauls so I dont get into any trouble with jet lag. Hotel 1898 is a gorgeous historic hotel right on Las Ramblas. Its great location is just two blocks from La Boqueria on Las Ramblas a great spot to get an inexpensive snack or meal. That being said weve all read about pickpockets and crime in Barcelona. Traveling as a solo woman I felt very safe and secure here. Their safety system is one of the best Ive ever seen outside New York. Your room key must be used to get up the elevator and only takes you to your floor or the public floors. Not to mention the bellman was on watch to see that you belonged here. The interlock mechanism is built into the wall next to the door so less chance of anyone using a code reader to open your door while youre away. With dark hardwood floors and spacious rooms I thought it might be noisy from above but it wasnt a bit. The bath is well appointed with a bidet. There is DSCN1428 a large safe big enough for a laptop or iPad. Anytime I travel I leave my Do Not Disturb sign on the door at all times but turn it to Make Up My Room when I want service and usually get it within the time Im out. I dont care for turn down service so up goes the DND sign again. Since I had arrived from the West Coast my time schedule was upside down falling into bed early before most restaurants open in Barcelona 800pm - 1000pm. I ordered Room Service the food was fresh too plentiful and the full meal deal was 21 Euros including salad and dessert & service charge. You can walk anywhere in Barcelonas core from here Catalyuna Square the Cathedral Picasso Museum waterfront. I never took the subway but there is a stop 1/2 block away. My taxi to the cruise ship pier was 15 minutes and 15 Euros more because of some heavy traffic and the meter goes by time and travel distance. The rooftop pool is an oasis amid the craziness of this beautiful city. I only ordered local wine and beer and felt the prices were on par with any other DSCN1429 big city hotel. There is a Starbucks in the same building which made the breakfast plan unnecessary so had my coffee and rolls there. I had a half body massage in the spa the girls speak English very well. I used the indoor pool which has a waterfall massage jetted section so more like a spa than swimming pool very relaxing. Maybe thats why I fell into bed and slept restfully amid the chaos of Las Ramblas. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message MONichols MONichols I wish I had started this long long ago.

Its a long late stretch that seems really nice because it makes winter itself feel much shorter. We were however very ready to see some beautiful colors so Rani and I took a somewhat spontaneous two-day trip up to the northern-most part of the Honshu island which is Aomori prefecture. The 9 hour trip by car took us only 3 hours by shinkansen and I will never stop being amazed at how convenient it is. I always bring a train beer now and I can sit and drink and listen to music as the bullet train whisks me off to faraway parts of the country. Technology at its finest! We left Friday afternoon after work and had a bit of a SNAFU trying to find each other at Tokyo Station. I never take the shinkansen from here because I am always going west rather than north and as such its faster and easier to catch the train at Shin-Yokohama. So we did a little dance of attempting to track each other down outside different ticket gates 005 but we eventually made it. We got our tickets and hopped on the Hayabusa the fastest Tohoku shinkansen that took us straight up north to Shin-Aomori. There with some sprinting to catch the only Ou line train for the next 40 minutes we finished our trip to Aomori Station with a short local train. We had decided to stay near Aomori Station due to getting in late that night and our hostel was a stones throw away from the station itself. The woman who checked us in and helped us was incredibly sweet and warm and the hostel itself had nice yukata and some towels for us along with traditional futon bedding. We were exhausted so the hot shower and comfy futon felt amazing! Our alarm woke us up at 630 the next morning sleeping in for both of us ugh adulthood and we set out to catch the infrequent bus that runs from Aomori Station into Lake Towada 十和田湖 towadako. Its a three-hour bus ride but we werent taking it the whole way and unlike buses in the city the bus only sells as many tickets as there are seats - so you dont have to stand. 006 We took the bus only an hour to Mt. Haddoka a peak with a ropeway and brilliant autumn colors surrounding the base. Unfortunately for us our plans to hike around the summit were thwarted by the dense fog that lowered visibility to 0 and the rain that turned to sleet and ice by the time we reached the top via cable car due to the fact that it was 2.5 degrees Celsius. Cold!! This was a bummer but the colors themselves were better at the bottom anyway so we just decided to skip the hike there and head back down. We caught an earlier bus than anticipated to continue towards Lake Towada and stopped at Ishigedo which is the beginning of the Oirase Stream 奥入瀬. Oirase is a long easily walkable stream that feeds into Lake Towada and is famous for its autumn colors. There were many other people here hoping to get some good photos of the foliage and we planned to walk the entire length of the stream to the end a stop called Nenokuchi. We made about 7km of it before it started to rain again. Oirase itself was beautiful and brimming with color. The 007 trail is dotted with waterfalls of varying size and width so it was a gorgeous location without the fall colors and even better with them. The rain and cool temperatures kept perhaps most of the tourists away because we saw other people but never an abundance of them which was surprising to me. Most of the people we did see were the old people on the tours riding in their massive buses altogether and following the flag-holding guides. We did the last 2km in the rain and were completely soaked and freezing by the time we reached the last waterfall. It was another 1.6km or so until Nenokuchi but there was a bus stopping by in 15 minutes and we decided to forego the remainder of the stream to get out of the rain. The bus dropped us off at Lake Towada in the main settlement called Yasumiya which was 80% tourism revolving around the lake itself. We got some much-needed lunch and then went out to do a brief bit of exploring before finding our hostel a 5-minute walk from the lakeside. Our hostel was really really nice. Again the staff there was incredibly kind and accommodating 008 and I had some nice conversations with them in Japanese. We didnt have any towels which was honestly the only bad point but we did have a heater in our room that worked like a charm. This was good since it was pretty cold at night and it was a shock to our summer-soaked systems. We actually fell asleep before 8pm which is hilarious and sad all at the same time - and we slept until the next morning at 7am! Sunday was a sunny and beautiful day so the weather was much better. During breakfast traditional Japanese breakfast the hostel provided we noticed a sign that said free bicycle rentals for hostel guests and went to inquire at the desk about it. The staff not only were immediately out to get us bikes but also stored our bags for us so we wouldnt have to ride with our packs on. The man working the front desk got us two bikes from the shed and we set off to go around the lake a bit. We couldnt do it all since the lake is the third-largest lake in Japan with a circumference of 44km! We went about 9km 010 around and then started hitting some major hills and our bikes were not made for that mine didnt even have any other speeds haha so that was the point when we turned back around. The ride was GORGEOUS and absolutely perfect to do in the morning - the temperature was nice the traffic wasnt bad along the road we were following and the foliage was beautiful. Really a great idea Im so glad we discovered it was an option! Along the lake there was a picturesque coffee shop with about three tables total so we stopped in to get some coffee and warm up a bit. The owner there was really kind as well and we ran into a photography group taking pictures around the area. Then we biked a bit more on the promenade stopped for more pictures and finally swung back up to return the bicycles to the hostel. As soon as they saw us coming they brought our bags out for us so we wouldnt have to take our shoes off again. And told us about the bus back the times and the boat tour which was our next stop anyway. Great hostel staff! The 011 boats depart every half hour and are 50-minute long sight-seeing loops around the far right side of the lake. I took some motion sickness medicine so we were safe and we departed on our boat with the best seats in the house right at the front so we could see out the huge windows. The mountains and hills surrounding Lake Towada were in full display of beautiful colors and it was so pretty to see the scope of the lake from a different vantage point. The boat tour ended and we did some omiyage souvenir shopping and ate delicious local foods on sticks then had lunch before getting back on the bus. Because I had done some research I discovered that going back through Hachinohe Station was better as the bus ride was only 2 hours as opposed to the 3 back to Aomori Station and that the shinkansen also stops there cutting our bullet train trip by 30 minutes. Still it was a 2 hour bus ride plus a nearly 3 hour shinkansen ride back to Tokyo and then another hour on the local trains to get back to my apartment. Quite a long travel time right at 012 the end but really worth it because it was so wonderful! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 86 Displayed 27 « Back 1 2 3 4 5 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Katy katybug English teacher living in Japan teaching at a private high school in Tokyo.

And happy Earth day - Its been over three months since I landed in Australia and you may be wondering how far Ive gotten in that time... Well prepare to be disappointed ! In those three months I spent a total of 3 days on my bike and covered the not so impressive distance of 250 kilometers ! And youll also have noticed that Ive been more or less off the radar during this time a few photos posted on Facebook but no blog updates.... So what have I been up to ? Well... Ive been WWOOFing. For most of that time at least. WWOOF is a world wide organisation linking itinerant workers ie. me to organic farms and small properties who need a few extra pairs of hands. The setup is as follows  you do 4 hours of manual labour each day and in exchange you get accommodation and food. Because of the nature of these places organic farms small holdings family homes you get to meet some great people with whom you can share some of your interests such as gardening and sustainable living for example. Thus back in January after a lovely 3 Smudge !!!! week stay with my auntie Meg my second cousin once removed to be precise I made my way down to Palmvale near Murwillumbah to meet my very first WWOOFing hosts Neil and Kitty. For the next 2 months I got to know these lovely people and the various other WWOOFers also there and spent my days out on their beautiful property planting native rainforest trees. I must say that I have great admiration for their commitment to reforest the 120 acres of their property most of which was dairy pastures when they got there. The beauty of the region also contributed to my desire to stop there for so long. The Northern New South Wales area boasts an amazing coastline with Byron Bay being one of the highlights. Inland the impressive Mount Warning made for a great biking/hiking/climbing expedition. I went one afternoon and set up camp on the very summit dont tell anyone though ! and returned to Murwillumbah the next morning. One of Mount Warnings claims to fame is that it receives the first rays of sunshine in Australia every morning. Sadly the famous sunrise was totally obscured from me as the mountaintop was in the clouds for Palmvale most of the night and morning. But I did however get a good view over the valley and the Pacific ocean a little later on when the fog parted briefly. When the time came for me to leave Murwillumbah and head on south it was difficult to part with everyone. Two months had felt like a very long time to me as Id not stopped anywhere else for anywhere near that length of time on this trip and as Id very quickly felt at home in Palmvale. Ive now been staying with Alex Megs son and my second cousin near Lismore for a couple of weeks. Its been good to meet all these relatives I never knew I had ! A whole new branch of the family tree has opened up to me ! And to think that were all descendants of the good Reverand Reginald Bati Bartlett OBE my great grandfather and missionary in Samoa and Papua New Guinea ! Anyway cutting to the chase tomorrow is when the trip really gets going. No more dilly-dallying. Im off to Tasmania ! Ive no more relatives to call upon and I wont be doing any more WOOFing for Smudge overlooking his territory a while. Its time for some real bike touring. Lugging that behemoth of a bike of mine up and down those hills all day and finding a discreet spot to camp wild every night. Im hoping to get some real distance covered in the coming weeks  maybe as far as Sydney within the next month and possibly Melbourne before the end of June... but lets not get carried away yet... well see how it goes. See you in a few days when I get back online to complain to you of my sore legs and the numbness of my behind !

Isnt it dangerous? What about the Palestinians the wall Gaza? Why go youre not religious? Well Jerusalem isnt the little town Id read about in the bible as a child. It is a modern city with traffic jams and super-trams. But there are so many names we half-remember. The Mount of Olives offers us a great view of the old city. The Garden of Gethsemane still contains olive trees. There are also sites and names that we remember from more recent news programs. Getting to the Al Aksa mosque and the Dome of the Rock requires queuing and being security screened. The same is true to visit the western or wailing wall. But it is all very civilised and polite. Three religions have a claim a need to be involved in the life of Jerusalem. Significant events in Jesuss life occurred here including the last supper his trial death and burial. Mohammed ascended to heaven from Temple Mount the same location as Judaism’s first temple. Everywhere we see Jewish Haredi men dressed in their traditional long black coat and trousers white shirt and a black wide-brimmed tzitzit hat. Old Jerusalem They are queuing at the bus stops carrying home the shopping heading for work taking the kids to school. We spend a day wandering around the old city all little lanes souks and tiny shops. There are tourist sites around every corner ... and tourists too. Every site is busy and this is not peak season. Many of the sites are stunning and one has to respect the joy that visiting them brings to the faithful. There are churches of every denomination but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre containing Jesuss tomb is tricky. The church is claimed by Roman Catholic Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches so they administer the church jointly. But the keys are held by a neutral Muslim family who unlock the church every morning. We drive across into Bethlehem in Palestine. We go through a checkpoint in the wall – a huge ugly wall like all political walls – and enter the West Bank. You may think the West Bank is Palestinian but in reality less than 20% of the West Bank is governed by the Palestinian Authority. Strangely going through the wall only gets us into the Israeli governed West Bank. Reading in the synagogue Further down the road into Bethlehem we finally enter the Palestinian governed West Bank – but here there is no wall no checkpoint nothing to tell us. Confused? Even the locals we are told are confused. Bethlehem is of course where Jesus was born and we visit the church that was built over that spot. It is strange to visit a site so venerated by so many people. Bethlehem today is a busy little town and feels very different to Jerusalem. It feels very Arabic and is of course largely Muslim. We enter and leave the West Bank three times always easily quickly and without incident. When in the West Bank we never know who is governing the land we are on and generally nor do the guides. Predictably our Palestinian and Israeli guides have different views and use different language about the situation. The Palestinian seems more open to questions the Israeli more defensive. Interestingly our Israeli guide tells us he cannot enter Palestinian Bethlehem. Even before the Crusades Christian visitors came here to seek out the places they knew from the bible. Often they would build a church where the biblical event took place Church of the Nativity and inevitably there was some guesswork. The actual location of many miracles will never be known but this probably doesnt matter. Up in northern Israel we are again on disputed land – the Golan Heights. Once Syrian these hills were occupied by Israel in 1967 after Israel had suffered years of indiscriminate bombardment from the hills. The road is very close to the new border the valley to our left is in the Lebanon. High in the misty hills we turn south-west. Just a kilometre to our left is war-torn Syria. There are still signs of the war here - bits of tank by the roadside cordoned off mine fields. The kibbutz where we sleep has warning sirens and a shelter last used when Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel. Twice during our time here the sirens have sounded – just drills we are assured. We sail across the Sea of Galilee and then lunch on the shore fish of course. It’s a nice change from falafel or shwarma. The food has been good here but rather more expensive than the UK.

It still has a lot of alternative lifestylers there selling pottery and organic food etc. with long haired weirdo’s walking around in bare feet trying to look cool! The hemp cafe stunk of weed when we walked past! Pete was even asked if he would like to buy a joint! Next stop was a Sunday market selling much of the same thing. Best part of the day was travelling through some beautiful countryside which looked so green after the last two rainy days. The town of Lismore was our stop yesterday. A quiet place but with plenty of shops airport and a shopping mall. Bought a new Navman GPS as we were unable to update our old one. Still the same old voice but she is now a lot smarter and has not instructed us to go in the wrong direction once today. We also purchased a wireless tyre pressure monitor unit to automatically check all the 6 wheels on the RV whilst travelling on the road. We have had a couple of faulty valves recently causing the tyres Huge rocks to pass through Bald Rock Nat. Park to leak air so this little device with the not so little price tag I may add will hopefully alert us to any problems in the future. Third acquirement was a CB radio and aerial so that when those big road trains are heading towards us then we will know way before we see them! Also if we do break down then hopefully we will be able to contact someone. Last week an experienced park ranger died in the outbacks when he got bogged. He strangely enough decided to walk out but did not make it! Off tramping in a couple of National parks tomorrow as the weather is now hot and sunny once more. Bad start to the day as we had a flat tyre! Fortunately we were camped in a little one horse town that at least had a garage so were able to get some help. The instructions to take off the spare wheel located under the RV were incorrect so Pete spent a frustrating amount of wasted time before the mechanic arrived. We are now confident that should it happen again it hopefully will not be too much of a headache. It could have been Boulders on Bald Rock track Bald Rock Nat. Park a lot worse as it could have happened where we are tonight which is in the middle of a national park and a long way from a garage so all turned out well in the end. The bird life is amazing here as they are used to campers feeding them tit bits and even pinch food if they can get away with it. There are lots of Kookaburras and bright red crimson parrots. Tomorrow we are going to climb Bald Rock Australia’s biggest granite monolith! Sounds impressive but it is only a 2 hour return walk! Well the walk was amazing and the granite boulders on top of the rock seemed to be so precariously balanced on the edge like huge marbles waiting to be rolled! Now currently in Armidale a really interesting town with impressive old buildings and even a university. We went on a 3 hour free trip on a small bus along with 12 others courtesy of the local council around the city which was very informative. The free nearyby campsite we are at by a dam is lovely and we have had enjoyed some great happy hours with the folks next door. Visited an Bald Rock track on way down! Bald Rock Nat. Park amazing old 30 room homestead that was gifted to the National Trust in 1984. No one in the family wanted to take over the mammoth task involved in the restoration and upkeep so now it is open to the public. The old lady the last of the owner’s daughters did absolutely nothing to it from 1970 when it was left to her and all the furniture carpet wallpaper is the original stuff. The guided tour was so interesting and to top it off we enjoyed Devonshire tea with scones and jam and cream of course in the adjacent cafe! Unfortunately our plan to attend the local rodeo has been put off due to the weather. We will I am sure come across another one in another town. Pete wants to see someone being chased by an angry bull or being bucked off a horse! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 9 Displayed 9 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 1 Message Suzanne Walmsley Kruizing Kiwiz 4 August 2012 - Peter and Suzanne being of the Baby Boomers generation are now setting forth on the next travel phase of our lives.

Somewhat exhausted due to the Brazilian guy barging in in the middle of the night me and Ante managed to drag ourselves out of bed and down to the street where Laia true to her word was waiting for us with her car. Its about an hour or so drive from Sabadell to Montserrat and me and Ante did our best to stay awake to talk to Laia who was also tired since she rarely goes up this early in the morning so it was a generally pretty tired party heading into the mountains on this morning. Laia was also looking forward to going to Montserrat since she had never actually been there despite being able to see it from her parents house on a good day. The drive up the mountain went well even though Laias poor car struggled at the worst elevations. We parked in the paid parking lot before the entrance to the monastery Santa Maria de Montserrat. It was founded in 880 and is still in function today with roughly some 70 or so monks living there. Parking was free for the first half hour and then 6.50 euro for the Montserrat rest of the day when Laia double checked this after couple of hours she saw that this was instead 6.50 euro per half hour after the first which kind of made us a bit sweaty as that bill would tack on pretty quickly but me and Ante said it would be fine and that the two of us would split the parking bill. The view from up here is absolutely gorgeous pretty much regardless of where you stand the surroundings will take your breath away and we just found ourselves standing in awe at the view before we made our way to the Santa Maria de Montserrat to see what the monastery itself looked like on the inside. It took a while though to get some decent pictures of the view because a whole lot of Chinese tourists kept barging into the picture not caring in the least about us trying to take some pictures or waiting their turn like the rest of us did to be honest it got rather annoying after a while. Unfortunately its not allowed to photograph inside the actual basilica only on the courtyard and at the entry. I managed to snap a Santa Maria de Montserrat couple of quick photos though before the guard noticed me and I had to power down. Its a shame because its really gorgeous on the inside and I wish I could have taken some good photos of it. After our visit to the abbey we discussed for a bit on how to progress. Me and Laia wanted to take a walk up to Ermita de Sant Joan hermitage of saint John the Baptist and Ermita de Sant Onofre hermitage of saint Onuphrius. Laias friend had run up there a while back and said it would take an hour or two to get there by walking and that it was a beautiful route. Ante didnt want to walk any more but wanted to take the funicular instead. We finally settled on walking up and and if we were to tired afterwards take the funicular back down. We certainly werent alone in this decision there were several people walking upwards but we met very few going downwards. I guess that steep climb really sucked the energy out of everyone especially when doing it under this scorching sun. There were pretty much no shade for most of the walk and I Montserrat didnt even have any water so I drank a lot before we got started and then just took an occasional sip from Antes and Laias bottles. I guess they got a bit tired of me also dragging them on a few sidetracks such as going out to the Creu de Sant Miquel a tall cross that stands on a beautiful vantage point. We also visited a small church known as Sant Miquel. I often found myself walking some 10 to 20 metres ahead of Ante and Laia who held a slower pace. But I thought it was actually a positive thing for one it gave me plenty of time to find good spots for some nice photo shoots which also gave us some nice respites from the walking and it also gave Ante some time alone with someone other than me hopefully giving him ample opportunity to practice his conversational skills. As for the sidetracks I led us on I really do recommend the one leading to the Creu de Sant Miquel because you get an unbeatable view down over the monastery from its vantage point. The small Sant Miquel near it is also very beautiful unfortunately we Montserrat couldnt go inside since its only open for certain ceremonies a few times a year but at least we found some brief respite from the sun under its protruding roof. The part after the church is where I really started to give Ante and Laia a bit of space to themselves up until we were almost at the funicular station. Once we were closing in on it I waited for them at a place where we managed to find a bit of shade and we all shared a warm bottle of cola that Laia found in her backpack it was delicious at the time. From the funicular station there is a short walk further up to actually reach the hermitage and so it was another bit of discussion on whether or not to go for it but thankfully we ended up reaching for it under the promise to only go there and no further. Said and done once we reached the hermitage we turned back and went down to the funicular station. We couldnt buy tickets at the station though but Laia got us a ride down anyway and then we could buy our tickets at the lower Beautiful Swan station. Laia paid for all of them which was really sweet of her! As we were leaving I offered to pay the parking bill and then me and Ante would settle it all afterwards it turned out that we were lucky and it was as Laia had first thought with only 6.5 euro parking for the whole day so it was a lot cheaper than the 65 or so euro that I had expected! I told them that it had been a lot cheaper and that me and Ante would pick up the dinner tab as well once we got down to the village below so we drove back down the mountain and went into a lovely restaurant where we really splurged with lots of delicious food ice cream melons coffee drinks beer and so on. It was heavenly after a full day of trekking up the mountainside! With our bellies full we got back in the car and returned to Sabadell after a full day of walking under the sun and in a food induced coma I quite quickly fell asleep but Ante stayed awake and kept Laia company during our drive back. Once we reached Cutest Duckling Sabadell Laia asked if it was okay if she stayed with us for the rest of the day while we checked out Sabadell as well both me and Ante happily agreed to this as she is wonderful company. On her recommendation we started with a leisure time in Parc de Catalunya a lovely park at the heart of Sabadell. I was still more or less asleep and we just sat by the side of the artificial lake and fed the birds without really exploring the depths of the park. It was a really lovely time and it felt great to wind down and rest our legs. It was really cool to get the massive swans to eat out of my hand I usually dont go to near them not after one of them went into full aggression mode against me a few years back but this one behaved well enough. In the lake was also one of the cutest little ducklings ever born it was rushing around with the cutest quacks ever we all made sure a lot of food came his way without the larger ducks interfering. In the park there was also some available rental boats Parc de Catalunya and we saw some people out rowing but neither of us really felt up to that task we were all quite happy to just rest by the shore. We didnt move around much at all just walked a little around the lake until we finally felt rested enough and me and Ante wanted to see what Sabadell had to offer so we made our way into the centre to check out the church Sant Fèlix de Sabadell and Ajuntament de Sabadell the city hall. Especially the church is quite nice and certainly worth a closer look scattered around the city are also some really nice public drinking fountains adorned with statues of children the water tastes as bad as usual but the fountains are cool at least. During our walk we also took a look at the Vapor Buxeda Vell an old textile factory and the two beautiful churches Esglesia de limmaculat Cor de Maria and Parròquia de la Santíssima Trinitat. As the dark was beginning to fall we rounded out the day with some ice cream before Laia headed home and me and Ante went back to Jersons place. Both the American and Canadian girls had Sant Fèlix de Sabadell left we said our goodbyes this morning but the Brazilian guy was still there but kept to himself so I didnt really talk to him so it was Jerson Laila Ante and me who shared an evening meal before going to bed. Tomorrow we will return to Sweden without much ado since we leave fairly early and it will take a while to get from Sabadell to the airport Ill probably do a brief summary tomorrow but nothing to extensive. Until tomorrow I wish you all peace and happy travels! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 290 Displayed 28 « Back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Next » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 26 Message Per-Olof Persson A Small Swede in the Big World Im a small Swede that simply just love to travel.

Finding the Nike store we both picked up new shirts woohoo something different to wear. As I stood in the line four very rude young men butt right in front of me in line. I stood there simmering. As the guy at the counter called for the next person one of the young men from the group went right up to him. I tapped him on the arm and said Im next!. The nice cashier asked me if everything was alright. I replied that it was. Curtis then came over and I was telling him what happened. Again the nice man at the checkout asked Are you in a rush?. I replied that everything was great except that I did not like when people forced their way in front of others. He looked to the 4 young men to my right and said I completely understand. I like that you told them you were next. We then moved on to our transaction. As he inserted my VISA and it came up as to whether I wished to pay in euros or CAD I chose Canadian Gazpacho and Wine. funds. He said You are from Canada? We replied that we were. People from Canada are so nice. I have worked here for 4 years and have never met a rude one. Not like the young people we have here who lack etiquette. Whatever you do over there it is the right thing and we need to learn from you. What a sweet young man! We thanked him for his compliments and headed out. We then went to visit the High Parish Church of Santa Anna. This small but beautiful church is in the very heart of Barcelona. It was founded in 1141 by a group of Canons from the Holy Sepulchre. Today this beautiful monument remains hidden amongst the buildings which surround it. It has a beautiful cloister chapter house and cobble-stone square. We enjoyed the peace while we walked around the chapels that formed the periphery of this church. We left here and stumbled upon a quaint little restaurant Merce Vins. It was down a tiny Gothic street that looked very interesting. We stopped to look at the menu and they boasted two things a good Trip Advisor review AND the best gazpacho in Barcelona. Since Santa Marie Del Mar Jose told us we had to try this delectable cold soup we decided to go in. This adorable little hole in the wall restaurant turned out to be 2 floors of vibrantly coloured tables. Curtis had to be careful not to hit is head! We sat at a table on the 2nd floor where we enjoyed wine and truly the most delicious gazpacho! Not knowing what to expect but aware of the ingredients it was a culinary explosion to our senses. We enjoyed fresh bread with our soup and were so glad we stopped there! We continued on our way to the Santa Maria Del Mar Basilica. This basilica was likely started around the end of the 7th century but the cornerstone of the present temple was laid in March of 1329. The altar was made up of a semi-circle of 10 towering columns. It is hard to believe when you read the history of the church that in 1936 this beautiful place of worship burned for 11 days straight destroying the baroque altar and all of the images and historical archives. Restoration over the years has focussed on its elegant and Gothic style. The stained glass windows which Line up at Can Paixano remained undamaged were exquisite. We soon left this basilica and made our way back to the Can Paixano the same bar we visited yesterday however as we rounded the corner we were met with a huge line awaiting entry! We decided to wait and after about 15 minutes made our way into this authentic Catalunian bar. We battled the crowd and found a spot to stand. It is quite difficult to describe this place but I will do my best. Imagine 12 feet of space approximately 30 feet in length. Half of the width is dedicated to the food and drink preparation area which includes a counter cooking area and narrow space for the workers. The other half has a counter on part of the wall for patrons and then narrows to about 10 feet. There is a store at the back where you can buy meats cheeses and olives. Behind the counter in the narrow space are 8 men cooking washing dishes taking orders preparing and serving. You dont pay until you are leaving and somehow they are able to produce your bill completely correct in a room that is absolutely wall to wall people. The best part Well Worth the wait was being recognized by our server from the day before! We enjoyed an entire bottle of champagne a plate of olives and pickles grilled sausages and thinly sliced proscuitto all for 14 euros!!! This lively place is the epitome of Catalan culture accordiing to Jose but is quickly becoming popular with tourists as well hence the security outside and allowance of only so many in at a time. After organizing our bags for tomorrow morning we relaxed and cleaned up the apartment. Around 900 we went to a small restaurant at the end of our street called OToxo Tres Hermanos that we had passed many times going to and from our apartment. We enjoyed delicious paella on our last night in Spain. This place was very busy. I think we had an alien encounter there! As we sat at our table a man and woman came in and sat just over from us. He sat down and she bent down and began speaking into his ear with this high pitched yelping chanting alien-like voice. Ultra weird and kind of eerie. A look of bewilderment passed between us. She went off to the W.C. and then came back and sat Cava and Tapas down where we heard her talk in a normal voice. About 1/2 a minute later they both stood up she stole the cutlery from the table and they left! Maybe they needed the utensils to fix their mothership!! A very strange situation indeed considering they looked like normal everyday people. Tomorrow we leave for Avignon for 3 days! Looking forward to a new country and all it has to offer. Barcelona. We love it! There is so much to see and do. This history is extensive interesting and colourful. The tapas and paella incredible. The markets are exciting and busy. Tapas bars are lively and crowded. Someday we will return. Let us know if you are interested.

Thanks for following our blog. It is such a great way to let people know of the wonderful places we have been able to visit as well as a means for us to keep a journal. On La Rambla there is a booth set up that is dedicated to offering different tours as well as selling FC Barcelona soccer tickets. We made our arrangements there paid got our tickets and were told where to meet the tour guides out front of the Hard Rock Cafe at the Plaza Catalunya. We are not huge fans of doing organized tours but we really wanted to get to Montserrat and it seemed to be difficult to arrange by trains so we opted for this tour and since we love wine as well!. Anyway there is a brochure at the booth that is called Castlexperience Wine Tours and Activities. You can google it and see all the different ones they offer and the cost. We decided on the 1/2 day Montserrat wine and tapas tour. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Im sure any of the ones they offer are great. The tour guides were very knowledgeable speaking impeccable English. We were fortunate to be in a small group perhaps because of the time of year and you may be lucky as well. The wine part takes place away from Montserrat at a castle winery. In our opinion it was worth the money. Hopefully if you decide to go you will enjoy it as well. They offer another one that includes a Catalan meal at a restaurant. Might be worth a try. My best advice to you is that depending on where you are staying and you are physically able walk around the city as much as possible. This is how you get the true feel for Barcelona. The couple on the wine tour with us had been there as long as we had and took the Metro to places they wanted to see. Metro is great but you miss so many things in between. We love walking along the streets map in hand. The beachfront and Port Vell is worth a visit. You have to try the Gazpacho too. It is delicious along with the paella. The restaurants on La Rambla offer good prices for meals but heading down the sidestreets is where you really find some wonderful spots to eat. Enjoy Barcelona!!

Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the Bani Yas in the late 18th century which also assumed control of Dubai. In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways. Into the mid-20th century the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of Al-Ain and Liwa and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city which was occupied mainly during the summer months. Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were at this time constructed of palm fronds barasti with the wealthier families occupying mud huts. The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the twentieth century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings. In 1939 Sheikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan granted petroleum concessions and oil was first found in 1958. At first oil money had a marginal impact. A few lowrise concrete buildings were erected and the first paved road was completed in 1961 but Sheikh Shakbut uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last took a cautious approach preferring to save the revenue rather than investing it in development. His brother Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi. The ruling Al Nahyan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country. On August 6 1966 with the assistance of the British Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler.8 With the announcement by the UK in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf area by 1971 Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates. After the Emirates gained independence in 1971 oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with banks boutiques and modern highrises. At present Abu Dhabi boasts what is estimated to be the worlds highest absolute and per-capitacitation needed level of sovereign wealth funds calculated at USD 1000000 per a local national inhabitant The United Arab Emirates is located in the oil-rich and strategic Persian Gulf region. It adjoins the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman. Abu Dhabi is located in the far west and southwest part of the United Arab Emirates along the southern cost of the Persian Gulf between latitudes 22°40’ and around 25° north and longitudes 51° and around 56° east.9 The emirate borders the emirate of Dubai and Sharjah to its north. The total area of the Emirate is 67340 square kilometres occupying about 87% of the total area of the UAE excluding islands. The territorial waters of the Emirate embrace about 200 islands off its 700 kilometres coastline. The topography of the Emirate is dominated by low-lying sandy terrain dotted with sand dunes exceeding 300 metres in height in some areas southwards. The eastern part of the Emirate borders the western fringes of Al-Hajar Mountains. Hafeet Mountain Abu Dhabi’s highest elevation rising about 1300 metres is located south of Al Ain city. Good Morning! I apologize for not writing sooner. There was an immensely long plane ride and then I found tourist stuff to do and a lot of sleeping. So we arrive in Dubai I got to see the Palm from the plane. Its even on google maps. the palm is a man made palm tree looking shaped beach here in Abu Dhabi. http//www.lonelyplanet.com/united-arab-emirates/dubai/images/marina-dubai$26294-21#content My mother and I checked into the hotel around 1640 and walked around to find a grocery store. They had mostly American food items and chips. It was cool seeing Doritos and Cheez balls written in Arabic. We had dinner at this little restaurant next to the hotel called Cocos which turned out to have the entire menu of TGIFridays. Fried green beans and all. * I must mention here the dangers of crossing the streets. Everyone goes so flippin fast and even if you are at a crosswalk it is best to find one not near a round-a-bout. There is just so much chaos it is better to walk further down the street and look for a clearing using the left/right/left tactic. We went back to the hotel and crashed out. In the morning Sebatian! I went down to the beach and there were so many people in speedos! I still dont know how I feel about that. I think I still prefer men in swim trunks. Beautiful beach and they had a sand-snow-man. The next day we went on a Desert Safari- They picked us up at our hotel and we get into this van and I notice it has roll-bars installed. My first thought is oh shit they do drive crazy in Saudi turns out that the roll-bars would come in handy when we reached the desert. We were in a van with 4 other people and a driver and drove about 45 minutes away into the desert. We pull off the side of the road and go through this hold in a fence and thats when the roll bars came in handy. Im going to call it sanding but it is exactly like mudding just without the water. The driver is going crazy going over all the sand dunes and spraying sand and getting sideways on these big hills of sand! Crazy ride for sure and it was amazing. I took some video of it but I am not sure seby2 The thawb is commonly worn by men in the Arabian Peninsula Iraq and other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. It is normally made of cotton but heavier materials such as sheeps wool can also be used especially in colder climates in Iraq and Syria. The style of the thawb varies slightly among the various regions within the Persian Gulf. The sleeves and the collar can be stiffened to give a more formal appearance. Other names may be used for this garment. In Souraqia and Oman dishdasha is the most common word for the garment in the UAE the word kandura is used. In Morocco the sleeves tend to be much shorter so that the thawb may seem more like a long T-shirt and is locally called gandora. Also the neck tends to be more open than in its Saudi counterpart and is often embroidered as is the breast pocket. Also it might lack buttons altogether. The term thawb is also used to refer to similar womens garments. The traditional Palestinian womans long tunic is called thawb. Another example is a very long over-sized womans garment with a heavily embroidered front panel and billowing back also known as a Khaleeji dress which is most commonly seen in the West worn for performance of the Saudi womens social-style dances in which manipulation of the large thawb is a key component. This garment is also known as Kanzu in Swahili and is commonly worn on the Swahili Coast by Swahili men. how much you will be able to see because it is impossible to hold a camera still while you are flying down and around and over sand dunes while trying to hang on and stay in your seat. The driver pulls up to what seems like empty desert area and about 100 or more cars pull in. Here is where we meet Sebastian. Sebastian is this beautiful falcon and he has my heart because the only time I have ever been able to lucid-dream I had a falcon named Sebastian. I got to hold Sebastian and take photos and pet him. You could extend your arm and he would fluff his wings out. Definitely one of the coolest animals I have gotten to play with. Where we were stopped you could see a bunch of camels in a fence. The UAE keeps camels like we keep horses. There are a lot of similarities I just dont understand how camels can carry as much as they do. They have such tiny little legs. Falcon Video   So after the falcon we get back into the jeep and take off down the sand dunes once more to My driver photobombing me drive to the highest dunes to watch the sunset. It was very pretty but the sun did not set here like it does back home. Back home the sun literally finds the horizon and starts to cut off. First you have the full sun then slowly a straight line at the bottom the horizon works its way up to the top of the sun. In the desert the sun just gets smaller and fades. you can still see the entire circle- It is not disappearing it just .. fades. After the sunset we make our way back to where they had a camp for us. We exit the sand dunes and approach a highway where we drive on the wrong side until there was a break in the barrier - then the driver cuts through the poles holding up the street lights on the highway and gets on the correct side of the road. We go through a different gate and end up at the camels. Camels are certainly a different ride than a ride on a horse. I would have no clue how to steer these things. Thank god for the guy on the ground leading us. Jeep Sanding After the camel rides there was a camp that was just magical. You walk in and there are from view left to right A tea and coffee area a sheesha/hooka area then a bar area then shops then the buffet tables then BBQ stalls then sand boarding out the back gate and up a huge sand dune then a henna lady then a place to dress in traditional garb restrooms then circling back to the entrance with a huge stage in the middle of the camp. We walk in and grab some naan a type of bread and walk to the BBQ circle where I had the best Middle-eastern food ever. I have no idea what I was eating but if I could only eat one thing for the rest of the trip it would be the BBQ sliced off the rotating fire pit with naan bread and some salad fixings with amazing sauce. There was this amazing guy doing a dance with light up layers of clothing and when he would spin the entire suit would light up and he could manipulate the suit in crazy ways that any raver anywhere would be jealous. Ill try to get Selfis in the dessert pictures of this Im pretty sure the camera died at that point. There was also a belly dancer who had a sword on her head and did some crazy dancing. We had dinner across from this family whos boys were 4 and 6 and she was from Singapore and he was from somewhere in the UK. All four of them spoke English and the little 6 year old was fluent in Mandarin and English and would tell jokes. Cute kid. After dinner my mom and I snuck off to the little corner that had all the Hookas set up. When the man came to give us coals he asked if we knew how to smoke. Him Do you know how to smoke? Me Yes. Him Are you sure? Me. Yes. I got this.  I had previously worked at a hooka bar called Sultans in the US. I can take those things apart like none other and I am perfectly capable of dealing with coals and whatnot And that is when my mom had her first hooka. I have a feeling when I buy one she wont have to many issues with Desert sunset The city of Abu Dhabi is on the northeastern part of the Persian Gulf in the Arabian Peninsula. It is on an island less than 250 metres 820 ft from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Mussafah Bridges. A third Sheikh Zayed Bridge designed by Zaha Hadid opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to Saadiyat Island by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to Reem Island and was completed in early 2011. This is a multilayer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges of the project the largest has eight lanes four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.15 Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself but it has many suburbs on the mainland for example Khalifa City A B and C16 Al Raha Beach17 Al Bahia City A B and C Al Shahama Al Rahba Between Two Bridges Baniyas and Mussafah Residential. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi’s land surface measures 67340 square kilometres which is equivalent to about 87% of the UAE’s total land area.18 Only 30% of the emirate is inhabited with the remaining vast expanses covered mainly by desert and arid land — constituting about 93% of the total land area. Land cultivation and irrigation for agriculture and forestation over the past decade has increased the size of green areas in the emirate to about 5% of the total land area including parks and roadside plantations. About 1.2% of the total land area is used for agriculture. A small part of the land area is covered by mountains containing several caves. The coastal area contains pockets of wetland and mangrove colonies. Abu Dhabi also has dozens of islands mostly small and uninhabited some of which have been designated as sanctuaries for wildlife.19 Abu Dhabi has a hot desert climate Köppen climate classification BWh. Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above 38 °C 100 °F. During this time sandstorms occur intermittently in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.20 The cooler season is from November to March which ranges between moderately hot to warm. This period also sees dense fog on some days. On average January is the coolest month in the year while July and August are the hottest. The oasis city of Al Ain about 150 km 93 mi away bordering Oman regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country however the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year-round humidity of the capital city it because she finally knows what it is. Not to say I am going to buy one mom if you are reading this Im just saying youd be more open to it. Exhaustion has set in and I do not know what we have planned today. I know we are going to try to make it to the open markets or the souks but I am not entirely sure. We have both started our Anti-Malaria pills but we have one more uninterrupted day here in Dubai! EDIT I forgot to tell you about day 2 in Dubai! We took the metro from Abu Dhabi to Dubai and went to the souks. First we wandered around in the gold souk sadly there was nothing but this small camel that I fell in love with and then we went to the spice souks. Im fairly sure there are some pictures on here of the souks but not of the metro. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 19 Displayed 19 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Kris kristinsarah -Not all those who wander are lost- -This heart of mine was made to travel the world- -We travel not to escape life but so that life does not escape us- -Travel is the best way to Find yourself and get lost at the same time- -We travel because difference and distance are the secret tonic to creativity.

The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary or one-humped camel C. dromedarius which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa and the bactrian or two-humped camel C. bactrianus which inhabits Central Asia. Both species have been domesticated they provide milk meat hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads. The term camel is derived via Latin and Greek camelus and kamēlos respectively from Hebrew or Phoenician gāmāl which has later been transferred to a verb root meaning to bear or carry in Arabic jamala.45 The Hebrew meaning of the word gāmāl is derived from the verb root g.m.l meaning 1 stopping weaning going without or 2 repaying in kind. This refers to its ability to go without food or water as well as the increased ability of service the animal provides when being properly cared for. Camel is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae the two true camels the dromedary and bactrian and the four South American camelids the llama and alpaca are called New World camels while the guanaco and vicuña are called South American camels More camel rides Entrance to camp best food ever Sand Boarding Failed sand boarding Traditional wear I could pull off all black Mom traditional garb Henna Mom-henna Travel Blog » Middle East » United Arab Emirates » Abu Dhabi » Jebel Dhanna » Blogs » Dubai/Abu Dhabi UAE Tot 2.602s Tpl 0.029s cc 11 qc 47 dbt 0.0359s 2 msaturn wwww 104.131.125.221 sld 1  mem 1.4mb Copyright Notice All Rights Reserved Do not copy images or text from this page without requesting and receiving permission.

Today we went to Nusa Dua. Upon arrival we were expecting a line of gleaming five star hotels backing on to a pristine beach. We were dropped off near a car park some litter and some men on jet-skis shouting water spor? water spor? Oh. Luckily we werent put off and set off in search of a nicer patch of sand. It didnt take long to find the row of gleaming hotels we were expecting. I managed to sweet talk a nice Indonesian man called Davna or something into letting us have a day on the sun loungers at Oasis hotel for only 40 000 rupiah about three quid. We basked there smugly all day complete with stripy five star towels. Unfortunately lying about being the occupants of room number 603 after a margherita at The Guruh I had my eye on the pool wasnt quite so successful! One has to try. Last night we continued our film marathon with Julie and Julia. Such a funny film - I bought it for 75p if youre interested mum. Claire That pretty much sums up our day it was good to get out of Kuta and experience a southern beach. It was a lot quieter than Kuta except it had far more water sports so the engines were pretty loud but far fewer people and we liked to walk up and down the promenade taking a peek at some of the resorts. They really are beautiful. I have finally bronzed as we now like to call it which is quite exciting although with interesting tan lines it would have looked odd me coming back paler than when I left! Having experienced Kuta nightlife last week Ellie and I like to eat blog and then head back to the hotel at a very late time of 9 and watch a film... We do wake up at 7 so I think thats allowed and probably to your relief! We are definitely in holiday mode now very relaxed and just enjoying our time in Bali. I am also extremely excited about tomorrow. We leave Kuta at 11am and arrive in Labuan Bajo just after lunch. This is a fishing town that is the closest point to Komodo. Weve booked to stay there for 3 nights and Im sure it will be a great trip. Lots of diving and chasing after dragons ensues.

After hearing such great things about the Barrington Tops wilderness area we decided it was the place to work off some of our Christmas indulgences with some bush walking and camping. The 27th of December 2007 dawned bright and sunny - a welcome relief after the weeks of rain and overcast dull skies that Sydney has been suffering under. With our cat safely locked in the house with many bowls of water and with his Aunt and Uncle booked to come and visit for feeding and cuddles during our absence we packed the car and headed out of the city. The long and exhausting crawl under the harbour then north to the freeway was hard going but finally we hit the open road! The drive was fairly uneventful until we turned off the bitumen five kms south of Gloucester and headed to the Gloucester River camping area. The brave explorers then had to cross five fords over the Gloucester River which Ev loved! We met a lot of friendly locals as well.... Finally four hours after we left the city we pulled into the camp ground and after selecting a suitable spot got our tent up. The Meeting some of the locals countless signs telling us not to collect firewood in the National Park forced us to head back to the road to buy some firewood cause campings not camping without a campfire! Although a camp fires not a camp fire without marshmallows either and we forgot to pack those! As it turned out the firewood came in the form of massive logs so Ev had a chance to flex his manly muscles and do some wood chopping. Pity he hadnt packed his lumberjack shirt..... We settled in with a couple of well earned cold beers and planned our walks for the next day. Dinner was a creation involving Surprise peas and corn 2-minute noodles sultanas lamb chops vegie sausages and a LOT of curry powder!!! The real surprise was how bloody good it tasted with a glass of $5 clean skin rose to wash it down with. That night we were serenaded by a very loud froggy chorus. In the morning after a fabulous brekkie we headed to Gloucester Tops to do our walk. We settled on a 7km+ circuit of three walks taking in three completely different landscapes - the southern most population of Antarctic Beech The Gloucester Falls trees Sydney blue gum forrest and a series of stunning waterfalls that peeked beguilingly from the surrounding greenery. Dinner again involved Surprise peas and corn really the uses of dehydrated vegies are endless! and Deb. Powdered mash potato sounds so wrong but in the middle of the bush cooked with water you boiled from the river after a walk listening to crickets and frogs there is nothing better than a big pile of Deb and sausages! Dont knock it till youve tried it! All in all I would have to thoroughly recommend Barrington Tops. Such beautiful scenery and a real sense of getting away from it all. « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 7 Displayed 7 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message WAgirl LeahandEv Joined December 7th 2007 Trips 0 Last Login September 24th 2019 Followers 0 Status BLOGGER Follows 0 Blogs 32 Guestbook 56 Photos 420 Forum Posts 0 blog=231932 blogger=54216 Blog Options Top PhotosBlog Map Print Version blog=231932 blogger=54216 Advertisement Blue gum forrest Towering tree ferns How beautiful is this waterfall?

Rabbi Hachen does not know that I am doing this but I ended up with such great pictures I had to post them. Our last day had some of the worst rain of the week. Fortunately our stops were inside. Our first stop was our Tzedakah project. It was at a Jaffa Institute food warehouse in Tel Aviv where we packed packages for distribution. We did it with Harvard Princeton and Yale kids from the Birthright tour. It was nice to interact with them but I loved watching Rachel look up to them. She even asked Nina and I about her going on a Birthright trip. Nina mentioned that she was happy to see Rachel listen intently as one of the Institutes leaders a former Bronx native tell us what the Institute accomplishes on limited resources from the Israeli government. There are a lot of needy people in that section of Tel Aviv who simply cannot afford to feed their entire families. After that we traveled to the Ayalon Institute in Rehovot. This was the undedrground ammunition factory that the Hagana put into place before the War for Indpendence. It was another story of what Israelis went Sarah and Barbara Paster with Boxes at the Tzedakah Project throught to fight for a Jewish state. From hiding from the British to successfuly making the ammo for battle Israel could not have gained independence without it. Its truly an amazing story of the bullets were made in secrecy. I was impressed by the tour guide who was in his twenties. He told us that he believes that this is a story in Israels history that must always be remembered for future generations of Jews to appreciate what they have. From there our last stop was an archaeological dig at Bet Gevurin. This was a sight that was buried in 2000 years ago and we did in fact find pottery pieces from then. I could not believe how much we found in a short time. We were digging in a place that had been seven years in the making from the time digging was started above ground. Well that was our last stop and yes I am typing this after being home for a day and a half. It was a long trip but one I would recommend to anyone. The connections to the Jewish faith and heritage are too intense to be missed. I am grateful that Ammunition Equipment at the Ayalon Institute I had the opportunity to do it with my family new friends and Rabbi Hachen. We had a long flight back. We left Israel at 1140 that evening and arrived in Newark just before 5 AM on the 31st and we are all still recovering from a very active week while trying to make sure we remember everything we learned.

But first order of business I needed to get my Rav Kav card! What is it? The transportation card that allows you to use the bus/light rail system. So off I went to find the central station. I got onto bus 75 and the driver was so helpful. He told me when to get off and where to go. Into Central Station I went up to the 3rd floor and I followed the Rav Kav signs. Got my number and waited in line. Before I knew it my number was called. Even though the clerk did not speak English we were able to communicate enough that I was given my card! How cool is that? I went to a kiosk and transferred money on it then off to grab the light rail to the museum. Again people are so nice here! I asked a couple of ladies next to me about the stop I should take. They were more than helpful and not only told me what stop to get off on but pointed me into Yad Veshem the right direction. Off to the museum I went. Entrance is free but there is a small charge to get the audio headphones in your language to hear a guide walk you through all the exhibits. Words cannot describe this experience. There were times of great difficulty for me and I needed to pass through quickly. However I know that this is a place to come again and really take in those exhibits that I went by. Pictures are not allowed and I had no desire to take any. It seemed wrong to me to do so. At the end you walk out onto a terrace to view Jerusalem and the view was breath taking! I do have that picture. I then went to the Childrens Memorial. Please look it up because I simply cannot describe it...it completely shattered me and the tears were flowing. After that I needed to walk away to gather myself and just be. I walked back to the rail station and got on the next train. I decided to get off when I saw on the monitor Jaffa Square. It sounded familiar so why not? After wandering for a bit View at the end of the tour I grabbed lunch at this corner shop. I pointed to a picture of a falafel wrap and they gentleman behind the counter started putting it together. He kept asking well gesturing since he didnt speak English if I wanted this or that. I just nodded at everything! Lunch was great very filling and I couldnt finish it. Then I found my way to a bus stop jumped on the 78 and within 6 stops I was back home! Honestly I have felt more nervous on the Max at home than I have here blindly using the public transportation! After a nap and contemplation of this mornings outing Lori came to sweep me off to dinner drinks and sights to see. Meeting her has been such a great blessing! First off to the King David Hotel to have dinner and wine on the terrace. Incredible views of the old city pared with incredible food and wine. Next across the street to climb the tower at the YMCA. Seriously the most opulent YMCA I have ever been in! 360° degree views of Jerusalem. Then she whisked me away to the Waldorf Astoria for a drink and experience Lunch spot being in that beautiful lobby and bar. After that a must visit to the Notre Dame hotel and up to the 4th floor to their wine and cheese bar. There we had dessert and aperitifs. I ordered orange creme brulee with lemoncello. Yum! And again magnificent views of the old city. What memories I am gathering...along with new friends to guide me. This trip was so meant to be and without a doubt I am coming back! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 11 Displayed 11 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 5 Message Kristine B.
