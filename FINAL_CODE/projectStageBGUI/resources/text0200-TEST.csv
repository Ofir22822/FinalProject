No matter where you come from its said that everyone should make at least one trip to experience Edinburghs Hogmanay. Maybe its the fact that Edinburghs party lasts for three days instead of just one. Or perhaps its because of the sheer range of entertainment and fun on offer in a city already world-famous for its year-round selection of festivals. It could be the unique atmosphere generated by the huge crowd of welcome guests and friendly Edinburghers packed into the historic city centre. And dont forget the gasp-inducing sight of the outrageously good fireworks filling the sky with light and noise high above the turrets of Edinburgh Castle. Torchlight Procession Whatever strange chemistry it is that brings together music tradition energy history vikings and fun it seems to work with sellout crowds year after year. And yes we did say vikings! Each year the Up Helly Aa Vikings travel from Shetland by longboat probably to take their place at the head of the opening event of Edinburghs Hogmanay the Torchlight Procession. The procession takes place on 30 December and its truly a stunning sight to behold as celebrations get underway. Thousands of torch bearers march through the city’s ancient streets through the Old Town parts of which date back to at least the 14th century. They then go further downhill towards the Palace of Holyrood House. Meanwhile tens of thousands of spectators line the pavements for a spectacular finale of lights music and fireworks cheering the walkers on as they create a river of fire through from streets to Holyrood Park. And thats just the first night! Music to suit all tastes Mere hours later comes New Years Eve or Hogmanay as its better known in Scotland when the party truly reaches its peak. Stages carefully positioned throughout the city centre offer a diverse range of musical entertainment options from indie rock to traditional Celtic music and from DJs and dancers to jazz blues and more. Up in the Old Town the stunning St Giles Cathedral hosts a candlelit classical concert. Down in Princes Street Gardens theres a stage devoted entirely to the ceilidh tradition with thousands enjoying the chance to learn about and take part in wild Scottish dancing. Edinburgh Castle overlooks the celebrations from high above. Also in Princes Street Gardens is the centrepiece event of Edinburghs Hogmanay the Concert in the Gardens. Major acts such as Franz Ferdinand Rag nBone Man Biffy Clyro Lily Allen and Soul II Soul have all rocked revellers who are lucky enough to grab a ticket. New Years Eve fireworks And after all that dancing the Gardens is one of the best places to catch the magnificent fireworks bursting high above the majestic castle and its ancient volcanic rock. The illuminations can be seen for miles around of course but its quite something to find yourself immediately beneath those dramatic eruptions of light and sound at midnight and at the smaller hourly displays in the lead up to the big moment. And at midnight for all the choice of entertainment across the city centre whether you came for the big names the traditional culture the party atmosphere or the fantastic fireworks in that one moment the crowds join as one to sing the worlds biggest rendition of Auld Lang Syne in a show of togetherness and friendship. And then the bands start up again and the party carries on into the wee small hours! Swim in the River Forth But wait theres more... Edinburghs Hogmanay isnt done with you just yet. If youre feeling bold on the first day of January maybe you can shake off the rigours of the night before as one of the hardy souls taking part in the Loony Dook a street parade of costumed thrill-seekers culminating in a freezing cold plunge into the icy waters of the River Forth. If youre less keen on feeling the chill you can still cheer the Dookers on as they walk through the town of South Queensferry just a few miles west of Edinburgh and take a dip in the shadow of the famous Forth Bridge. Book your tickets For those who have felt the glare of the fiery torches who have danced to the music gasped at the fireworks sung till their voices hurt and defied the cold of the river this is one final chance to bid farewell to the year just gone and welcome the next in the company of friends old and new. There really is nothing quite like Edinburghs Hogmanay. Time to plan a trip. Edinburghs Hogmanay is part of the year round selection of major festivals in Scotlands capital city.

From its unmissable gothic cathedral to the maze of medieval streets we’ve managed to whittle down the list to just 10. If you are planning to spend a few days we recommend a York Pass which will save you money on entry to many of the citys attractions. 1. Get a gargoyle’s-eye view of York Thrusting up from York’s maze of ancient streets are the 3 muscular towers of York Minster the largest gothic building in Britain. The cathedral you see today was begun in 1220 took around 250 years to finish and is now widely considered to be one of Europe’s finest medieval buildings. Highlights here include some of the oldest and most beautiful stained-glass windows in Britain the East Window is the largest area of medieval stained glass in a single window in the world and the crypt containing some of the original 11th-century church. But it’s the heady 275-step hike to the top of the Central Tower that’s the real show-stopper here. Catch your breath and take in the gargoyle’s-eye view of Yorkshire spread out below just as breathless visitors have done for the last 600 years. 2. Go back in time at a Victorian prison If you’ve ever wondered what life might have been like 200 years ago York Castle Museum can enlighten you. Experience the sights and sounds of 18th-century York on a wonderfully recreated Victorian street before exploring the museum’s other social history exhibits covering topics from World War I to 1960s pop culture. The museum is housed in a former prison but gets its name from the fact it stands on the site of a castle built by William the Conqueror. Located in central York entry is free with a York Pass. 3. Go trainspotting The awesome scale slick lines and steam-powered appeal of the locomotives housed at the National Railway Museum are enough to turn even the coolest observer into a fervent trainspotter. The vast treasures in the cavernous halls include the only Bullet Train outside Japan Queen Victoria’s ‘palace on wheels’ and the achingly beautiful Duchess of Hamilton a 1930s art deco triumph of design and engineering. Open every day entry is free. 4. Visit one of the world’s greatest mansions Named One of the Worlds Top Ten Greatest Mansions and Grand Houses by Lonely Planet Castle Howard is definitely worth the short bus journey from York city. Like stumbling on to the set of a period drama the magnificent 18th-century mansion set amid lush gardens and rolling hills has been the backdrop to many a film and costumed TV show. There’s much to explore here along with its movie-star past after marvelling at the dramatic interiors and world-renowned art collection you can wander the acres of parkland dotted with lakes and temples leaving time for tea and cake in the quaint café. Entry is free with a York Pass. 5. See hear and smell a Viking settlement Buckle up for a rollicking journey back through time to the days when raiders from the north had colonised 10th-century York. See hear and even smell a Viking settlement complete with blacksmith bedrooms and a historically accurate Viking toilet. Jorvik Viking Centre is a fine mix of history and fun that brings some of the astonishingly well-preserved objects excavated from beneath the city to life. If you fancy a more hands-on approach to history don’t miss DIG the attraction that lets you play archaeologist. 6. Enjoy a traditional high tea Youve climbed the central tower of York Minster you’ve been wowed by the steam behemoths at the National Railway Museum and you may even have seen a genuine Viking lavatory. So by now youve probably earned a cup of tea. And the place to have it has to be Betty Tea Rooms a Yorkshire institution serving delicious pastries cakes and restorative tea in gorgeous surroundings unchanged since the 1930s. Decked out by the same craftsmen who fitted out the Queen Mary ocean liner a cup of tea here is a luxurious experience not to be missed. 7. Taste your way through chocolate history One of York’s newer attractions is also its sweetest. Chocolate has been made in the city for 300 years and York was once home to 2 of the world’s big chocolate brands – Rowntree’s and Terry’s. Iconic chocs from Aero to Smarties and the mighty Kit Kat began life here so it’s a fine place to learn about the chocolate-making process from bean to bar. At Chocolate – Yorks Sweet Story youll taste your way through chocolate history discover generations of confectionery secrets and end your tour in the Chocolate Bar to enjoy such extravagances as an All Day Chocolate Breakfast and an Ultimate Chocolate Fondue. 8. Ramble down The Shambles Lying at the heart of a warren of old twisting lanes is The Shambles one of the best preserved medieval streets in Europe. Its origins are so old it was once mentioned in the Doomsday Book while the overhanging timber-framed houses that still stand today are a remarkable reminder of the city’s past. Now the picturesque buildings are filled with quaint cafes and shops selling everything from sweets to handmade soaps. 9. Hear terrifying tales of Roman York Like a good fright? At the York Dungeon expect to jump with fear and be reduced to laughter as you hear terrifying tales of the city’s gruesome past. With York’s history of Viking invasions witches and the plague there’s many gory legends to tell and you’ll meet some of the area’s most despicable characters as you are led through a series of scenes in the immersive live action show. 10. Walk England’s best medieval walls Our favourite free thing to do in York. Circling the city centre York’s medieval walls are the most complete in the whole of England. You’ll get fantastic views over the picturesque River Ouse and the city itself so don’t forget to bring your camera. Getting there York is in the north of England in the county of Yorkshire. It’s about 2 hours by train from London or only 1 hour 15 minutes from Manchester. Find out more about the city of York.

Moravian Slovakia is a region where folk traditions and folklore are an integral part of life. In this diverse region of colours and flavours you can immerse yourself in a swirl of dancing parades and festivals that are hundreds of years old which people manage to live to the full to this very day. A special place among these is held by the men’s dance Verbuňk which has even found its way onto the UNESCO list thanks to its unique nature.

It was originally the way recruits said goodbye when they were leaving to join the army to prove that they were prepared for the demanding military service and also to impress the girls. A peculiarity of Verbuňk is that the dancers are not bound by any fixed choreography. This means that each dancer can choose to interpret it any way he chooses. It is said that you cannot learn Verbuňk but that boys from Moravian Slovakia are born with Verbuňk in their blood. Allow yourself to be carried away in a whirl of colours and rhythms When dancing the Verbuňk the dancer is also a singer. Sung and danced verses alternate and the number of dance moves performed also increases as the dance speeds up. These include skips jumps knee bends twirls and hand claps. Verbuňk has become an integral part of various festivities. Men dance it at every opportunity when there is any feasting grape harvest or even regular dances. Allow yourself to be carried away by the energy of the dancers which you will not experience anywhere else. Set out for Moravian Slovakia !

The Trolls Tongue is an epic sight but its a tough hike of 23km or 10 hours return from the trailhead at Skjeggedal 13km northeast of Odda. Tickets & tours Trolltunga Overnight Hike £328.22 and up Details More tickets & tours The hike is usually doable from late May to early September depending on snowfall. The trail is well marked from the car park with distance markers along the route outlining the distance left to the summit – but the ascent is brutal in places covering a total climb of about 1000m so make 100% sure youre in adequate shape and have the proper gear before you decide to tackle it. En route watch out for the Tyssestrengene waterfall 646m. If you want to tackle the walk earlier in the season or youd just prefer to hike with a pro Trolltunga Active offers guided hikes. You definitely wont be alone at the top – Trolltunga is one of Norways most Instagrammed sights – but standing on the rock and staring out into thin air is worth every step to the top. If you continue on a little beyond Trolltunga you reach another fine vantage point you reach Preikestolen Pulpit Rock a smaller version of the much more famous lookout of the same name overlooking Lysefjord near Stavanger. In July and August Tide www.tide.no runs an express coach once a day between Tyssedal and the real Preikestolen car park near Stavanger allowing you to summit both of Norways most famous climbs in just a couple of days.

The population of the town is only 1000 people but the town revives in summer due to the multiple tourists who choose Kiten for their summer vacation. The average temperature in July is 23-24° С and one of the advantages of the town is the unique combination of sea and mountains Strandzha. The other advantages are the two wonderful bays – Karaagach and Atliman and the wide seashores. The northern beach also known as Atliman is located at the end of the bay and is covered in beautiful sand dunes. The southern bay Urdoviza is divided into two beaches – Kiten South and Camping Kiten. In ancient times there used to be a settlement located at the same place where Kiten now lies – its fortress walls were preserved to the present day and have been restored. Today’s settlement was founded in 1932. The name Kiten was given because the town looks like a bunch of flowers kitka in Bulgarian when viewed from a distance. During archaeological studies of the southern bay many findings were discovered such as stone tools bone tools and pottery which can be seen in the museum of Sozopol. A legend tells the story of Stana Urdovizka – a girl who was famous for her beauty she lived in the Urdoviza fortress in the first years of the Ottoman Dominion of Bulgaria. She was so beautiful that the Ottoman sultan captivated by her beauty proposed to her to marry him. The girl agreed – but in one condition – that the Sultan exempts of all taxes the Bulgarian lands which a rider on a ‘flying’ horse can cover from sunrise to sunset. The sultan agreed. One morning the girl left with her horse and roamed the forests and ravines all day. At dusk when she almost toured the whole Strandzha mountain she rode towards the black seashore. When she reached the bay her horse collapsed dead the beautiful girl of Urdoviz died of fatigue too. The local population was exempted of taxes and the location was called Atliman Bay Horse bay. Nowadays Kiten is a nice resort where everyone can find their way into the many private hotels guest houses holiday stations and campsites. The unique combination of mountains and sea the wide beaches with various attractions fishing opportunities etc. offer an unforgettable holiday. The dining and the recreational centers are numerous and diverse – restaurants pizzerias taverns bars and discos. The resort proximity to Primorsko increases the accommodation and recreation options. The Ropotamo reserve is located in the vicinity. Attractive boat trips are offered at the Ropotamo river. Nobody gets bored at the beaches of Kiten and Primorsko – here you can surf hire a jet dive play beach volleyball or practice other sports or just tan and relax. The river flowing into the sea near Kiten – Karaagach – is rich in fish and is a favorite spot for the fishermen staying at the resort.

Completed in 1936 after eight years of labour the Trolls Ladder is a stunning feat of road building spiralling up the mountainside through 11 hairpin bends and a 112 gradient and after heavy rain waterfalls cascade down the mountainside drenching cars as they pass. To add to the thrill much of it is effectively single-lane meaning traffic jams and passing vehicles are part of the hair-raising experience.

The UKs Guardian newspaper once crowned it the worlds best road trip. For a highway that is barely 8km long the weight of expectation may be too great but its certainly hugely scenic. During the autumn storms youll experience natures wrath at its most dramatic. In season look out for whales and seals offshore. Details Visit website You can do the road in either direction from Molde hit the coast at Bud from Kristiansund and the north take the new undersea road tunnel that connects with Bremsnes. Whichever your direction rather than driving the Rv64 which cuts across inland Averøya choose the quieter prettier road signed for Kvernes which loops around the islands southern coast and takes no longer. Several scenic overlooks are stationed along the route with striking structures built as part of the Nasjonaleturistvegen project which aims to promote 18 of Norways scenic roads and enhance them with cutting-edge architecture. Key stops include the rest area and walking path at Eldhusøya an island off the southwest of Averøya and the glass-fronted viewing platform at Askevågen a little over 10km north of Bud which gives you a 360-degree panoramic view of the archipelago the ocean and the shore. The most impressive – and longest – bridge is Storseisund a gravity-defying marvel that seems to curl and twist on its way from Eide to Averøy island. Its starred in umpteen car advertisements. You dont necessarily need your own car to follow the road although it does make it a lot more fun. Eide Auto buses link Molde and Kristiansund year-round. There are five daily buses from Monday to Friday two on Saturday and one on Sunday. Its a 2¼ hour return trip although if you buy the day ticket you can hop on and off at will.

Its ancient town stands on Argolian land overlooking the Saronic Gulf. The mountain heights of Arachnaio Koryfaio and Tithio form a natural perimeter which embraces the town protecting from the winds and giving it an exceptionally mild climate. Clear running waters beautiful natural landscapes and beneficial climatic conditions served to create the ideal place for healing of man with the power of the gods. The Asklepieion at Epidaurus gained fame throughout the world for its unique healing practices as it was undoubtedly the greatest of the theurgical sites in antiquity. It is said that more than 200 healing centres worked under Asklepieion’s authorization throughout the Eastern Mediterranean area. Today its monuments apart from being recognised as masterpieces of ancient Greek art they are also standing proof of the practice of medicine in antiquity. They illustrate the medical evolution from the time where it was believed that healing depended on God to the time where it developed into science based on a systematic knowledge through accumulative experience. Change through the course of time Asklepios’ worshiping son of Apollo and Koronis granddaughter of King Malos of Epidaurus was established in the sixth century BC. Asklepios protector of human health and personal happiness was a very popular deity with an ever-increasing number of worshippers. The Sanctuary at Kynortion was quickly overwhelmed by a great number of visitors so a new sanctuary was founded in the plain approximately 1 km northwest of Kynortion Hill on the site where according to the myth Asklepios was born. The two sanctuaries one dedicated to Apollo Maleatas and the other to Asklepios were subsequently known under the common name of Sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas and Asklepios. During the fourth and third centuries BC buildings were erected in both the mountain and plain sanctuaries the Classical temple the altar of Apollo the Great Stoa the priests residence and the Temenos of the Muses in the former the Temple of Asklepios the Abaton the Tholos the Theatre the Stadium the Banqueting Hall and the hostel in the latter. The Asklepion flourished again in Imperial times and particularly in the second half of the second century AD when the Roman consul Antonine financed the refurbishment of old buildings and the construction of new ones. During this period Pausanias visited admired and described in detail the sanctuary and its monuments. Excavations began in 1881 under the guidance of Panagiotis Kavvadias who devoted his entire life to his beloved Epidaurus. The Sanctuary of Asklepios at Epidaurus was added to the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in 1988. Epidaurus Asklepion - Holistic health care Archaeological evidence give us proof that Asklepieia offered in antiquity what we nowadays call holistic health care. The therapies and treatments practiced by the mystic-physicians were extremely sophisticated. Centuries of observation of nature the human body and the interdependence of mental harmony and physical health created a complex medical context for healing which proved extremely effective. On the site of the imposing Asklepieion the existence of an even older sanctuary and healing centre has been confirmed which was dedicated to a female fertility goddess. Later Apollo was worshipped on the same site also as a god of healing until Asklepios who was thought to have been born in Epidaurus took over divine responsibility for medical care. Over the years the accumulated experience of the priests together with the effective synergy of the incomparable climate and natural surroundings of the land of Argolis led to highly successful medical treatments. This resulted in a veritable swarm of visitors seeking treatment not only from within Greece but also from countries far away. Therapeutic treatment of the spirit body and soul Each activity which took place at Epidaurus was designed to harmonize the mind body and soul. The theatre of Epidaurus this miraculous shell-like structure with its amazing acoustics and harmonious architecture was a place where visitors could attend performances and escape from their small debilitating everyday problems. Music theatre and the reading of philosophical texts prepared the soul to achieve the ultimate healing of the body. The patient after the necessary cleansings and having reached a calm and mentally relaxed state was led to the main therapeutic area the Abaton. This was a mysterious dome shaped structure with mystagogical corridors and complex circular mazes. The architecture of Asklepieion is still remarkable today. The building was circular referencing the safety and security of the maternal embrace. The layout of the sanctuary served to focus the concentration of the patient and draw strength from his inner world. This preparatory stage was followed by the main healing phase known as enkoimesis a gentle non-invasive method which nevertheless proved very effective. During sleep the person allowed himself to dream of the god who would visit him in the inner sanctuary offering the healing treatment that was needed. The mystic followers of Asklepios guided the dream experience with appropriate interventions in order to create the best outcome for the patient. In 1883 70 inscriptions providing epigraphic evidence were found - the so-called iamata or remedies which indicate many successful treatments for a wide range of ailments. The Sanctuary of Asklepios at Epidaurus its peaceful natural surroundings influenced by its primitive and mysterious place in history invites us to explore the forces of nature and those within ourselves. connect and experience Download Banners Download Wallpapers Download Guides Download Brochures Download Maps Download Photos Sign up to our newsletter explore Greece by interest Culture Leisure Touring Gastronomy Activities Religious Meetings City Break useful info Sea Routes A.I.A.

In the heart of Rhodes in the medieval city a haunting and mysterious air wafts through the streets summoned back to life through the centuries. The famous Order of the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem the Hospitallers has left an indelible mark on the island. If one walks around the always lively town one can almost hear the hoofbeats of the horses and the whispering voices of history. The town was never deserted or abandoned. It is one of the rare survivors of the medieval world it stands unscathed in all its vibrant beauty. In 1988 UNESCO declared the architectural complex of the Knights of Rhodes to be World Heritage Site. The feeling of exploring the medieval streets of Rhodes is difficult to put into words. Time seems to have stopped in the middle ages and the atmosphere is shrouded in the haze of its knightly past. The cobbled streets and Gothic towers challenge the traveller to unlock their deepest secrets. The eternal centre In 1309 after many great adventures the military order of fighting monks from Jerusalem the legendary Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem arrived on Rhodes. The Order established itself in the Byzantine city which was built around the ancient Acropolis. Like a spiral in space and time the castle city evolved around its ancient core. The ancient city north of the island was built in 408 BC following a perfect Hippodamian system of town planning. In the 7th century AD the Byzantines fortified a small part of the original town for reasons of safety. Later the walls were extended to encompass an area of 175000 square metres. With the arrival of the Knights of Saint John Rhodes quickly became the great centre of their kingdom. The Order came to occupy an influential position in the eastern Mediterranean and simultaneously enjoyed great glory wealth and reputation. From the heart of the Mediterranean they were able to put up strong resistance to repeated Turkish attacks. The great commercial port and the city which came to occupy an area of 800000 square metres stood impregnable for two centuries. A treaty with Suleiman the Magnificent in 1522 after a six month siege marked the departure of the Knights who sailed for Malta leaving behind them a true architectural gem. The architecture of power In medieval times the town of Rhodes was divided by an internal wall in two sectors. The northern quarter known as the Chateau” Castrum” or Castellum” was where the administrative buildings the hospital the cathedral and the residences of the Knights and the Grand Master were to be found. The houses of the laity the street market synagogues and churches were gathered in the southern quarter the so-called Ville” Burgus” or Burgum”. The monuments of knightly Rhodes exude the strength and knowledge of the great guilds of the Middle Ages. The buildings of the Knights are built in Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles interspersed with Byzantine architectural features and later Ottoman influences. The overall effect is truly captivating. The many great churches in the medieval city are very interesting. Some of them were later used as mosques. The churches of Agia Triada the Holy Trinity Agios Athanasios St. Athanasius Agia Aikaterini St. Catherine the church of Panagia tou Kastrou the Virgin of the Castle and Agia Paraskevi are all excellent examples of sacred architecture. The palace of the Grand Master of the Order the famous Castello” is one of the greatest monuments erected in the Middle Ages. It was the administrative centre the residence of leader of the Knights of St John of Rhodes and the seat of the established ruling class. During the Ottoman period it was seriously damaged by an ammunition explosion. It was rebuilt during the time when Rhodes was under Italian occupation in 1912. Today it houses the Museum of Rhodes and has an extensive array of exhibits. Visitors are able to admire not only the palace itself but also the impressive collections of tombstones paintings statuary jewellery books and mosaics. Here are also some of the most important archaeological findings of the ancient history of the eastern Mediterranean such as the Trophy of Mithridatic Wars the statue of Laokoon and the mosaic of the enigmatic Medusa. The Knights’ Hospital a unique gothic masterpiece now houses the Archaeological Museum with a great many artefacts from the long history of the island. The Museum of Modern Greek Art is housed in three historic buildings.

For years travel to Kaliningrad could be a challenge. Inspiration Now that Russia has introduced a simplified electronic-visa process Kaliningrad is easier than ever for tourists to visit. Note that the United States Canada and the U.K. are not expected to benefit from the e-visa program citizens of those countries will still need to file for a standard tourist visa. With improved access and a fascinating history influenced by an array of cultures and conflict it’s no surprise that Kaliningrad the largest city in the region of the same name has been named the Travelers’ Choice #1 Emerging Destination in the world. Once you learn about Kaliningrad it’s not hard to see why travelers are jumping at the chance to visit. Getting to Know Kaliningrad Culturally Prussian until the end of World War II Kaliningrad was annexed by the former Soviet Union and remains a Russian territory today making it a unique fusion of Prussian Russian and German cultures. Soviet-era buildings and monuments share the stage with Gothic-style cathedrals and the legacy of Age of Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. Things to See in Kaliningrad For centuries Kaliningrad was known as Königsberg an East Prussian city founded by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. The restored 14th-century Königsberg Cathedral is a key attraction of the modern capital boasting a gorgeous organ frequently used for short midday concerts that visitors can enjoy. One traveler dubbed it the most German-looking building in the city” thanks to its Brick Gothic construction. Today the church boasts two chapels — one Lutheran the other Russian Orthodox — as well as the tomb of Kant the so-called Sage of Königsberg. Don’t miss the 19th-century King’s Gate formerly an important part of the city’s defensive walls. Today the gate is also home to a museum dedicated to the development of the fortified city. The late-19th-century Fort XI Dönhoff was one of 12 forts forming the city’s outer fortification ring because it evaded a full-on attack during World War II it remains impressively well-preserved. One reviewer called their visit to the fort the best experience I had in Kaliningrad” thanks in large part to the knowledgeable and helpful staff. Discover typical life in prewar Kaliningrad at Altes Haus a private museum in a former home dating to 1912. Here it is as though time stopped in the early 20th century with furnishings and objects evoking local Prussian history and culture. Not only does the museum boast tons of interesting information but unlike at other museums visitors can touch and handle the objects. Visitors to Kaliningrad should also tour the Bunker Museum which delves into one of the most transformative periods in the city’s history. Located within a former German bomb shelter the museum’s displays chronicle the final battle for the city in early 1945. Finally be sure to visit the former fishing village area of the city with its charming restaurants and architecture.

Be sure to stop by the Amber Museum which houses about 14000 individual amber pieces including the second-largest in the world.

Neuschwanstein is known all over the world as a symbol of idealised romantic architecture and for the tragic story of its owner. After losing sovereignty in his own kingdom Ludwig II withdrew into his own world of myths legend and fairytales. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Neuschwanstein Castle in southern Bavaria is without doubt one of the most frequently photographed sights in Germany. Ludwig IIs ambitious project begun in 1869 united aspects of Wartburg Castle with those attributed to the Castle of the Holy Grail from Wagners Parsifal. For Ludwig Neuschwanstein was primarily a retreat. After ascending the Bavarian throne in 1864 he was forced to cede power to the Prussians just two years later which left him with a hatred of the royal seat of Munich. To compensate he devoted more and more of his time to the fine arts. After his sovereignty was taken away he withdrew into his own world of myths legend and fairytales. Among the castles finest rooms are two magnificent halls. One of these the Singers Hall is a larger and more exquisite version of the same room in the Wartburg and also incorporates elements from the medieval castles banqueting hall – though it never echoed to the sound of singing or festivities. The double-storey throne room reaches fifteen metres in height and is encircled by galleries on both floors. Its extravagant decorations dazzle in gold and blue. Ludwigs great passion however was for the Hall of the Holy Grail in which he united his nostalgia for the Middle Ages with the latest technology of the time. The king even chose to wallow in the Middle Ages at mealtimes – his dining room is a veritable shrine to the minnesingers contest at Wartburg Castle. Ludwigs sleeping quarters show a clear Gothic influence and are even embellished with details referencing Wagners operas. The dressing table has a swan-shaped tap inspired by Lohengrin. Another well-known feature of Neuschwanstein is the grotto whose little waterfalls and coloured lighting create the impression of a mysterious cave. Excursions to neo-Gothic Hohenschwangau Castle which was rebuilt from 12th century ruins in 1832 and to the Roman bath at Mount Tegelberg are also recommended. read more » « less Discover more in the local region Isar Cycle Route - River meadows and Alpine peaks » At the heart of the Allgäu and brimming with history Kempten » Linderhof Palace – Ludwig IIs highest flight of fancy. » Swabian Spa Route – Just get away from the everyday stress! » www.neuschwanstein.de Copyrights Home Towns cities & culture Palaces parks & gardens Famous figures Fairytale refuges for the fairytale king Neuschwanstein Castle top of page Search at germany.travel Save route Share/forward route Print route Delete route Create new route My routes 0 View in Google route planner Unnamed route 0 DestinationsLength of route 0 kmDuration 0 Means of transport The route cannot be calculated.

The cathedral is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Mary rather than the Three Kings whose relics were transferred to Cologne from Milan in the 12th century and have since been kept in a golden shrine that made the cathedral an important pilgrimage site.

Other attractions include the stained glass windows carved choir stalls and 14th century paintings. A number of cultural events are held in and around the cathedral including the organ recitals that take place every Tuesday in summer and the choir performances held once a month from September to June in front of the shrine housing the relics of the Three Kings.

Nowhere else will you find such a wealth of original buildings dating from the Middle Ages. You cant help but ask yourself whether time has stood still as you amble past the beautiful old houses secluded squares and tucked-away corners of the old quarter where towers taverns and town gates alternate with fountains fortifications and former storehouses. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner But it could all have been so different ... in 1631 during the Thirty Years War Rothenburg was captured by General Tilly of the Catholic forces. In desperation the councillors offered him wine in a tankard that could hold more than three litres. Tilly who had intended to burn down the town showed clemency and decreed that he would spare Rothenburg if anyone could empty the vessel in one steady chug. The former mayor came forward and to everyones astonishment met the challenge. Tilly was suitably impressed and let the town stand. Whether all of this is true nobody really knows but its undoubtedly a great story – and it also gives rise to the annual Meistertrunk festival a historical spectacle with a focus on entertainment. Germanys most beautiful road and Christmas all year round Rothenburg may be small but it has a remarkable wealth of historical sights museums churches abbeys and monuments. Be sure to allow plenty of time for your visit. From Rothenburg you can explore the Romantic Road  Germanys most famous and most beautiful scenic route. You can either travel towards Füssen and the Alps or towards Würzburg to the river Main. This is the Germany of fairytale fame with majestic castles magnificent scenery and culinary delights fit for a king – the Romantic Road offers a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Back in Rothenburg another nostalgic spot is the Käthe Wohlfahrt Christmas Village. The largest Christmas shop in Europe open all year round it stocks everything that makes the festive season special from candles nutcrackers and decorative tablecloths to Germanys famous Christmas pyramids and incense burner figures. Old quarters beautiful churches and cosy inns It is well worth strolling through Rothenburgs spital quarter passing through the medieval town gates or visiting the wonderful churches. St. James Church for example has a beautiful stone carving depicting Christ and the sleeping apostles. Also special is the beautifully decorated Church of St. Wolfgang at the Klingentor gate dedicated to the patron saint of shepherds. But it doesnt really matter where you go in Rothenburg new and wonderful sights arrive at every turn. And whichever you choose to visit there is always a cosy inn waiting afterwards in which you can sate your hunger and quench your thirst. read more » « less Related topics Traditions and customs Gemütlichkeit Christmas Discover more in the local region Experience the amazing world of the PLAYMOBIL FunPark! » Frontiers of the Roman Empire Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes » Weikersheim Palace.

And since Dresden also just happens to be set amidst a stunning river landscape your amazement is soon accompanied by pure delight. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner Though the attribute world famous is dished out all too readily it is a befitting term in the case of Dresden. The city is famed not only for its three major landmarks – Zwinger Palace Semper Opera House and the Church of Our Lady – but also for Brühl Terrace and the Royal Palace for the Elbe palaces on the Loschwitz hillside for the exclusive villas of Blasewitz the garden city of Hellerau and of course for the twelve Dresden State Art Collections. And not forgetting the city centres prime position on the western bank of the Elbe at the apex of one of the rivers gently sweeping meanders. Dresdens no. 1 world-famous building has to be Zwinger Palace widely considered a masterpiece of baroque architecture. The glorious Church of Our Lady resurrected from the rubble is arguably the preeminent church of the Protestant faith and the imposing Saxony State Opera House designed in the Italianate High Renaissance style by its eponymous architect Semper is undoubtedly one of the worlds most beautiful music theatres. The gardens of Brühl Terrace or the Balcony of Europe as it is known provide magnificent views of the Elbe and across to Neustadt on the bank opposite lined with prestigious buildings including the Academy of Fine Arts and the Albertinum Museum with its New Masters Gallery and sculpture collection the terrace is another of the citys cultural must-sees. Dresden boasts superb museums that add to its cultural prowess including the Green Vault – the worlds largest treasure chamber – at the Royal Palace as well as the Turkish Chamber and the Old Masters Gallery where Raphaels Sistine Madonna is displayed. For almost 700 years Dresden has also been famed for its music. It is not only the Opera House that enraptures audiences but also the State Orchestra the Dresden Philharmonic and the Kreuzchor boys choir. The cultural calendar is packed all year round with the city hosting international festivals captivating theatre and dance productions and other popular events such as the Semper Opera Ball. And what would Dresdens music scene be without its jazz? The citys International Dixieland Festival is Europes biggest old time jazz festival. Traditional highlights include the Riverboat Shuffle the Jazz Mile along Prager Strasse and the Dixieland Parade through the old quarter. The festival season is rounded off with open-air events including the riverbank film nights the Elbhangfest and concerts in the romantic parkland of the Elbe palaces. But Dresden is more than just a city of history and heritage as evidenced by its modern architectural masterpieces. Notable examples include the New Synagogue and the deconstructivist UFA Kristallpalast cinema designed by celebrated Austrian architects Coop Himmelblau.

Todays visitors will be equally impressed whether they look round the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in the Semper wing of Zwinger Palace or the separate Galerie Neue Meister at the Albertinum on Brühl Terrace a gallery that was established in 1965. Here you begin to understand what the terms master and masterly truly mean. They are synonymous with outstanding works from the Italian Renaissance and Baroque – most notably Raphaels Sistine Madonna– as well as the legacy of geniuses such as Titian Canaletto Botticelli Veronese and Tintoretto. Masterly are the Flemish and Dutch paintings of the 17th century – Rubens Rembrandt Van Dyck and Vermeer – and works by Spanish French and German painters including Dürer Cranach and Holbein. The quality of the collection and the magnificent Semper building are what make the Old Masters Gallery so special. The New Masters Gallery pays tribute to the most influential German artists of the Romantic era including Caspar David Friedrich and spans the period right up to the present day. Impressionists such as Claude Monet Edgar Degas Max Liebermann Max Slevogt and Expressionists such as Otto Dix Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff take visitors on a tour of modern art history right up to the time of Gerhard Richter Sigmar Polke and Georg Baselitz.

For over 250 years this masterpiece created by the citys master carpenter and architect George Bähr has reflected the prosperity and faith of Dresdens citizens. Built between 1726 and 1743 the badly damaged church became a war memorial after 1945 and is now a symbol of reconciliation. Its re-consecration was broadcast live to the world in 2005 and a series of prestigious concerts church services and free sightseeing visits are currently giving visitors the chance to marvel at its glory.

Today’s Vergina Ancient Aigai in the foothills of Mt. Pieria was the first capital of ancient kingdom of Macedonia called Aigai. The site of the Royal Tombs under a modern roof hosts the main excavation as well as an exhibition of the major finds from the burials. It is protected by UNESCO as world cultural heritage and comprises a unique discovery of an enormous universal impact. In the same area inhabited continuously since the 3rd millennium BC are also the ruins of an acropolis palace theater shrines and private buildings and hundreds of common graves of an extensive necropolis of the ancient city of Aigai until Roman times. The exhibition’s shelter has the external form of the Great Tumulus a man-made mound while the underground building has been housing since November 1997 tombs and treasures found in them. This sheltered group includes three Macedonian tombs the intact tomb of Philip II II with a hunting scene fresco painting. Intact is also the so-called Tomb of the Prince III which may belong to Alexander IV grandson of Philip II and his son Alexander the Great and another ruined and plundered Macedonian tomb IV of the third BC century. The visitor will also see a plundered a cist family tomb I known as the Tomb of Persephone” with the incomparable fresco of the abduction of Persephone by Hades and a ruined building named Heroon probably used for the worship of the dead royal members buried next door. Some of the major finds exhibited here are the two golden urns containing the bones of Philip II and one of his wives two oak and one myrtle golden wreaths worn by the royal dead. On display is also the rare gold-and-purple embroidered cloth which wrapped the bones of the royal wife along with her golden diadem of a unique art two ivory symposium beds weapons and armor of Philip II valuable symposium utensils of the royal family and the silver urn of Prince. The awe and anguish of man before death the gateway to another dimension of the dead to Hades the splendor of the royal glory the emotion that creates the tragic end of the royal house of Temenids are ideas inherent in the atmosphere of the Royal Tombs of Aigai exhibited in a dark neutral place dominated only by the brightly lit treasures and tombs.

5eae9dac2dae09d3a6b6b171,https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/some-of-europes-best-skiing-is-in-tiny-andorra/,Menu  item.label  Follow Us Go to Tripadvisor My Profile Page Tripadvisor on the Go Go to Tripadvisor Inspiration Stories Tips Travel Guides Go to Tripadvisor Inspiration Some of Europe’s Best Skiing Is in Tiny Andorra By Siddhi Camila Lama Just a quick hop away from Barcelonas beaches youll find some of the finest ski resorts in Europe. Inspiration Tips Barcelona is well-known for its sun and beaches. Even in winter when temperatures hover around the mid-40s it’s practically balmy. With so much sun in this coastal city visitors often get lucky and can hang out on the beach year-round. Given the weather you may be surprised to discover that Barcelona provides access to some of the best and most affordable skiing in Europe. Just two hours away from the city are various ski resorts in the Pyrenees of Andorra. Visiting Andorra Andorra Andorra is a tiny independent principality that’s nestled between the French and Spanish Pyrenees mountains. If you haven’t heard of it you aren’t alone — it’s the sixth smallest nation in Europe. Andorra is primarily accessible by bus and car. Public transport routes are frequent from Barcelona. Other Catalonian cities including Girona Reus and Lleida also provide easy access to Andorra’s resorts. Alternatively if you’re visiting from France coaches and shuttle buses leave from Toulouse Carcassonne and Perpignan. Those renting a car and driving to Andorra should be sure to travel with snow socks or chains as storms can come in quickly often stranding vehicles until the roads are cleared. If you don’t want to rent a car long-distance car-sharing apps like BlaBlaCar are also popular. Skiing in Andorra Andorra has three main ski resorts Grandvalira Pal Arinsal and Ordino Arcalís. Ordino Arcalís and Pal Arinsal which are neighboring resorts in the Valls del Nord region of Andorra both sell their own ski passes. The Grandvalira ski area is located in eastern Andorra. As of 2019 each lift pass to Grandvalira also grants free entry to the Ordino Arcalís resort. Entering Andorra from Spain vs. France Given Andorra’s location most of its towns provide access to ski resorts. However keep in mind that the Spanish and French routes enter from different sides of the country. From the Spanish side you’re likely to come in through Andorra la Vella Andorra’s capital. The capital provides access to all three of Andorra’s ski resorts. If you enter from France you’ll usually come in through Pas de la Casa at the eastern end of the Grandvalira resort area. Staying here and skiing in the Valls del Nord area isn’t possible without a car. Ordino Arcalís Ordino Arcalis 82 Reviews Ordino Arcalís has one of the longest ski seasons in Europe running from mid-November to the first week of May. This Andorran resort is known for having some of the best off-piste skiing in Andorra. It also offers snowshoe excursions ski biking snowmobiling ski mountaineering ski paragliding and heliskiing. There are even excursions that will take you up the mountain at night to sleep under the stars. Be aware that Ordino Arcalís is a fairly small ski resort Slope length is just 18 miles with 16 lifts and 28 runs. But if you are comfortable with off-piste runs this is an especially great place to experience. Most people who choose to visit this area stay in Andorra la Vella or nearby. From there you can take a bus to and from the lifts. Ordino Arcalís’ distance from most towns means that it’s much more relaxed compared to other resorts and has limited après-ski culture. However you’ll still find six different restaurant-bars on the mountain where you can take in the views and relax. Most nightlife will be around Andorra la Vella or in the nearby resort of Arinsal. Pal Arinsal Vallnord Pal-Arinsal 859 Reviews Pal Arinsal is about twice the size of Ordino Arcalís. It has a ski area of 39 miles with 29 mechanical lifts and 52 ski runs. Pal Arinsal is known as a family-friendly ski resort that’s best suited to beginner and intermediate skiers. In addition to skiing it also offers snowshoe excursions snow mountaineering snow triking a ropes course zip lining and panoramic helicopter flights. Après-ski is much more lively in this part of the Valls del Nord area. You’ll find various restaurants bars and live music venues to keep you occupied in both the Arinsal and La Massana villages. Additionally certain restaurants on the runs offer moonlit dinners on weekends. Although there is a lot going on here keep in mind that this resort is still fairly small. Don’t expect the extensive après-ski or nightlife that can be found in larger resorts. Grandvalira Grandvalira 1728 Reviews Grandvalira is consistently heralded as the best resort in Andorra with an expansive ski area of 130 miles. This ski area has a total of 75 lifts that lead to 139 ski runs as well as a vast array of off-piste opportunities. It also offers snowmobiling dog sledding snowshoe treks snow tubing zip lining and various snow parks for freestylers. As the largest of the Andorran resorts the Grandvalira area has a number of places to stay. The most convenient hotels are in Pas de la Casa Grau Roig Soldeu El Tarter Canillo and Encamp where the main lifts are. Hotels in these areas will provide you with access to the widest variety of restaurants and après-ski options. Pas de la Casa is the most happening location providing easy access to a multitude of restaurants bars and clubs. It even hosts an annual electronic music festival the Hibernation Festival toward the end of the season. Visitors who prefer a more traditional après-ski experience often favor Soldeu a smaller town with excellent restaurants bars and spas. Keep in mind that admission to Grandvalira automatically includes access to the Ordino Arcalís area. However you can’t reach Ordino Arcalís from the towns mentioned above without a car. If you’re keen on skiing both sectors and getting the most out of your pass you’ll likely prefer to stay near Canillo Encamp or Andorra la Vella. Season Passes for Ski Aficionados If you’re planning on skiing at least two weeks this winter it may be worth buying a season pass. Andorra’s season tickets are heavily discounted when they’re released for sale each fall. Season passes usually provide more options than day entry. For instance Pal Arinsal and Ordino Arcalís day and week passes are sold as separate tickets. However if you want to ski both areas regularly it’s possible to purchase a combined season ticket known as the Valls de Nord pass. The most expensive and expansive resort Grandvalira comes with a variety of benefits including discounted parking a free one-day pass for a friend and discounts on restaurants and spas in the area. Best of all Grandvalira’s season pass provides free entry to other resorts around the world. For instance the 2019-2020 season pass includes three-day passes to Skirama Dolomiti Italy Kiroro Japan and Chapelco and Cerro Castor Argentina as well as a five-day pass to Verbier Switzerland. If those destinations are too far to interest you the Grandvalira ski pass also provides access to other resorts in the Pyrenees. You’ll receive a day pass for La Masella in the Spanish Pyrenees and unlimited access to the French Pyrenees resorts of Huatacam and Gavarnie Gèdre.

The epitome of German Romanticism. One of Europes most famous landmarks the romantic ruins of Heidelberg Castle have been attracting visitors since the 19th century. Display on the map Add to/remove from travel planner It is the paradox of seeing something so magnificent in a state of such beautiful ruin that gives Heidelberg Castle and its park such a captivating aura. The epitome of German romanticism its like something from another world. Even the majestic ruins overgrown with ivy still reflect the power and magnificence of the castles former residents the Wittelsbach dynasty. Built as a fortress with towers casemates and moats in around 1300 this castle perched high above the town developed over four hundred years into a symbol of the feudal power of the Palatinate Electors of the time. The oldest still discernibly residential building is the Ruprecht wing with its magnificent Renaissance fireplace. The Otto-Heinrich wing was the first castle building in Germany to have elaborate exterior decoration. The best-preserved building is the Friedrich wing whose facade with statues of the electors is like an ancestral portrait gallery. On the ground floor is the castle church still intact with residential rooms above. Particularly enchanting is the Hortus Palatinus pleasure garden an earthly paradise created by human hand during the reign of Friedrich V. For a long time this was considered the eighth wonder of the world even though it was never completed. On Saturdays the Life at court guided tour offers an insight into the everyday lives of the people who used to reside at Heidelberg Castle – an enthralling experience for all the family. The fascinating German Apothecary Museum in the Otto-Heinrich wing documents how medicines have been prepared and dispensed down the ages. Nearby attractions The Philosophers Walk Heidelbergs best-known and most scenic trail looks out over the old quarter and the castle amid the peace and quiet of nature.

Designed in 1619 by Juan Gómez de Mora and built in typical Herrerian style of which the slate spires are the most obvious expression its first public ceremony was suitably auspicious – the beatification of San Isidro Labrador St Isidore the Farm Labourer Madrid’s patron saint. Thereafter it was as if all that was controversial about Spain took place in this square. Bullfights often in celebration of royal weddings or births with royalty watching on from the balconies and up to 50000 people crammed into the plaza were a recurring theme until 1878. Far more notorious were the autos-da-fé the ritual condemnations of heretics during the Spanish Inquisition followed by executions – burnings at the stake and deaths by garrotte on the northern side of the square hangings to the south. These continued until 1790 when a fire largely destroyed the square which was subsequently reproduced under the supervision of Juan de Villanueva who lent his name to the building that now houses the Museo del Prado. These days the plaza is an epicentre of Madrid life. The grandeur of the plaza is due in large part to the warm colours of the uniformly ochre apartments with 237 wrought-iron balconies offset by the exquisite frescoes of the 17th-century Real Casa de la Panadería. The present frescoes date to just 1992 and are the work of artist Carlos Franco who chose images from the signs of the zodiac and gods eg Cybele to provide a stunning backdrop for the square. The frescoes were inaugurated to coincide with Madrid’s 1992 spell as the European Capital of Culture.

While the collection concentrates on Pablo Picassos formative years – potentially disappointing lovers of his better-known later works – there is enough material from subsequent periods to showcase the artists versatility and genius. Above all you come away feeling that Picasso was the true original always one step ahead of himself let alone anyone else in his search for new forms of expression. Tickets & tours Gothic Quarter & Picasso Museum Private tour £258.05 and up Details Picasso Museum and Gothic Quarter small group Tour £96.23 and up Details Gothic District and Picasso Museum Small Group Tour £104.98 and up Details More tickets & tours Details Carrer de Montcada 15-23 93 256 30 00 Visit website Hours10am-5pm Mon 9am-8.30pm Tue Wed & Fri-Sun to 9.30pm Thu Priceadult/concession/under 18yr permanent collection & temporary exhibit €14/7.50/free 6-9.30pm Thu & 1st Sun of month free The permanent collection is housed in the Palau Aguilar Palau del Baró de Castellet and Palau Meca all dating to the 14th century. The 18th-century Casa Mauri built over medieval remains even some Roman leftovers have been identified and the adjacent 14th-century Palau Finestres accommodate temporary exhibitions. The elegant courtyards galleries and staircases preserved in the first three buildings are as delightful as the collection inside. The collection which includes more than 3500 artworks is strongest on Picasso’s earliest years up until 1904 which is apt considering that the artist spent his formative creative years in Barcelona. Allegedly it was Picasso himself who proposed the museums creation in 1960 to his friend and personal secretary Jaume Sabartés a Barcelona native. Three years later the Sabartés Collection was opened since a museum bearing Picasso’s name would have been met with censorship – Picassos opposition to the Franco regime was well known. The Museu Picasso we see today opened in 1983. It originally held only Sabartés personal collection of Picassos art and a handful of other works but the collection gradually expanded with donations from Salvador Dalí and Sebastià Junyer Vidal among others. However the largest part of the present collection came from Picasso himself. His widow Jacqueline Roque also donated 41 ceramic pieces and the Woman with Bonnet painting after Picassos death. Sabartés contribution is honoured with Picassos famous Blue Period portrait of him wearing a ruff room B1. What makes this collection truly impressive – one-of-a-kind among the worlds many Picasso museums – is the way in which it displays Picassos extraordinary talent at such a young age. A visit starts with sketches and oils from his earliest years in Málaga and A Coruña 1893 to 1895. Some of his self-portraits and the portraits of his parents which date from 1896 are evidence enough of his precocious talent. Retrato de la tía Pepa Portrait of Aunt Pepa room 2 done in Málaga in 1896 shows the incredible maturity of his brushstrokes and his ability to portray character – at the tender age of 15. Picasso painted the enormous Ciència i caritat Science and Charity room 3 in the same year showcasing his masterful academic techniques of portraiture. His ingeniousness extends to his models too with his father standing in for the doctor and a beggar whom he hired off the street along with her offspring modelling the sick woman and the child. This painting caused the young artist to be noticed in the higher echelons of Spains art world when Ciència i caritat was awarded an Honorary Mention at the General Fine Arts Exhibition in Madrid in 1897. In rooms 5 to 7 hang paintings from his first Paris sojourn while room 8 is dedicated to the first significant new stage in his development the Blue Period. Woman with Bonnet is an important work from this period depicting a detainee from the Saint-Lazare womens prison and venereal disease hospital that Picasso visited when in Paris – this also sets up the theme of Picassos fascination with those inhabiting the down-and-out layers of society. His nocturnal blue-tinted views of Terrats de Barcelona Roofs of Barcelona room 8 and El foll The Madman often on loan are cold and cheerless yet somehow alive. Terrats de Barcelona was painted during his second stint at the 17 Carrer de la Riera Sant Joan studio in 1903 – he painted the city rooftops frequently from different perspectives in this period. A few cubist paintings pop up in rooms 10 and 11 check the Glass and Tobacco Packet still-life painting a beautiful and simple work. Picasso started to experiment with still life in 1924 – something hed done before but had not taken to as seriously as he would from here on. From 1954 to 1962 Picasso was obsessed with the idea of researching and ‘rediscovering’ the greats in particular Velázquez. In 1957 he made a series of renditions of Velázquez masterpiece Las Meninas The Ladies-in-Waiting now displayed in rooms 12 to 14. It is as though Picasso has looked at the original Velázquez painting through a prism reflecting all the styles he had worked through until then creating his own masterpiece in the process. This is a wonderful opportunity to see Las meninas in its entirety in a beautiful space. What is also special about the Museu Picasso is its showcasing of his work in lesser-known media. The last rooms contain Picassos engravings and 42 ceramic pieces completed throughout the latter years of his unceasingly creative life. Youll see plates and bowls decorated with simple single-line drawings of fish owls and other animal shapes typical for Picassos daubing on clay. Room 16 meanwhile displays portraits of Jacqueline from the 1960s.

Nestled in the high mountains near the Büyük Menderes Meander River is Denizli a city surrounded by a beautiful verdant valley in an area rich in culture and history. The Luvians were the first inhabitants followed by the Hittites centuries later. Throughout time the fertile plain nourished other civilizations too the Phrygians Lydians Persians Macedonians Romans Byzantines Seljuks and the Ottomans. Modern Denizli is a city of wide streets with parks and hotels. The Atatürk Ethnography Museum at the city centre displays folk art and ethnic artefacts. While shopping in the Kaleiçi Çarşısı look out for souvenirs of copper jewellery towels and silk blouses. You can make a choice among the nearby Çamlık İncilipınar or Gökpınar Parks for a rest a picnic or simply a walk through the forest in the shade of pine trees. The fresh-water springs there attract many visitors to thermal baths. Pamukkale is a fascinating expression by Mother Nature and the only example of its kind in the world and appears in almost every list of places to be seen before you die and visited by almost two million tourists each year. It is a place where nature assumed the role of artist and created such majestic beauty. The nearby ancient city of Hierapolis served as a thermal health center and visitors from various parts of Anatolia flocked to the city to receive a balneal treatment in search of health or beauty. In our age those who seek beauty or health still dip in the thermal pools. Another thermal centre northwest of Pamukkale is Karahayıt which makes a name for itself with the high iron content of its waters. Honaz Dağı National Park is located 20km to east of Denizli near the town of Honaz. Mt Honaz is one of the most beautiful and highest peaks 2528m of the Aegean region and is covered with gorgeous alpine forest. The remains of ancient Colossae a site of early Christian activity are visible from the northern slope. Hierapolis-Pamukkale Pamukkale meaning cotton castle is a natural attraction in southwestern Turkeys Denizli province. Unique in the world Pamukkale resembles a frozen waterfall with white layers of limestone and travertine cascading down a mountain slope approximately 2700m in length and 160m in height. Thermal spring waters laden with calcareous salts running off the plateaus edge have created a fantastic formation of stalactites cataracts and basins. At the end of the 2nd century BC the dynasty of Attalid the king of Pergamon established the thermal spa of Hierapolis close by. Situated on a plateau we find both the thermal centre and the ruins of the ancient city of Hierapolis. The ruins of the baths temples and other monuments can be observed at the site. It is not surprising that the ancient city of Hierapolis and Pamukkale are both included on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.

It’s a surreal enchanting place where the great Modernistas passion for natural forms really took flight and the artificial almost seems more natural than the natural. The park is extremely popular and access to the central area is limited to 400 people every half-hour – book ahead online. The rest of the park is free and can be visited without booking.

The project was a commercial flop and was abandoned in 1914 – but not before Gaudí had created 3km of roads and walks steps a plaza and two gatehouses in his inimitable manner. The idea was based on the English garden cities much admired by Güell hence the spelling of Park. In 1922 the city bought the estate for use as a public park. Much of the park is still wooded but it’s laced with pathways. The best views are from the cross-topped Turó de les Tres Creus Turó del Calvari in the southwest corner. Arriving via the parks main eastern entrance youll reach a broad open space the Plaça de la Natura whose centrepiece is the Banc de Trencadís completed in 1914. Curving sinuously around the perimeter this multicoloured tiled bench was designed by one of Gaudí’s closest colleagues architect Josep Maria Jujol 1879–1949. To the west of the square extends the Pòrtic de la Bugadera the Laundry Room Portico a gallery where the twisted stonework columns and roof give the effect of a cloister beneath tree roots – a motif repeated in several places in the park. With Gaudí however there is always more than meets the eye. The giant Plaça de la Natura was designed as a kind of catchment area for rainwater washing down the hillside. The water is filtered through a layer of stone and sand and drains down through the columns below to an underground cistern. Beneath the square steps guarded by a much-photographed mosaic dragon/lizard lead to the Sala Hipóstila the Doric Temple. This forest of 86 stone columns – some leaning like mighty trees bent by the weight of time – was originally intended as a market with its tiled ceilings and Catalan vaults. On the east side of the Sala Hipóstila are the lavender-scented Jardins dÀustria. Just inside the parks southern Carrer d’Olot entrance which sits below the Sala Hipóstila and is immediately recognisable by the two Hansel-and-Gretel gatehouses stands the Casa del Guarda. This typically curvaceous former porter’s home hosts a display on Gaudí’s building methods and the history of the park. There are superb views from the top floor and often long queues to get in. The spired rosy-pink house over by the eastern entrance is the Casa-Museu Gaudí where Gaudí lived for most of his last 20 years 1906–26. It contains furniture designed by him including items that were once at home in La Pedrera Casa Batlló Casa Calvet and Colonia Güell and other memorabilia. The house was built in 1904 by Francesc Berenguer i Mestres as a prototype for the 60 or so houses that were originally planned here. One-hour guided tours in multiple languages take place year-round and cost €12 plus park admission pre-book online. Private guided tours cost €45 per person plus admission minimum two people. The Bus Güell shuttle 15 minutes included in pre-bought tickets was introduced in 2019 zipping visitors from Alfons X metro stop línia 4 to the parks eastern entrance on Carretera del Carmel. Arriving by this route youll enter the restricted area from the top at the Plaça de la Natura. Alternatively its a 20-minute walk from Lesseps or Vallcarca metro stops the uphill trek is eased by escalators. Buses H6 and D40 stop on Travessera de Dalt 10 minutes walk south of the park via Avinguda del Santuari de Sant Josep de la Muntaya with escalators. Bus V19 stops at the eastern entrance.

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1b0,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/nemrut,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Nemrut Mountain of Gods HomeDestinationsNemrut The Mount Nemrut is one the highest peaks of the Mesopotamia and its summit at 2206 metres above the sea level contains the tomb of King Antiochus I of Commagene commissioned by himself. The gigantic statues of gods each weighing 6 tons and 10 metres tall indicate what kind of super-human effort was spent on the construction of the tomb. Boulders were the main material used and they were carried up the mountain from the valley below and similarly the crushed rock pieces used to pile over the main tomb chamber in order to create a 50 ‑metre high cone with 150-metre diameter base were carried the same way. This creative scheme has proven to be effective and prevented grave robbers accessing to the inner sanctum. The tomb chamber is yet to be accessed and the treasures inside are awaiting discovery. However the statues of gods and the sanctuary formed along the three aspects of the tumulus are considered unique and consequently it was inscribed in the UNESCO List of World Heritage. Junction of Eastern and Western Civilisations Heritage of Commagene Kingdom The Commagene Kingdom dominated the region for almost two centuries between 109 BC and 72 AD and it appears to be a remarkable civilisation unifying the cultures and beliefs of Macedonian and Persian civilisations. It is also indicative that Mithridates I Callinicus the founder of the kingdom had ancestral lineage deriving from both Darius the Great of Achaemenid Empire and Alexander the Great of the Kingdom of Macedon and that relationship had a bearing on this unifying process. For a while Commagene Kingdom was the most powerful state of the region and other structures of its spectacular heritage could be seen in the Adıyaman province. The burial place of female members of Commagene royal family which is known as the Giant Eagle Royal Karakus Tumulus is adorned with four tall pedestals – today only one of them stand erect with an eagle sculpture on top the Necropolis of Perre which was situated in one of the largest settlements near Pirin Village where the floor mosaics were unearthed Arsameia Eskikale one of the temene of the Kingdom where once the palaces were standing are the other sites to visit for those who wish to learn about that civilisation more closely. Those who are interested in history of cultures would also find artefacts and structures from other civilisations that survived on this land which cradled various civilisations for thousands of years. One of the oldest Roman bridges in Anatolia is the Severan Bridge Cendere Köprüsü from the 1st century AD which was built by the Commagene Kingdom. The other is the New Castle in Old Kahta which was believed to be founded in 2nd century BC but extensively rebuilt during the Mamluk Sultane domination of the region. A Magnificent Sunrise One of the essential rituals of visiting Mount Nemrut is enjoying the sunrise from the summit. King Antiochus revering his ancestors in Western and Eastern civilisations erected giant statues of gods on the East and West terraces and cited their names both in Persian and Greek. So visitors enjoy watching the unique sunrise together with the statues of gods who have been witnessing it for two thousand years. How to Go? The Mount Nemrut Tumulus is in Kahta county which is 86 km east of Adıyaman city. There are scheduled flights to Adiyaman Airport from Istanbul and Ankara. The best season for ascent to the Mount is the period between April and October.

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1b1,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/gobeklitepe,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Gobeklitepe The first temple of the world HomeDestinationsGobeklitepe One of the most important archaeological sites in the world. The Neolithic archaeological ruins were first uncovered in the 60s. The Architecture was far ahead of its time. There are substantial grounds to claim that the most significant archaeological discovery of the 21st century is the Göbeklitepe. First of all it dates back to 12 thousand years ago. In other words it’s approximately 8 thousand years older than the pyramids and 7 thousand years older than the Stonehenge. Furthermore it is even older than the human transition to settled life. Therefore contrary to the widely held view it proves the existence of religious beliefs prior to the establishment of the first cities. Findings of researchers at Göbeklitepe shows that a religious class existed even at such early ages division of society into social classes took place well before the widely assumed dates and perhaps the first agricultural activity may have been conducted in the region. The site is also remarkable with the first patriarchal thought the first terrazzo flooring and the first statues and reliefs of the Neolithic Age. As a result all this new information has been added to the collective knowledge of humanity and into the history books. On the merits of its contribution to human history Göbeklitepe was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018. A Beginners Guide To Göbeklitepe What Does Zero Point In Time Mean? Discovery That Changed The Human History While the discovery of Göbeklitepe site took place in 1963 the first scientific excavation started in 1995 eventual findings of which added new pages to the history changing long standing assumptions. Rather than being used as a settlement the area actually served religious purposes and contain a number of temples. In that respect it is not only the oldest centre of worship but also the largest one. Although six of those temples were unearthed to date on the basis of geomagnetic surveys the total number of those monumental structures is believed to be twenty with all temples sharing a resemblance to each other making this entire region suggestive of being a centre of faith and pilgrimage during the Neolithic Age. There are six-metre-tall T-shaped stone pillars carved with reliefs of animals erected to form circles. Those carvings that maybe the earliest three dimensional depictions of animals carved into stone are testament to the artistic ability of our ancestors. Professor Klaus Schmidt who had led the excavation work in the site for 20 years firmly stated that the T-shaped stone pillars represented human figures since some of them have carvings of hands and fingers. Followed by the World Since unearthing the monumental structures Göbeklitepe attracted attention of the world and many articles about it were published and many documentaries were produced. The BBC broadcast a documentary and The Guardian published an article yet the most striking comments were published by German weekly Der Spiegel. The journal had a sensational suggestion the Göbeklitepe was the place where Adam and Eve settled after being banished from the Garden of Eden. The journal based its suggestion on the coincidence that the land surrounding the Göbeklitepe is proven to be the place where wheat was cultivated for the first time and the Bible says that Adam was the first to cultivate the wheat after he was banished. Unanswered Questions While Göbeklitepe revealed many important points there are still questions waiting to be answered by the scientists. By whom those temples were built? How were those 60-ton stone pillars carried and erected? Why were they buried with tons of rock and earth? What was the actual purpose for which they were constructed? These are outstanding mysteries which will probably be resolved following years of further study. What we know for certain is the fact that future findings in Göbeklitepe will continue furthering knowledge about human history and revise the accepted discourse. Where To Stay Around Göbeklitepe 4 Nearest Cities And Atractions For Your Journey Why to Visit Göbeklitepe? It is the first Temple of the World. It is believed to be a centre of faith and pilgrimage during the Neolithic Age. The earliest three-dimensional depictions carved into stone are found here. According to scientists the archaeological discovery of Göbeklitepe changed human history. It proves the existence of religious beliefs prior to the establishment of the first cities. It is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. How to Go?

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1b2,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/canakkale,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Çanakkale From Troy to Gallipoli HomeDestinationsÇanakkale Çanakkale is the honourable resting place for the soldiers who lost their lives in Gelibolu. The city of Çanakkale lies at the narrow 1200m entrance to the Çanakkale Strait Dardanelles that connects the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean. Passenger and car ferries run daily between Çanakkale on the Asian side and Eceabat and Kilitbahir on the European side. Yachts navigating the straits stop at the well-equipped Çanakkale Marina to allow tourists more time in the area. Hotels restaurants and cafes along the promenade offer visitors a place to enjoy the harbour as well as providing a view of the Kilitbahir Fortress and Çanakkale Archaeological Museum. What is more the Archaeological Site of Troy was added to the World Heritage Cultural List of UNESCO inviting history fans to its magnificent ancient settlement ruins. In 1451 Sultan Mehmet II the conqueror of İstanbul built one fortress on the European side of the Çanakkale Strait at Kilitbahir and one on the opposite shore at Çimenlik to control the passage of ships through the strait. Today the Çimenlik Fortress serves as a military museum dedicated to the World War I Battles of Çanakkale. The Historic National Park of the Gelibolu Peninsula was established to honour the 500000 soldiers who lost their lives in Gelibolu also known as Gallipoli. In 1915 Mustafa Kemal the commander of the Turkish army led a successful campaign to drive out allied powers from the area. The park accommodates memorials monuments and cemeteries as well as the natural beauty of the Arıburnu Cliffs and Tuz Gölü Salt Lake. The beauty of the green hills sandy beaches and blue waters are an honourable resting place for the soldiers who bravely fought and died in this historic battle. One cannot help but sense the heart of the Turkish nation in the patriotic spirit of Gallipoli. As the largest of the Turkish islands Gökçeada is ringed with pristine bays. Its hills covered with the green of pine and olive trees are dotted with sacred springs and monasteries. Regular ferry boats make the trip from Çanakkale and Kabatepe possible and in August both islanders and tourists gather for colourful local fairs. As you get near to Bozcaada Island the Venetian castle captures your attention. Then your eyes are drawn to the glistening white houses and restaurants and cafes which line the promenade. Wine seems as plentiful as water on this island and a tour reveals many vineyards and wine cellars. There are good sandy beaches at Ayazma Poyraz and İğdelik. Archaeological Site of Troy Contrary to popular opinion the archaeological site of Troy does not embody just one ancient city. In fact this site comprises the ruins of at least nine different settlements built one on top of the other dating back to the early Bronze Age. The first city was founded in the 3rd millenium BC and flourished as a mercantile city due to its location. This unique site enabled its inhabitants to control the Dardanelles todays Çanakkale Strait a waterway which is used by every merchant ship passing from the Aegean Sea and heading for Black Sea. The extensive remains at this archaeological site are the most significant demonstration of the first contact between the civilizations of Anatolia and the Mediterranean world. Naturally Troy is one of immense significance to understand the early development of European civilization at such critical stage. Moreover Troy is of exceptional cultural importance because of the profound influence of Homers Iliad on the creative arts over more than two millenia. Legends and Temples Homer immortalized Troia Troy in his stories of King Priam Hector Paris and the beautiful Helen. Archaeological excavations have revealed nine separate periods of settlement here including ruins of city walls house foundations a temple and a theatre. A large and symbolic wooden Trojan horse marks the legendary war today. The ancient harbour of Alexandria-Troas was built in the 3rd century BC and St Paul passed through the city twice on his third missionary journey going on to Assos. The acropolis of Assos Behramkale is 238m above sea level with the Temple of Athena being constructed on this site in the 6th century BC. This Doric temple is currently being restored to its former glory and role as guardian of the Biga Peninsula and Gulf of Edremit. Wander around to see the moonlight scattered through the temple ruins! Or rise early for the awakening dawn over the acropolis! From the top you can take in the magnificent vista of the Gulf of Edremit and appreciate this heavenly location. On the terraces descending to the sea are agoras a gymnasium and a theatre and from the northern corner of the acropolis you can see a mosque a bridge and a fortress all built by Sultan Murat I in the 14th century. Down below lies a tiny and idyllic ancient harbour. Assos has gained the reputation of being the centre of the Turkish artistic community with its lively friendly and bohemian atmosphere – this may be the place you will always remember for years to come. In the village of Gülpınar 25km west of Behramkale is the ancient city of Chryse where the 2nd-century BC temple of Apollo is located. Babakale a scenic village of houses terraced on a cliff which drops to the sea is 15km west of Gülpınar that is located on an unmarked road that follows the jagged coastline. A city you will remember for years to come… The Legend Unveiled The town of Biga has given its name to an entire peninsula it is a town of parks and a good place to see houses built in the traditional style. The closest beaches are at Karabiga Şahmelek and Kemer where you will find reasonably priced accommodation. Karabiga was associated in ancient times with the god Priapos and thus has roots of fertility cult. Çan is well known for its ceramics and sulphur springs which are thought to be helpful for various disorders of liver intestine and urinary tract. Two other hot springs can be found at nearby Külcüler and Kirazlı. Kaz Dağı Mount Ida 1774m is situated at the southern tip of Çanakkale and in the beautiful Kaz Dağı National Park among its magnificent landscapes restful green areas and several hot springs. Here in Pınarbaşı the world’s first beauty contest was held between Aphrodite Hera and Athena. According to the legend the Evil Goddess of Discord Eris who was not invited to the marriage banquet of King Peleus and the sea nymph Thetis threw a golden apple marked For the fairest into the banqueting hall. All the goddesses wanted it and in the end the choice was narrowed down to Aphrodite Hera and Athena. They asked Zeus to judge but he refused and told them to go to Mount Ida near Troy where the young prince Paris would judge their cases. Paris was doing shepherds work as his father Priam the King of Troy had been warned that this Prince would some day be the ruin of his country and so had sent him away. The goddesses all offered him bribes so the choice was not easy. Hera promised to make him the Lord of Europe and Asia Athena that he would lead the Trojans to victory in war and Aphrodite that the fairest woman in the world should be his. He chose the last and gave Aphrodite the golden apple. That was the judgement of Paris famed everywhere as the real reason behind the Trojan War. You can find magnificent landscapes historical places and restful green areas in Çanakkale. A knowledge of mythology is not a prerequisite for enjoying the beautiful restful green of Pınarbaşı though with its hundreds of fresh springs beautiful trees shading the picnic areas and the invigorating hot springs of Güre. At the northern entrance to Kaz Dağı National Park via Bayramiç and Evciler are the main daily camping facilities. Haklım Hamdibey and Akçakoyun are the towns popular for nature tourism.

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1b7,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/adana,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Adana Land of Nature Culture and Cuisine HomeDestinationsAdana While history buffs can enjoy exploring the ruins of ancient cities nature-lovers find repose breathing the cool clean air in the Taurus Mountains. Set in the heart of the Çukurova Cilician Plain Turkeys fourth largest city Adana has a history that goes back as far as the 7th millennium BC. The numerous civilizations that occupied and dominated the land left layers of archaeological treasures clues for the regions complex past. While history buffs can enjoy exploring the ruins of ancient cities nature-lovers find repose breathing the cool clean air on the slopes and plateaus of the Taurus Mountains. Mysteries of the ancient civilizations Adana is one of those rare cities that have remained important throughout history. Occupying a key strategic location on both the trading routes and military roads Adana has been settled ceaselessly while the civilizations ruling the city have changed sporadically. Eighteen civilizations have ruled the city with each leaving their imprint whether a building monument or inscription as if trying to make their dominion eternal over the region. Each civilization that coveted and won the region can today be traced in the ruins they left behind. The mysteries of the civilizations that have played a role in the history of Adana are sometimes concealed in ancient cities and sometimes in earthen mounds that crop up on the plains around the cities. There are more than ten significant ancient settlements in the province that amply demonstrate the historical and cultural wealth to which modern Adana is heir. The ancient city of Misis is located on the banks of the Ceyhan River on the highway between Adana and Ceyhan. The history of this ancient settlement called Yakapınar today goes back three millennia to the Hittite Period when the city was built on the primary military and trading roads. The nine-arch Misis Bridge across the Ceyhan River was built in the 4th century AD during the Roman Era and the Misis Mosaics Museum houses mosaics found in local excavations. Near the coastal town of Yumurtalık are the ruins of the ancient city of Ayas. The city includes ruins of Asclepeion. Other structures worth visiting in town are the Liman Harbour Castle the Tower of Süleyman and Marco Polos pier Magarsus that was established on the land stretching from the sea cliffs to the present day village of Küçük Karataş. It was the religious centre of the ancient city of Mallos which was one of the prime cities of ancient Cilicia renowned for its temples in particular for the Temple of Athena where Alexander the Great once prayed. The ancient city of Anazarbus Anavarza included in the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List became the capital of Cilicia in 408. It is an open-air museum showcasing a superb triumphal arch fortress columns and two mosaic-paved pools. Şar was an important centre for the Hittites with the most striking structure being the Ala Gate- part of a temple erected in the 2nd century AD during the Roman Era. Revealing the secret history of Adana the excavations in present day neighbourhood of Tepebağ are in progress. Findings from the Tepebağ mound include ancient artefacts and fine examples of late Ottoman civilian architecture. Inherited from past generations Visitors can also see the historical structures at the city centre that shed further light on history. The 310m-long Taşköprü Stone Bridge built by Hadrian and repaired by Justinian spans the Seyhan River which bisects the town only 14 of the bridges original 21 arches still stand. The oldest mosque in Adana is the Akça or Ağca Masjid completed in 1489. Also of interest is Ulu Mosque built in 1509 one of Adanas oldest mosques. Famous for its glazed tiles the mosque is situated next to the Akça Masjid. To the east there is a madrasah originally built in 1540. Mestanzade Mosque which was completed in 1682 is believed to be one of the earliest examples of the Western influence in Ottoman architecture. Near the Mestanzade Mosque stands the Yeni Mosque built in 1724 in a style that clearly indicates the influence of Mamluk architecture and decorative arts. The Hasan Ağa Mosque was completed in 1558 and is the only example of classical Ottoman architecture in the city centre. As the largest mosque in Turkey Sabancı Mosques classical appearance belies its recent construction it is an indispensable image of Adana that is featured on innumerable postcards. The Hoşkadem Mosque located in the Fortress of Kozan was commissioned by the Sultan of Egypt Emir Abdullah Hoşkadem in 1448 and built in Mamluk style. The trading importance of Adana is the reason why many caravanserais and inns were built to accommodate goods and traders on their journeys. The 18th century Kurtkulağı Caravanserai in the village of Kurtkulağı and the Tuz Inn are still in a reasonably preserved state. The Tuz Inn was actually part of the oldest Turkish mansion the Ramazanoğlu Mansion which was built in 1495. It is where the Ottoman sultans stayed when their military campaigns passed through Adana. The Catholic Church of St Paul was built in the 1880s in the Tepebağ neighbourhood. The two-and-a half metre bronze statue of the Virgin Mary that tops the church’s gable wall gives it the popular name of Bebekli Church literally the church with a doll. The Yağ Mosque which stands next to a madrasah was once a church. With the addition of a minaret in 1501 during the Ramazanoğulları Principality it began to serve as a mosque. Any tour of the city must also include the charming Ethnography Museum the Atatürk Culture Museum and the Archaeological Museum which displays locally excavated Hittite and Roman remains. Peaceful nature In the north of the city at the Seyhan Dam and Lake are shady walks quaint tea gardens and restaurants set in cool spots where you can escape the heat. At sunset look back toward the city to the peaceful winding ruby river lined with twinkling lights. Adanas coastline is short especially when compared with that of other provinces along the Turkish Riviera. However some of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey lie along this coastline where visitors can swim in crystal clear waters and feast their eyes on the riches of local culture landscape and history. Karataş Beach just half an hour from Adana is next to the ruins of the ancient city of Magarsus. Explore the ruins and after your arduous walk dive straight into the sea for a refreshing swim – all in one exhilarating day! The exceptionally beautiful beach at Yumurtalık is within striking distance of the ruins at Ayas and the area is home to other fortresses and sites of historical interest. The summer months in Adana are swelteringly hot and its inhabitants have found that the best way to cope it is to retire to the mountain plateaus that surround the city. Hundreds of years of summer tradition have made the plateaus a distinct part of the culture of Adana. The timber houses as well as such handicrafts as wood and copper artefacts and utensils kilims rugs and woven fabrics made by the yörük nomadic herders who live in mountains are the physical elements that have shaped the culture of the plateaus. Horzum Çulluuşağı Belemedik Akçatekir and Armutoğlu are among the plateaus that nature-lovers can enjoy visiting. After a day of sightseeing you can enjoy an Adana kebab a sensational spicy kebab made of ground meat as tasting local beverages like shalgam a drink made from dark turnips and shıra a type of grape juice. The regions classical cuisine will delight the palate of the most discriminating gourmet.

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1b8,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/istanbul,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Istanbul The Imperial Capital HomeDestinationsIstanbul For more than 1500 years Istanbul was the capital of Roman Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. With one arm reaching out to Asia and the other to Europe Istanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. The Bosphorus courses the waters of the Black Sea the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn through the citys heart. Istanbuls fate has been sealed by its vital strategic location and its enchanting natural beauty. For more than 1500 years it was the capital of three empires Roman Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires. It was beautified accordingly with magnificent monuments and became a metropolis where diverse cultures nations and religions mingled. Those cultures nations and religions are the small pieces that form the mosaic of Istanbul. Istanbuls most important building works started in the Byzantine period and the city was then embellished further during the days of the Ottoman Empire. Modern and Traditional Together It is Istanbuls endless variety that fascinates its visitors. The museums churches palaces grand mosques bazaars and sites of natural beauty are countless. As relaxing on the western shores of the Bosphorus at sunset and watching the red evening light reflected on the other continent you may suddenly and profoundly understand why so many centuries ago settlers chose to build a city on this remarkable site. At such times you can see why Istanbul is truly one of the most glorious cities in the world. Istanbul is Turkeys most developed and largest city with the latest discoveries indicating that the history of human habitation there goes back some 400000 years. The purple years of Istanbul may have started in 330 when Emperor Constantine declared the city the capital of his empire – royal purple is the colour of the Byzantine imperial family. Until 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottomans the city served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire. During the reign of the Byzantines Istanbul was adorned with a number of great monuments which made it the most magnificent city in the world even during the declining years of the empire. Striking Multireligious Identity The identity of Istanbul that began with the Byzantines was further shaped during the period of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror declared Istanbul the capital of Ottoman Empire after he conquered the city in 1453. Over the next 450 years the city was adorned with superb Ottoman monuments. Building works after the conquest gathered apace during the reign of Sultan Bayezid II with the finest works built by Mimar Sinan the Chief Royal Architect. This worldfamous architect put his signature on the silhouette of Istanbul with a number of masterpieces. The Ottomans were tolerant towards all religions and dedicated many places of worship to the Christian and Jewish communities so that these peoples could practise their religion undisturbed. Thus in Istanbul mosques churches and synagogues stood and still stand side by side as the physical evidence of Istanbul and a symbol of tolerance and fraternity of religions. GLORIOUS TREASURES As an imperial capital of 1500 years Istanbul is rich in architectural monuments reflecting its past splendour. At every turn in the city one can happen upon Roman Byzantine and Ottoman palaces mosques churches monasteries monuments walls and ruins. The old city centre with its places of worship government trade and entertainment was where the citizens mingled enjoying the benefits of the security and bounty of the state while maintaining their culture and way of life. The most magnificent of Istanbuls monuments are clustered on the historical peninsula the triangular piece of land surrounded by the Sea of Marmara to the east and south by the Golden Horn to the north and by the city walls to the west. The Historic Areas of Istanbul was inscribed on the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1985 enchanting visitors with an impressive texture. Sultanahmet Square is the core of the historical peninsula and the most prominent examples of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture can be seen in close proximity here. Living Heritages of Byzantines During the Byzantine Period the centre of the city was the Hippodrome and its environs. The Palace was the centre of power the Hagia Sophia Ayasofya the most spectacular of the religious buildings the Hippodrome served as the common entertainment centre and the Yerebatan Sarnıcı Basilica Cistern supplied most of the citys water – all are to be found at the centre of the city. During Ottoman times the square where the Hippodrome once stood became the site for the circumcision ceremonies of the Sultans sons. The Hagia Sophia is referred to as the 8th wonder of the world. Great Mystic Symbols The most glorious architectural heritage of the Byzantine Empire is the Hagia Sophia which is referred to as the 8th Wonder of the World. Aged more than 1500 years old it is one of the great symbols of Istanbul. The mosaics of Hagia Sophia which were uncovered after it became a museum are the foremost examples of Byzantine art of the 9th to 12th centuries. The Kariye Museum Chora Church is another Byzantine monument famous for its fine mosaics and frescoes. The Neve Shalom Ahrida and Aşkenazi synagogues are three of the most important sacred places for Judaism in Istanbul. The Topkapı Palace is particularly important for the Mukaddes Emanetler Dairesi Chamber of Holy Relics where the Prophet Muhammeds Hırka-i Saadet Blessed Mantle and Sancak-ı Şerif Holy Banner are kept in their golden chests. The Sultan Ahmet Mosque also known as the Blue Mosque was built between 1609 and 1616 and houses the tomb of its founder Sultan Ahmed I a madrasah and a hospice. Historic Areas of Istanbul The Historic Areas of Istanbul inscribed in the World Heritage List in 1985 cover four main areas the Archaeological Park the Süleymaniye Mosque and its associated Conservation Area Zeyrek Mosque and its asscoiated Conservation Area and the City Walls of Istanbul. In its evalulation report the International Council on Monuments and Sites has stated that one cannot conceive of the World Heritage List without Istanbul which has been associated with the world’s major political religious and artistic events for over 2000 years. The cultural property in this area includes unique monuments and masterpieces of universal architecture two of which are the Hagia Sophia Ayasofya built by Anthemios of Tralles and Isidoros of Milet in 532-537 and the Süleymaniye Mosque a masterpiece of Sinan the Great Architect. The 6650m city walls of Theodosius II with its second line of defences created in 447 has been one of the leading references for military architecture. The Other Shore Another historical area of Istanbul on the opposite shore of the Golden Horn is the former district of Pera meaning the other shore. Settled by Genoese and Venetians in the 12th century this quarter was inhabited mostly by Levantines and represented the western face of the city. The cosmopolitan character of ancient Istanbul is reflected in the following buildings there the Galata Tower built by the Genoese stately consulates which were embassies before the capital was moved to Ankara and the art nouveau buildings of İstiklal Avenue. St Antoine Cathedral a silent and tranquil spot on this avenue is visited frequently by devout visitors from every religion. Palaces summer palaces castles and large mansions built by the Ottomans continue to adorn Istanbul. The Yıldız Palace and the Dolmabahçe on the shores of the Bosphorus were once the residences of the Ottoman Sultans after Topkapı Palace. Istanbul is also famous for the elegant wooden houses the yalı built along the shores of the strait. THE NEW Istanbul Building on its assets inherited from a glorious past Istanbul is an international city with a financial and economic centre offering services in banking telecommunications marketing engineering and tourism. International conferences and festivals fairs fashion shows sports and art performances give a new dimension to the life and potential of the city. Istanbul is one of the busiest centres of congress travel in the world offering every support and service to conferences of all sizes. Great service is available due to Istanbuls excellent transportation and communication facilities and a wide choice of accommodation equipped with the latest technology. THE BOSPHORUS A stay in Istanbul is not complete without a traditional and unforgettable boat excursion up the Bosphorus the strait that separates Europe and Asia. Its shores offer a delightful mixture of past and present grand splendour and simple beauty. Modern hotels stand next to yalı waterfront wooden villas marble palaces abut on rustic stone fortresses and elegant compounds neighbour small fishing villages. The best way to see the Bosphorus is to board one of the passenger boats that regularly zigzag along the shores. Embark at Eminönü and stop alternately on the Asian and European sides of the strait! The round-trip excursion very reasonably priced takes about six hours. For those who want a private voyage there are agencies that specialize in organizing day or night-time mini-cruises. During the trip you will go past the magnificent Dolmabahçe Palace while further along rise the green parks and imperial pavilions of the Yıldız Palace. To the waterfront of the parks stands the Çırağan Palace refurbished in 1874 by Sultan Abdülaziz and now restored as a grand hotel. For 300m along the Bosphorus shore its ornate marble facades reflect the swiftly moving water. At Ortaköy the next stop every Sunday artists gather to exhibit their works in a streetside gallery with the variety of people creating a lively scene. Sample a tasty kumpir baked potato from one of the street vendors. And note its church mosque and synagogue that have existed side by side for hundreds of years – a tribute to Turkeys tolerance at the grass-roots level. Overshadowing Istanbuls traditional architecture at Ortaköy is one of the worlds largest suspension bridges the Boğaziçi Bridge linking Europe and Asia. Shore Excursion The beautiful Beylerbeyi Palace lies just past the bridge on the Asian side and behind the palace rises Çamlıca Hill the highest point in Istanbul. You can also drive here to admire the magnificent panorama of Istanbul as well as the beautiful landscaped gardens. On the opposite shore the wooden Ottoman villas of Arnavutköy create a contrast with the luxurious modern apartments of neighbouring Bebek. A few kilometres further along stand the fortresses of Rumeli Hisarı Rumelian Fortress and Anadolu Hisarı Anatolian Fortress facing each other across the straits like watchful protectors. The Göksu Palace sometimes known as Küçüksu Palace graces the Asian shore next to Anadolu Hisarı. As the second link between the two continents the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge straddles the waterway just past these two fortresses. From Duatepe Hill on the European side you can wonder at the magnificent panorama of the bridge and the Bosphorus. Below Duatepe beautiful Emirgan Park bursts with colour when its tulips bloom in the spring. On the Asian shore is Kanlıca a fishing village that is now a favoured suburb for wealthy Istanbul residents crowds gather in the restaurants and cafes along its shores to sample its famous yogurt. Shortly after Kanlıca and Çubuklu is the Beykoz Korusu İbrahim Paşa Woods a popular retreat – in the cafes and restaurants there you can enjoy the delightful scenery and clean fresh air. Back on the European side at Tarabya Bay yachts seem to dance at the moorings. The coastal road then bustles with taverns and fish restaurants from Tarabya to the charming suburbs of Sarıyer and Büyükdere. Sarıyer has one of the largest fish markets in Istanbul and is also famous for its delicious varieties of milk puddings and börek pastries. After Sarıyer the narrow strait widens and opens into the Black Sea. THE GOLDEN HORN HALİÇ This horn-shaped estuary known as the Golden Horn divides European Istanbul into two. As one of the best natural harbours in the world the Byzantine and Ottoman navies and their commercial shipping interests were centred here. Today lovely parks and promenades line the shores where the setting sun casts a golden hue on the water. At Fener and Balat neighbourhoods midway up to the Golden Horn whole streets full of old wooden houses churches and synagogues date from Byzantine and Ottoman times while the Orthodox Patriarchy resides at Fener. Eyüp a little further up is full of Ottoman architecture much of it restored and cemeteries dotted with dark cypress trees covering the hillsides. Many believers come to the Tomb of Eyüp in the hope that their prayers will be granted. The Pierre Loti Cafe atop the hill overlooking the shrine is a wonderful place to enjoy an alternative view of Istanbul.

Pergamon was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2014 and it has been one the rare settlements that has survived several invasions and devastations over the ages but reoccupied again on the merits of its strategic location. As confirmed by the findings of the excavations held prehistory of Pergamon reaches back to second millennia BC. The city survived Persian domination and conquest of Alexander the Great. The most brilliant phase of its history lasted almost one hundred and fifty years when it was the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon during 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. At this time one of the largest libraries of the world was built here and the city became a healing centre. The arts also flourished and the city particularly became renowned for magnificent sculptures. During the Roman period Pergamon maintained its significance and developed further becoming the most famous and magnificent city of the Asia Minor as described by the 1st century AD philosopher and author Pliny the Elder. Visiting Bergama would provide you a chance to trace the steps of the ancient city Pergamon through several unique experiences. The City of Firsts Every year almost a million people visit Bergama and the ruins of ancient city Pergamon which has witnessed many firsts in its history. One of the most significant of these was the first ever use of parchment. Invention of script has been a major breakthrough for the history of humanity and innovation of parchment was quite important as it created a medium enabling quick and stable recording of scripts. The development of parchment allowed Pergamon to create a library of manuscripts that rivalled the world renowned library of Alexandria and paved the way to develop the city as an important centre of arts and science in the 2nd century BC. Pergamon had one of the first Seven Churches of early Christianity and its name is cited in the Bible. The first theatre with a wooden stage first trade union first market law first public building regulation first strike and collective agreement were amongst other firsts that took place in the history of Pergamon. Open Air Museum The principal ruins of the ancient Pergamon comprising all the religious social and commercial structures are in the acropolis and the most remarkable of these include the ruins of Pergamon Library which was one of the largest of the world in that era and hosted a collection of 200 thousand manuscripts the ten thousand seat theatre where the audience enjoyed the magnificent vista of Pergamon Valley the Sanctuary of Athena and the Temple of Dionysus the Sanctuary of Trajan the Pergamon Gymnasium which was one the most important learning institutions of the Hellenistic Era and the Royal Palaces of Pergamon. The Base of Great Altar of Pergamon or the Zeus Altar could also be seen in the Acropolis. However the whole superstructure of the Altar was dismantled and transported to Germany in the late Ottoman Era and it is now on display in Berlin – the Altar and its friezes show the best examples of the art and architecture of Pergamon in the Hellenistic Era. The Sanctuary of Asclepius which was one of the principal healing centres of the Antiquity where the patients were treated with sound of water mud baths and waters of a healing spring. Pergamon was also the home of physician Galen father of pharmacology making the city stand out in the history of medicine and pharmacology. The Serapis Temple dedicated to Egyptian gods was one of the principal structures of the Roman era and it was renowned as the Red Basilica due to the colour of bricks used. During the Byzantine era this noticeably huge structure was converted to a church which is one of the first Seven Churches cited in the Bible. Following the Roman and Byzantine eras Pergamon came under Turkish domination. Today’s Bergama contains examples of the Seljuk and Ottoman architecture such as mosques bathhouses and bridges. Most prominent of these include the Ulu Cami the Grand Mosque Selçuklu Minaresi the Seljuk Minaret Şadırvan Cami the Ablution Fountain Mosque Çukur Han the Sunk Caravanserai and Taş Han the Stone Caravanserai. There are also examples of 18th and 19th century civil architecture at the Kale Mahallesi Citadel Neighbourhood which is situated at the lower slopes of the hill where the Pergamon city was once built. Museum of Bergama Gateway to Arts of Antiquity The art of sculpture reached its peak in the 2nd century BC in Pergamon and statues created in that era are admired even today. The Pergamon style became one of the principle schools of sculpture magnificent examples of which could be seen in the Museum of Bergama. The most striking works are the statues of gods goddesses and emperors which were unearthed in the excavations carried out in the environs of Pergamon. Although the most prominent displays of the Museum are the sculptures there are also other artefacts from various eras on permanent display. The ethnographical department would be very interesting for those who have a keen eye for the popular culture too. Historical Spas of Kings and Queens The thermal springs of Pergamon made the city one of the principal centres of healing and beauty in the antiquity and many of them reached our times. One of the major thermal spas of Pergamon is within the Sanctuary of Asclepius Güzellik Ilıcası which is 4 km to Bergama. It is believed to be commissioned by King Euamens of Pergamon and provided beautifying services to Cleopatra who enjoyed bathing there. For Nature Lovers Alongside its historic and cultural heritage Bergama also harbours an outstanding natural beauty. Trekking along the route to Kozak Plateau through the pine forests covering the Kozak mountain range between Bergama and Ayvalık dotted with ruins and rural landscapes also provide opportunities for photo safaris. How to Go? Bergama is about hundred kilometres to Izmir the largest city of Turkey at the coast of Aegean Sea. The Adnan Menderes International Airport has scheduled and charter connections to all major European airports. Also a number of cities across Turkey are connected to Izmir by air rail and road.

5eae9dae2dae09d3a6b6b1c0,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/alanya,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Alanya From Antiquity to the Present Day HomeDestinationsAlanya Are you ready to open your door to an ideal holiday of recreation entertainment learning and culinary enjoyment? The beauty of Alanya makes it a magnet for tourists and provides everything you could dream of in a holiday. The countys unique geographical and cultural texture the attractive and comfortable hotels lining the turquoise blue Mediterranean Sea and the rich tastes of the world renowned Turkish cuisine make it an ideal destination. The possibilities are endless swimming in the bay where Cleopatra once bathed lying back and enjoying the sun exploring the mysterious sea caves on a blue cruise or soaking in the rich heritage of Mediterranean civilisations the accumulation of millennia are only some of them. It is not exactly known when Alanya situated on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey was first settled. However the exploration made in the Kadıini Cave 12 kilometres from the centre suggests that the human history of the region dates back to the Palaeolithic Age. The earliest known name of the settlement was Coracesium. As early as the 4th century BC Alanya under the Persian control exported honey and wine to Egypt. In 197 BC the city thanks to its strong defensive walls successfully resisted an attack by King Antiochus III. The pirate Diodotus Tryphon began using Alanya as a safe harbour by 137 BC and the city rapidly became a hub for Cilician sea-bandits. The Roman Commander Pompeius brought an end to the piratical activity in the region with his victorious sea battle in 67 BC. Following this war the region was incorporated into the Roman Empire and the Roman General Mark Antony later rendered it as a gift to Cleopatra the Queen of Egypt. During antiquity the city passed between the control of neighbouring Cilicia and Pamphylia and during the 7th and 8th centuries AD successive wars and economic stagnation caused the city to shrink. The Seljuk Period brought the history of Alanya to its zenith. In 1221 the Seljuk Sultan Alaaddin Keykubat made Alanya his winter residence and rebuilt the city and Alanya became the main base of the Seljuk navy. In this period defensive walls were also renovated and Kızılkule Red Tower and Tersane Dockyard were constructed. During the reign of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror in 1471 Alanya was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and between the 13th and 18th centuries it prospered as an important port for maritime trading with Egypt Syria and Cyprus. In 1935 Atatürk visited the city and renamed it as Alanya. In our time Alanya is one of the prominent tourist destinations of the Mediterranean offering a rich historical and cultural heritage and modern facilities enabling the easy enjoyment of sun sand and sea.

The people who call Tohoku home understand the value of a moment and the preciousness of life. Journeys to this less-frequented part of Japan – where Tokyos fast pace and urban sprawl seems worlds away – offer the adventurer the opportunity to wander amongst breathtaking natural beauty and historical sites to sample traditional ways of living in ancient Japanese villages and to deepen their spirituality and experience the kindness of strangers. These are just some of the reasons that Tohoku was voted a top region in Lonely Planets Best in Travel 2020. Chūson-ji in Hiraizumi © Amana Images Inc / Getty Images Samurai treasures Originally home to the indigenous Emishi people Tohoku has a long feudal history. It was settled by various samurai clans between the 7th and 9th centuries much later than in central and southwestern Japan. Established in 1620 by Ashina Yoshikatsu the lord of the Satake clan the buke-yashiki in Kakunodate is arguably the countrys best-preserved samurai district. Many of its beautiful traditional buildings now house museums recalling life in feudal times whilst others have open doors and are free for visitors to wander about. The main street of the district is lined with ancient cherry trees which make for a spectacular sight in hanami cherry-blossom viewing season have your camera at the ready. The town of Hiraizumi in Iwate prefecture was Tohokus first Unesco World Cultural Heritage listing and is famed for its handsome historic architecture courtesy of the gold-mining Fujiwara clan who ruled here in the 12th century. Hiraizumis main attraction is the Chūson-ji temple complex which once housed over 300 buildings including 40 separate temples. The complex was ravaged by fire in 1337 but two of its original buildings survive. In Fukushima prefecture the sprawling township of Aizu-Wakamatsu was once a feudal capital and its sights including a number of famous sake breweries are dotted around town. Must-sees are the Aizu buke-yashiki and the curiously crooked Sazae-do temple building. The mountain village of Risshaku-ji Yamadera © Sean Pavone / Getty Images The mythical and the magical Tohoku is also a place of myth and legend with a long spiritual tradition. Its where youll find the sacred land of Dewa Sanzan. According to in the Shugendō folk religion Dewa Sanzan’s three peaks – Mt Haguro Mt Gassan and Mt Yudono – represent birth death and rebirth respectively. Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims flock here to journey with the yamabushi mountain priests along the well-trodden trail traversing the three mountains. Why not join them? Not far away you’ll find the village of Risshaku-ji Yamadera immortalised by the itinerant Haiku master Matsuo Bashō in his classic The Narrow Road to the Deep North. It is well worth climbing the 1000 stone steps to the top of the temple for stunning views and if you realise along the path that its all about the journey and not the destination youll be one step closer to attaining enlightenment. On the Shimokita Peninsula almost at the very tip of Japans main island Honshū youll find the hauntingly beautiful Osorezan-bodaiji temple honouring Jizō Bosatsu protector of children and a much-loved deity in Japanese mythology. After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami the temple became a place of healing and hope for many families. Visit with an open heart and mind and you will be moved by its beauty sadness and serenity. The Tōno Valley has long been a place of myth and legend made famous by writer Yanagita Kunios classic Legends of Tōno one of many records of many local stories about yokai ghost and spirits including the legendary kappa water imp. When in town be sure to venture up to the mysterious Gohyaku Rakan or increase your chances of finding true love at the Unedori Sama shrine. Beautiful Lake Towada in Towada-Hachimantai National Park © Photos from Japan / Getty Images Spectacular nature As one of the least densely populated areas of Japan Tohoku is known for its mountainous terrain. Here youll never be far from its volcanic peaks and dense forests. In the warmer months visitors to the Towada-ko Lake Towada region located within the Towada-Hachimantai National Park are rewarded with beautiful vistas and the chance to spend time on the chilly crystal clear waters. But the areas best-known attraction is Matsushima a stunning collection of hundreds of wind and sea-battered islands. Sublime onsen If you consider yourself an onsen aficionado visits to Tohokus more unique and remote mountain hot springs should be considered a high priority. Whilst it might take a little more effort to get here youll never forget that night you spent soaking your troubles away beneath a carpet of stars or retreating to your antique room refreshed and ready to dine on a sumptuous kaiseki banquet of local cuisine. In the hills above Tazawa-ko Lake Tazawa at the end of a mountain road youll find Nyūto Onsen a small selection of exceptional onsen that offer indoor outdoor and mixed bathing. Plan to overnight at one of the tranquil ryōkan traditional Japanese inn here. Eight onsen can be visited on a day-pass. Plopped in the middle of the Hakkōda-san Mt Hakkoda section of the Towada-Hachimantai National Park in Aomori prefecture youll find Sukayu Onsen famed as one of Japans best traditional baths. The water is hot and acidic and the bathing mixed housed within a creaky wooden bathhouse that has endured scores of lonely frigid winters. Colourful streamers at Sendai Tanabata Matsuri © MOCCABUNNY / Getty Images Unforgettable festivals The people of Tohoku celebrate a multitude of proud traditions dating hundreds of years almost all of which culminate in some of Japans most rousing summer celebrations. One of the biggest festivals in the region Sendai Tanabata Matsuri drapes the city in thousands of colourful streamers and paper decorations to celebrate an old Chinese legend. In the legend two stars Vega and Altair fall in love but their love was not destined to be. Aomori Neputa Matsuri and Hirosaki Neputa Matsuri both feature elaborate illuminated floats paraded through the streets to the accompaniment of taiko drums and traditional song and dance. Equally mesmerizing Akita Kantō Matsuri sees hundreds of townsfolk balancing beautiful illuminated lanterns on giant poles as they parade through the city streets to the beat of taiko drumming groups.

Entrance to the Prado is via the eastern Puerta de los Jerónimos with tickets on sale beneath the northern Puerta de Goya. Once inside pick up the free plan from the ticket office or information desk just inside the entrance – it lists the locations of 50 of the Prado’s most famous works and gives room numbers for all major artists. History The western wing of the Prado Edificio Villanueva was completed in 1785 as the neoclassical Palacio de Villanueva. Originally conceived as a house of science it later served somewhat ignominiously as a cavalry barracks for Napoleon’s troops during their occupation of Madrid between 1808 and 1813. In 1814 King Fernando VII decided to use the palace as a museum although his purpose was more about finding a way of storing the hundreds of royal paintings gathering dust than any high-minded civic ideals – this was an era where art was a royal preserve. Five years later the Museo del Prado opened with 311 Spanish paintings on display. Goya Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes Goya is found on all three floors of the Prado but we recommend starting at the southern end of the ground or lower level. In Rooms 64 and 65 Goya’s El dos de mayo and El tres de mayo rank among Madrid’s most emblematic paintings they bring to life the 1808 anti-French revolt and subsequent execution of insurgents in Madrid. Alongside in Rooms 66 and 67 are some of his darkest and most disturbing works Pinturas negras they are so called in part because of the dark browns and black that dominate but more for the distorted animalesque appearance of their characters. There are more Goyas on the 1st floor in Rooms 34 to 37. Among them are two more of Goya’s best-known and most intriguing oils La maja vestida and La maja desnuda. These portraits in Room 37 of an unknown woman commonly believed to be the Duquesa de Alba who may have been Goya’s lover are identical save for the lack of clothing in the latter. There are further Goyas on the top floor. Velázquez Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velázquez Velázquez is another of the grand masters of Spanish art who brings so much distinction to the Prado. Of all his works Las meninas Room 12 is what most people come to see. Completed in 1656 it is more properly known as La família de Felipe IV The Family of Felipe IV. The rooms surrounding Las meninas contain more fine works by Velázquez watch in particular for his paintings of various members of royalty who seem to spring off the canvas – Felipe II Felipe IV Margarita de Austria a younger version of whom features in Las meninas El Príncipe Baltasar Carlos and Isabel de Francia – on horseback. Spanish & Other European Masters Having experienced the essence of the Prado you’re now free to select from the astonishingly diverse works that remain. If Spanish painters have piqued your curiosity Bartolomé Esteban Murillo José de Ribera and the stark figures of Francisco de Zurbarán should be on your itinerary. The vivid almost surreal works by the 16th-century master and adopted Spaniard El Greco whose figures are characteristically slender and tortured are also perfectly executed. Another alternative is the Prado’s outstanding collection of Flemish art. The fulsome figures and bulbous cherubs of Peter Paul Rubens 1577–1640 provide a playful antidote to the darkness of many of the other Flemish artists. His signature works are Las tres gracias The Three Graces and Adoración de los reyes magos. Other fine works in the vicinity include The Triumph of Death by Pieter Bruegel Rembrandt’s Artemisa and those by Anton Van Dyck. And on no account miss the weird and wonderful The Garden of Earthly Delights Room 56A by Hieronymus Bosch c 1450–1516. No one has yet been able to provide a definitive explanation for this hallucinatory work although many have tried. And then there are the paintings by Dürer Rafael Tiziano Titian Tintoretto Sorolla Gainsborough Fra Angelico Tiepolo… Edificio Jerónimos In contrast to the original Edificio Villanueva the eastern wing Edificio Jerónimos is part of the Prado’s stunning modern extension which opened in 2007. Dedicated to temporary exhibitions usually to display Prado masterpieces held in storage for decades for lack of wall space and home to the excellent bookshop and cafe its main attraction is the 2nd-floor cloisters. Built in 1672 with local granite the cloisters were until recently attached to the adjacent Iglesia de San Jerónimo El Real but were in a parlous state. As part of their controversial incorporation into the Prado they were painstakingly dismantled restored and reassembled.

The current version was designed by Francesco Sabatini who also designed the Puerta de Alcalá and finished off the Palacio Real. He designed the church with an unusual floor plan the nave is circular and surrounded by chapels guarded by imposing marble statues of the 12 apostles 12 prophets rendered in wood sit above them at the base of the dome. Each of the chapels is adorned with frescoes and decorated according to a different historical style but most people rush to the neo-plateresque Capilla de San Bernardino where the central fresco was painted by Goya in the early stages of his career. Unusually Goya has painted himself into the scene he’s the one in the yellow shirt on the right. A series of corridors behind the high altar accessible only as part of the guided visit is lined with works of art from the 17th to 19th centuries highlights include a painting by Francisco Zurbarán and another by Francisco Pacheco the father-in-law and teacher of Velázquez. In the sacristy watch out for the fine Renaissance sillería the sculpted walnut seats where the church’s superiors would meet. A word about the opening hours although entry is free during morning Mass times there is no access to the museum and the lights in the Capilla de San Bernardino won’t be on to illuminate the Goya. At all other times visit is by Spanish-language guided tour included in the admission price. Just to confuse matters you may face a similar problem if you’re here on a Friday afternoon or any time Saturday if there’s a wedding taking place.

The fine Museo Taurino is also here and the architecture will be of interest even to those with no interest in las corridas bullfights. Bullfights are still held regularly here during the season which runs roughly mid-May to September.

It was opened in 1931 and hosted its first fight three years later its four storeys can seat 25000 spectators. Like all bullrings it evokes more a sense of a theatre than a sports stadium. It also hosts concerts. To be carried high on the shoulders of aficionados out through the grand and decidedly Moorish Puerta de Madrid is the ultimate dream of any torero bullfighter – if you’ve made it at Las Ventas you’ve reached the pinnacle of the bullfighting world. The gate is suitably known more colloquially as the ‘Gate of Glory’. Guided visits in English and Spanish take you out onto the sand and into the royal box tours must be booked in advance through Las Ventas Tour. The recently renovated Museo Taurino contains a new space dedicated to bullfighting legend Manolete as well as a curious collection of paraphernalia costumes the traje de luces or suit of lights is one of bullfighting’s most recognisable props photos and other bullfighting memorabilia up on the top floor above one of the two courtyards by the ring. Its a fascinating insight into the whole subculture that surrounds bullfighting. The area where the Plaza de Toros is located is known as Las Ventas because in times gone by several wayside taverns ventas along with houses of ill repute were to be found here.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1db,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/edirne,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Edirne Home of Oil Wrestling HomeDestinationsEdirne Located north of Tekirdağ Edirne Adrianople was the Ottoman capital for many years. The 16th-century Selimiye Mosque built by architect Mimar Sinan is considered an Ottoman classic and can be found in the city centre. In the 18th century it was one of the seven largest cities in Europe. Set on a verdant plain of poplar trees near the junction of the Tunca and Meriç rivers this gracefully historical city welcomes visitors as they make their way to İstanbul and other points east. The people of Edirne trace their origins back to the rule of the Macedonians. The Roman Emperor Hadrian rebuilt the city and renamed it Hadrianople after himself. With the division of the Roman Empire the Byzantines claimed Edirne. In 1361 Sultan Murat I added it to his empire. The citys role as the capital of the Ottoman Empire for almost 100 years accounts for its many historically and architecturally important buildings. With its mosques religious complexes bridges old bazaars caravanserais and palaces Edirne is a living museum. Edirne has retained many of its colourful traditions and customs. Enchanting Mosques The Eski Mosque is the oldest Ottoman structure in Edirne and built by Mehmet I between 1403 and 1414. The white marble of its portal contrasts with the buildings cut stone and brick masonry while calligraphic inscriptions of Koranic verses decorate the interior. The Üç Şerefeli Mosque built by Murat I between 1438 and 1447 presages Sinans great mosque architecture and embodies a new freedom from restraint as well as advances in engineering. The northwest minaret has three galleries giving the mosque its name and it was the highest minaret until those of the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne eclipsed it. Towards the end of the 15th century Beyazıt II commissioned the architect Hayrettin to build him a complex in stood out in its time as being a modern hospital with a unique architectural design. Little has changed in the Kaleiçi section of Edirne since the Middle Ages with narrow streets lined with houses winding through the area. The number of small restaurants and cafes reflect the districts current renaissance. Sinan built several of the famous baths in Edirne including the Sokollu Tahtakale Mezit Bey Beylerbeyi and Gazi Mihal hamams. His work is also seen at the Ahmet Paşa Caravanserai and the Rüstem Paşa Caravanserai of 1561 – the latter was renovated and today it serves as a charming hotel. The old bedesten of the early 15th century still functions as Edirnes main market. As you drive around the area you will spot many lovely Ottoman bridges gracing the Tunca and Meriç rivers. Colourful Traditions Edirne has retained many of its colourful traditions and customs. Every summer the Kırkpınar oil wrestling contests are held at an emerald green meadow in Sarayiçi. Shiny slippery bodies grapple with each other to decide on the champion wrestler. As you walk through the city and peer into the corners of the grocery stores you see blocks of white feta cheese a local specialty. Hardaliye another of the city’s delicacies is a grape drink mixed with mustard and marzipan. Scented soaps earthenware pots and straw baskets from Edirne make good souvenirs. You will also find it difficult to resist the beautiful embroidery work of the local women. The Archaeology and Ethnography Museum traces the history of the area from prehistoric to Byzantine times and exhibits clothing from the late Ottoman period. At the Turkish Islamic Art Museum examples of Ottoman architectural details calligraphy manuscripts Korans weapons glass and an imperial tent used on military campaigns are on display. The Selimiye Mosque in its entire splendour is visible from all parts of Edirne. Selimiye Mosque and its Social Complex The Selimiye Mosque and its Külliye form a complex including a madrasah or Islamic religious academy dar-ül hadis hadith school timekeeper’s room and an arasta avenue of shops. Constructed by the celebrated architect Sinan between 1569 and 1575 the Selimiye Mosque and its complex are located in Edirne the capital of Ottoman Empire before İstanbul. A masterpiece of Ottoman art and in the history of world architecture the Selimiye Mosque is visible from all parts of the city with its monumental dome and four slender minarets. Besides its unique architectural characteristics the mosque evokes admiration with its exquisite details in its carved-stone work and marble glazed tiles wood carving and mother-of-pearl inlays. Much More On the way to the Saroz Gulf in the Aegean Sea you can stop at Uzunköprü to see an interesting bridge built by Murat II in 1444 spanning the Ergene River. Its 174 arches make up its 1392-m length. The mild climate and beautiful surroundings of the Saroz Gulf invite holidaymakers for a relaxing break. On the northern edge of the gulf are the lovely İbrice and Erikli beaches where hotel and guest-house facilities are plentiful and reasonably priced. Enez Ainos was an important port in ancient times but today it lies 3.5 km inland. Its origins can be traced to the 12th century BC. It was also an important settlement during the Hellenic Roman Byzantine and Ottoman periods. First built by the Kyme people it was a colony of western Anatolian civilization though these days it is an open-air museum. Enez Castle has been restored several times throughout history and is well worth a visit. There is also a church dating from the 6th century some carved tombs and a beach with clear water.

The world’s largest Gothic cathedral it was built between 1434 and 1517 over the remains of what had previously been the city’s main mosque. Highlights include the Giralda the mighty bell tower which incorporates the mosque’s original minaret the monumental tomb of Christopher Columbus and the Capilla Mayor with an astonishing gold altarpiece.

The history of the cathedral goes back to the 15th century but the history of Christian worship on the site dates to the mid-13th century. In 1248 the Castilian king Fernando III captured Seville from its Almohad rulers and transformed their great 12th-century mosque into a church. Some 153 years later in 1401 the city’s ecclesiastical authorities decided to replace the former mosque which had been damaged by an earthquake in 1356 with a spectacular new cathedral Lets construct a church so large future generations will think we were mad they quipped or so legend has it. The result is the staggering cathedral you see today officially known as the Catedral de Santa María de la Sede. It’s one of the world’s largest churches and a veritable treasure trove of art with notable works by Zurbarán Murillo Goya and others. Exterior With its immense flying buttresses and Gothic embellishments the cathedrals exterior provides a suitably dramatic shell for the treasures within. Pause to look at the Puerta del Perdón now the cathedrals exit on Calle Alemanes which is one of the few remaining elements of the original mosque. Sala del Pabellón Selected treasures from the cathedral’s art collection are exhibited in this room the first after the ticket office. Much of what’s displayed here as elsewhere in the cathedral is the work of masters from Seville’s 17th-century Golden Age. Tomb of Christopher Columbus Once inside the cathedral proper head right until you come to the tomb of Christopher Columbus the Sepulcro de Cristóbal Colón in front of the Puerta del Príncipe Door of the Prince. The monument supposedly contains the remains of the great explorer but debate continues as to whether the bones are actually his. Columbus’ remains were moved many times after his death in 1506 in Valladolid northern Spain and there are those who claim his real bones lie in Santo Domingo. Certainly his bones spent time in the Dominican Republic after they were shipped to Spanish-controlled Hispaniola from their original resting place the Monasterio de la Cartuja in 1537. However they were later sent to Havana and returned to Seville in 1898. DNA testing in 2006 proved a match between the bones supposed to be Columbus and bones known to be from his brother Diego. And while that didn’t conclusively solve the mystery it strongly suggested that the great man really is interred in the tomb that bears his name. Sacristía de los Cálices To the right of Columbus tomb are a series of rooms containing some of the cathedral’s greatest masterpieces. First up is the Sacristy of the Chalices behind the Capilla de los Dolores where Francisco de Goya’s painting of the Sevillan martyrs Santas Justa y Rufina 1817 hangs above the altar. Sacristía Mayor Next along is this large room with a finely carved stone cupola created between 1528 and 1547. Pedro de Campaña’s 1547 El descendimiento Descent from the Cross above the central altar at the southern end and Francisco de Zurbarán’s Santa Teresa to its right are two of the cathedral’s most precious paintings. Also look out for the Custodia de Juan de Arfe a huge 475kg silver monstrance made in the 1580s by Renaissance metal smith Juan de Arfe. Sala Capitular The circular chapter house also called the Cabildo features a stunning carved dome and a Murillo masterpiece La inmaculada set high above the archbishop’s throne. The room whose design was inspired by Michelangelos Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome was built between 1558 and 1592 as a venue for meetings of the cathedral hierarchy. Also impressive is the Antecabildo with its decorated vaulted ceiling. Capilla Mayor Even in a church as spectacular as this the Capilla Mayor Main Chapel stands out with its astonishing Gothic retable reckoned to be the worlds largest altarpiece. Begun by Flemish sculptor Pieter Dancart in 1482 and finished by others in 1564 this sea of gilt and polychromed wood holds more than 1000 carved biblical figures. At the centre of the lowest level is a tiny 13th-century silver-plated cedar image of the Virgen de la sede Virgin of the See patron of the cathedral. Coro West of the Capilla Mayor and dominating the central nave is the 16th-century Coro Choir. This giant box-like structure incorporates 114 elaborately wooden seats in Gothic-Mudéjar style and a vast organ. Capilla de San Antonio The chapels along the sides of the cathedral hold yet more artistic treasures. Of particular note is the Capilla de San Antonio at the western end of the northern aisle housing Murillo’s gigantic 1656 depiction of the Visión de San Antonio de Padua Vision of St Anthony of Padua. The painting was victim of a daring art heist in 1874. Giralda In the northeastern corner of the cathedral you’ll find the entry to the Giralda. The climb to the top involves walking up 35 ramps built so that the guards could ride up on horseback and a small flight of stairs at the top. Your reward is sensational rooftop views. The decorative brick tower which tops out at 104m was the minaret of the mosque constructed between 1184 and 1198 at the height of Almohad power. Its proportions delicate brick-pattern decoration and colour which changes with the light make it perhaps Spain’s most perfect Islamic building. The topmost parts – from bell level up – were added in the 16th century when Spanish Christians were busy ‘improving on’ surviving Islamic buildings. At the very top is El Giraldillo a 16th-century bronze weather vane representing ‘faith that has become a symbol of Seville. Patio de los Naranjos Outside the cathedral’s northern flank this patio was originally the mosques main courtyard. It’s planted with 66 naranjos orange trees and has a small Visigothic fountain in the centre. Look out for a stuffed crocodile hanging over the courtyards doorway – its a replica of a gift the Sultan of Egypt gave Alfonso X in around 1260.

It is dominated by the 52m-high Nelsons Column guarded by four bronze lion statues and ringed by many splendid buildings including the National Gallery and the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields.

The Fourth Plinth originally intended for a statue of King William IV remained empty for 150 years because of a lack of funds. Since 1999 the fourth plinth has been the stage for modern sculpture each remains in place for 18 months. In March 2020 the 13th piece was revealed. By the British artist Heather Phillipson known for her video works and sculptural installations the piece -- a giant unstable dollop of whipped cream topped with a cherry a fly and a drone which is apparently filming onlookers -- is titled The End. The work comments on congregation and surveillance with the top-heavy sculpture inviting the notion of impending collapse -- a theme that is echoed by the works rather apocalyptic title. Nearby the much-overlooked if not quite ignored brass plaques recording the precise length of imperial units – including the inch foot and yard – are set into the stonework to the left of the steps as you walk down from the National Gallery. All distances to London are measured from another plaque at the foot of the statue of King Charles II on horseback located on a traffic island south of Nelsons Column. Fountains were included in the squares designs to reduce the number of people who gather in the area and to deter riots. If anything got out of hand a small police box with a direct line to Scotland Yard and narrow windows to view the whole square was built in the southeast corner and is often called Londons smallest police station.

Metéora is one of Christianity’s holiest places as well as a landscape of outstanding natural beauty. Thousands of visitors flock to this place every year attracted by the daunting size of the rock formations where timelessness and beauty prevail while they seek spiritual enlightenment far away from the earthly bustle. The stone forest” of Meteora is a perfect combination of natural and manmade landscape practically inducing a sense of the transcendent. Visitors come here either to feel the aura of the contemplative seclusion of monastic life and admire a truly unique natural landscape or to marvel at the outstanding architecture of the monasteries the so-called architecture of awe”. Metéora is the second largest monastic and pilgrimage area in Greece after Mount Athos. The first monks took refuge on these cliff tops fleeing an invading Turkish army around the 11th century. Several monasteries were built in the centuries that followed and all the building materials had to be winched up in baskets. Until 1920 this was the sole means for getting supplies up to the monasteries. According to numerous historical sources there were once thirty religious communities but today only six of them remain and can be visited other smaller monasteries mostly built during the 14th century are now deserted. In the past monks had to climb steep rocks to reach the monasteries but today you can follow the steps cut into the rock or ride up a special cable car. Action enthusiasts however should opt for climbing the ideal way to get an adrenaline rush and enjoy the uniqueness of the landscape in the most exciting way! Nature lovers should not miss the opportunity to hike through winding stone paths and gaze at a unique geological phenomenon formed as a result of a chain of erosions and geological changes over a period of 15 million years. In 1988 Metéora was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1e5,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/izmir,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU İzmir Pearl of the Aegean HomeDestinationsİzmir The beautiful İzmir pulls you into a world of picturesque modernity and traditions with its refreshing touches to the human souls. İzmir is the ancient city of Smyrna or the country of the sacred mother which existed even before the arrival of the Hittites and was ruled by Ionians Persians Romans and Ottomans. The original city was established in the third millennium BC at present day Bayraklı and had the most advanced culture alongside Troy in Western Anatolia. Excavations at Bayraklı have unearthed a temple dedicated to Athena and the wall of the Ionian city which had flourished there between the seventh and fifth centuries BC. Pottery dating back to the third millennium BC has also been uncovered. By 1500BC it had fallen under the influence of the Central Anatolian Hittite Empire. İzmir mesmerizes visitors in an aura of history and modernity. During the first millennium BC İzmir known then as Smyrna ranked as one of the most important cities of the Ionian Federation and Homer is believed to have lived here during this period. The Lydian conquest of the city around 600BC brought this period to an end. İzmir remained little more than a village throughout Lydian rule and the sixth century BC Persian rule. During the fourth century BC a new city was built on the slopes of Mt Pagos Kadifekale during the reign of Alexander the Great. İzmirs Roman period beginning in the first century BC was its second great era. Byzantine rule followed in the fourth century and lasted until the Seljuk conquest of the 11th century. In 1415 under Sultan Mehmet Çelebi İzmir became part of the Ottoman Empire. Welcome to İzmir of Modern Times! Today İzmir is one of Turkeys most pleasant cities its streets are shaded by palm trees the sideways are beautiful and the houses elegant. As the final destination of the Kings Road which goes all the way to Iran İzmir continues to be a focal point for tourism and entertainment. The citys coastline is renowned for its fish restaurants along the coast as well as its bars discos and nightclubs whereas its hinterlands are rich in monuments and ruins which tell the tale of countless ancient civilizations. Also highly valued since ancient times the Balçova Springs are found just 10km west of İzmir. Must-see sights On arrival in İzmir there are many must-see sights such as the Church of St Polycarp one of the seven churches mentioned in Bible. The Archaeological Museum near Konak Square houses a superb collection of antiquities including the statues of Poseidon and Demeter which in ancient times stood in the Agora. Next to the Archaeological Museum is the Ethnography Museum which displays a fine collection of Bergama and Gördes carpets traditional costumes and camel bridles. On Kadifekale Mt Pagos stands the impressive ruins of a castle and its walls which were built by Lysimachus under the reign of Alexander the Great. They still dominate İzmir today. The castle offers an excellent vantage point from where to enjoy a magnificent view of the Gulf of İzmir. The Agora or marketplace in the Namazgah quarter was constructed during the rule of Alexander the Great what remains today however dates from the rebuilding under Marcus Aurelius after a devastating earthquake in 178 AD. Built in the 16th century and restored in the 19th Hisar Mosque is the largest and oldest mosque in İzmir. In the village of Birgi the Çakır Ağa Mansion is a fine example of traditional Turkish architecture. Nature and history are interwoven into a city design show. Şirince a peaceful village nestled in greenery has a long history just as the other settlements around do. You can enjoy local tastes and visit the houses dating from the Ottoman Period that stretch along narrow streets with stone pavements. As an original Aegean settlement with many other unique characteristics Şirince Village deserves a visit. Ephesus A Monument for All Time The ancient city of Ephesus is Turkey’s most important ancient city and one of the best preserved and restored. One can still stroll for hours along its streets passing temples theatres libraries houses and statues. It contains such grand public buildings as the impressive Library of Celsus the theatre the Temple of Hadrian and the sumptuous Temple of Artemis which is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The ruins also include public toilets and even a brothel dating mostly from the fourth century BC. Ephesus is particularly important for faith tourism as it contains the House of the Virgin Mary. It is believed that the Virgin Mary was taken to this stone house by St John where she lived until her death at the age of 101. The Church of the Virgin Mary close to the original harbour of Ephesus was the setting for the Third Ecumenical Council in 431. Two other religious sites worth visiting are the Basilica of St John built in the sixth century and İsa Bey Mosque which is a sample of Seljuk architecture. Ephesus is not just a touristic site. It is home to the International İzmir Festival utilizing its grand amphitheatre Celsus Library and the House of the Virgin Mary. Ephesus As one of the most important centres of the ancient era that is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015 Ephesus had been inhabited approximately for 9000 years throughout the Hellenistic Era Roman Period Byzantine Era the Period of Principalities and the Ottoman Era. It was a very important port city and centre of culture and commerce.

It is difficult today to imagine the excitement of Schliemann and Dörpfeld who with Homer as their guide revealed one of the greatest cradles of humankind before the eyes of the whole world. The Mycenaean civilisation held dominion over this land which was inhabited continuously since the dawn of history and it became the leading light of the ancient known world. Mycenae – the city of the legendary Agamemnon Homer and other writers of ancient Greek tragedy committed their names to memories which have passed into the collective unconscious of humanity. Agamemnon and Menelaus Danaë and Perseus Pelops and Atreus are the apparent forefathers of all of Europe and the birthplace of all of these historical figures is golden Mycenae. The earliest archaeological fragments indicate that the site of Mycenae was inhabited since the 7th millennium BC from prehistoric times. In a dominant naturally fortified position between the tranquil sloping hills of Profitis Ilias and Sara with a plentiful water supply it was an ideal place for man to settle and live a protected life. The apogee of the Mycenaeans with their majestic architecture inscribed monuments and sophisticated civilisation occurred in the Late Bronze Age between 1350 and 1200 BC. The first hegemonic factions appeared as early as 1700 BC that is in an historical period for which is difficult to determine exact details. But around this same period construction began on the first monumental tombs. After this expansion developed at a dizzying speed. Palatial complexes Cyclopean masonry which is awe-inspiring even today the famous Tomb of Agamemnon” also known as the Treasury of Atreus” huge arches fountains and ramparts comprise one of the greatest architectural complexes known to the ancient world. The decline of Mycenae occurred around 1100 BC possibly due to repeated damage from earthquakes and fires. They had managed however to have once been a truly great empire which has indelibly stamped its reputation on the history not only of Greece but the entire world. The archaeological site of Mycenae is 140km from Athens and 24km from Nafplio. Tiryns – a city built by the Cyclopes The fortification of the hill of Tiryns 8km from Argos which protects the palace complex is such an impressive construction that the ancient Greeks could not believe that it was built by human hands. Thus the architects of Tiryns were said to be the Cyclopes who came to the city with Proetus its legendary founder from distant Lycia. All the great heroes with supernatural powers are associated with Tiryns Bellerophon Perseus and Hercules. Indeed the construction of the wall is unbelievable and a challenge to logic even for today’s visitors. One stands in awe in front of the perfect assembly of these huge boulders unable to understand either how or who could have performed such a great feat of engineering. From archaeological findings we know that the gently sloping hill of Tiryns was continuously inhabited from Neolithic times to Late Antiquity. It was already flourishing in the Early Bronze Age. Between 2700 and 2200 BC there was a populous and prosperous city here. The circular building 27 metres in diameter which dominates the hilltop bears witness to the undeniable power of the city. The fortifications of Tiryns were completed in stages to protect the palace complex their places of worship and burial sites. Warehouses workshops and houses complete the picture of a city which flourished for almost 2000 years until the 5th century BC. Becoming familiar with Mycenaean civilisation involves a descent into the deepest reaches of human history. Looking at Mycenae and Tiryns one loses all sense of time. Legend and history intertwine in a dreamlike motif. The gods already memorialized by name in the Mycenaean syllabic inscriptions seem somehow familiar. The heroes still walk the citadel of Mycenae guardians of a past gone but not forgotten. connect and experience Download Banners Download Wallpapers Download Guides Download Brochures Download Maps Download Photos Sign up to our newsletter explore Greece by interest Culture Leisure Touring Gastronomy Activities Religious Meetings City Break useful info Sea Routes A.I.A.

As the royal fine arts academy it has nurtured local talent thereby complementing the royal penchant for drawing the great international artists of the day into their realm. The pantheon of former alumni reads like a who’s who of Spanish art and the collection that now hangs on the academy’s walls is a suitably rich one. Tickets & tours Bike Route around Maspalomas & visit to San Fernandos Market with Tapas £60.36 and up Details Segway Tour Real Sitio de San Ildefonso Segovia 2h £52.49 and up Details Real Madrids Bernabeu Bike tour £53.76 and up Details More tickets & tours Details Calle de Alcalá 13 91 524 08 64 Visit website Hours10am-3pm Tue-Sun Sep-Jul Priceadult/child €8/free Wed free In any other city this gallery would be a standout attraction but in Madrid it often gets forgotten in the rush to the Prado Thyssen-Bornemisza or Reina Sofía. Nonetheless a visit here is a fascinating journey into another age of art when we tell you that Picasso and Dalí studied at this academy long the academic centre of learning for up-and-coming artists but found it far too stuffy for their liking you’ll get an idea of what to expect. A centre of excellence since Fernando VI founded the academy in the 18th century it remains a stunning repository of works by some of the best-loved old masters. The 1st floor mainly devoted to 16th- to 19th-century paintings is the most noteworthy of those in the academic gallery. Among relative unknowns you come across a hall of works by Zurbarán especially arresting is the series of full-length portraits of white-cloaked friars and a San Jerónimo by El Greco. At a ‘fork’ in the exhibition a sign points right to rooms 11 to 16 the main one showcasing Alonso Cano 1601–67 and José de Ribera 1591–1652. In the others a couple of minor portraits by Velázquez hang alongside the occasional Rubens Tintoretto and Bellini which have somehow been smuggled in. Rooms 17 to 22 offer a space full of Bravo Murillo and last but most captivating 13 pieces by Goya including self-portraits portraits of King Fernando VII and the infamous minister Manuel Godoy along with one on bullfighting. The 19th and 20th centuries are the themes upstairs. It’s not the most extensive or engaging modern collection but you’ll find drawings by Picasso as well as works by Joaquín Sorolla Juan Gris Eduardo Chillida and Ignacio Zuloaga in most cases with only one or two items each.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1e9,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/hattusas,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Hattuşaş The Capital Standing the Test of Time HomeDestinationsHattuşaş Lying within the great loop of the Kızılırmak red river these ancient ruins are what’s left standing of the Hittite Empire from the Bronze age. Located within the boundaries of Boğazkale District southwest of Çorum Hattusas had served as the capital of the Hittite Empire for 450 years between 1650-1200 BC extending over a 180-hectare rough and rocky terrain. During the Hittite Empire this magnificent city used to be surrounded by 6 kilometers long city walls with high towers at certain intervals. The monumental gateways through these walls made entries and exits possible at old times. Such gates as Aslanlı Kapı which has lion statues on it- so to say the Lions Gate the Sphinx Gate and the Royal Gate are decorated with reliefs indicating a high talent and taste of delicate stonemasonry. At the farthest southern point of the city the walls passes over a piled earth level considered to be the citys crown. Just beneath the Sphinx Gate standing at the central point here a potern tunnel of 71 meters was formed. The restoration works carried out there up to now with an original system has transformed the ancient capital city which still stands up against the pressure of time into an open air museum. Nation of One Thousand Gods The Hittite Empire ruled across a wide geography dominating lots of people of different origins. With this attempt seen as a political preference the gods of different communities were brought together under an official pantheon. In so doing different communities under the dominance of Hittites were made to live together under a central power. Together with their unique cultural elements the Indo-European Hittites had adopted many other cultural details of various cultures they met and found acceptable to their own while defining themselves as the Nation of One Thousand Gods. Hattusas was not only the administrative capital but also the religious centre of the whole Empire. As one of the leading 31 temples of Hittites the Great Temple Büyük Mabet was the place wherein they worshipped two gods they considered as the most powerful- Storm God of Hatti and the Sun Goddess of the Arinna City. As the most impressive centre of divinity Yazılıkaya Open Air Shrine was especially used for the new year celebrations during spring months. The leading gods and goddesses inscribed in series onto rocks best reflect the religious diversity of the Hittites. Since the lands of Anatolia being the passageways between the East and the West were under the control of Hittites the mythological stories created by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia were first carried to Hittities from Hurrians. And then Hittites took them further and transported them to the Ancient Greek Civilization. Hattuşaş on UNESCOs World Heritage List Hattusas was inscribed to the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1986. Some of the reasons why Hatussas was added to the World Heritage List of UNESCO are as follows Hattusas represents a matchless artistic success with its ruins as well as with the Lions Gate the Royal Gate and Yazılıkaya Open Air ShrineCC Hattusas established a strong dominance over Anatolian and Northern Syrian civilizations in the first and second millennia BCCC As a political and religious capital it displayed a comprehensive appearance with palaces temples trade centres and suchCC Hattusas was the sole witness of the collapse of the Hittite Civilization and last but not least this ancient capital has perfectly preserved some groups of structural and architectural artworks such as Kings Palace temples and some other building foundations. Furthermore the cuneiform tablet archives of Hattusas that symbolize the oldest recorded Indo-European language became involved in UNESCOs Memory of World Register in 2001. And so Hattusas still enjoys the privilege to be the first and for now the last asset placed in both cruical lists of UNESCO. How to Go? Hattusas is situated in Boğazkale District of Çorum Province. It is located 87 kilometer to the southwest of Çorum. It is 220 km from Ankara and 215 km from Ankara Esenboğa Airport whereas the distance from Merzifon Airport is 150 km.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1ed,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/antalya,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Antalya The Tourism Capital HomeDestinationsAntalya With ancient cities hidden among forests with oxygen-rich air Antalya is a holiday paradise offering much more than one might expect. Antalya was founded in 158-138 BC by Attalus II King of Pergamon who named the city Attaleia after himself. Having been inhabited continuously since then it was encircled by strong protective walls in Roman times. The Byzantines and Seljuks successively occupied the city before it came under Ottoman rule. Antalya is situated at the end of a gulf the namesake of the city and extends over a green plateau that lies parallel to the sea. With its blue sea luminous sky the ever-changing colour of its mountains and lush green vegetation the city is a festival of colours. Today it is one of the worlds best-loved tourist resorts with numerous five-star hotels holiday villages and entertainment establishments. Besides the chances Antalya offers for skiing on the mountains and then descending to the shore for a swim the proximity of a great number of archaeological sites and ruins enhances its appeal. There are great works of art from different civilizations at every corner of the city. In the picturesque old quarter of Kaleiçi narrow winding streets and old wooden houses abut the ancient city walls. When Emperor Hadrian visited Phaselis in Antalya in 130 AD a beautifully-decorated three arched gate with Corinthian columns was built into the city walls in his honour. It was the only entrance through the city walls. The two towers flanking the gate as well as other sections of the walls are standing near the marina. The clock tower in Kalekapısı Square was also part of the old city’s towers. The elegant fluted minaret of the Yivli Minaret Mosque at the centre of the city built by the Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat in the 13th century has become Antalya’s symbol. The Karatay Madrasah in the Kaleiçi district from the same period exemplifies the best of Seljuk stone carving. The two most important Ottoman mosques in the city are the 16th-century Murat Paşa Mosque remarkable for its tile decoration and the 18th-century Tekeli Mehmet Paşa Mosque. Neighbouring the marina the attractive late 19th-century İskele Mosque is built of cut stone and set on four pillars over a natural spring. The Hıdırlık Kulesi tower was probably constructed as a lighthouse in the second century. The Kesik Minaret Mosque which was previously a church bears witness to the city’s long history. The major part of the southern coastline falls within the borders of the city of Antalya. With ancient cities hidden among the trees lush-green plateaus and forests with oxygen-rich air trekking routes and beautiful beaches Antalya is a holiday paradise offering much more than one might expect. Hotspots along the coastline Visitors can also find a number of touristic hotspots along the coastline away from the city centre. Kemer 42km from Antalya through a spectacular mountain scenery is the first such spot to the west of the city. This resort town has been carefully designed to blend in with the surrounding scenery and offers an ideal environment for a wonderful holiday. The fully equipped Kemer Marina allows yachtsmen to enjoy the unspoiled bays and beaches on the south of the town. Shoppers will delight in the wonderful range of high-quality souvenirs. A beach promenade with its cafes and shops on the north of the marina leads directly to Kemer Beach which was awarded a Blue Flag. Other tourist centres to the north are Kızıltepe Göynük and Beldibi while to the south there is Çamyuva and Tekirova. At the foot of 2575m-high Mt Tahtalı Olympos 15km south of Kemer the three harbours of Phaselis were once major commercial centres. The ruins of aqueducts agoras baths a theatre Hadrians Gate and an acropolis reveal the city’s historical importance. The ancient city of Olympos is situated on the southern side of Mt Tahtalı. Oleander and laurel bushes shade the Olympos Valley accessible by land or sea. North of Olympos and up from Çıralı Beach is Yanartaş at a height of 300m where Greek mythology tells us the Lycian hero Bellerophon mounted his winged horse Pegasus and slew the fire-breathing Chimaera. The Karain Cave which dates from the Palaeolithic Age is the oldest known cave where human lived in Anatolia. A single entrance lit by the morning sun opens onto three large interconnecting chambers. Although the little museum at the entrance displays some of its finds most of the artefacts discovered are housed in museums around Turkey with some of them dating to 160000 BC. The ruins of the city of Termessos are perched on a 1050m-high plateau lying on the western slopes of Güllük Mountain Solymos within Güllük Mountain National Park that is situated to the northwest of Antalya. A wild and splendid landscape surrounds the monumental traces of this city and a nature and wildlife museum can be found at the parks entrance. Limyra an ancient Lycian city can be found 10km inland from Finike via Turunçova. Farther along this road is the Lycian city of Arykanda. It was inhabited by at least 500 BC and was destroyed several times by fire or earthquake. The ancient city of Myra now called Demre or Kale is 25km west of Finike. St Nicholas who was born in Patara was the bishop of Myra during the fourth century AD and died there in 345. The island of Kekova an hour from Çayağzı by sea gives its name to a whole group of picturesque islands numerous bays and ancient cities. Continuing west out of Kekova you come to Kaş a lovely spot surrounded by mountains on three sides. Swimming and diving are excellent in the clear cool water around Kaş. Along the scenic Kalkan road Kaputaş has a beautiful beach at one end of the Turquoise Grotto. A little distance to the west is Kalkan a lovely small hilltop town that overlooks a tiny bay. The ancient Lycian capital of Xanthos today in the village of Kınık and the Lycian cultic centre of Letoon are included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Xanthos-Letoon Xanthos was a city in ancient Lycia the site of present day Kınık although in early sources Xanthos is used synonymously for Lycia as a whole. The archaeological site of Letoon is located between the towns of Kaş and Fethiye approximately 4km south of Xanthos along the river. These sites illustrate the blending of Lycian traditions and ancient Greek influence especially in their funerary art. Archaeological experts and linguists agree that the epigraphic inscriptions are crucial for our understanding of the history of the Lycian people and their Indo-European language. Relish your eternal moment of sunbathing just after an excellent skiing experience” Enjoy two seasons on the same day Saklıkent 50km from Antalya is an ideal winter sports resort at an altitude of 1750-1900m on the northern slopes of Bakırlı Mountain.

Beautiful cascades The eastern part of Antalya is as rich as its western part. The sandy Lara Beach lies about 12km to the east.

The large and popular resort centre of Alanya lies at one end of a rocky promontory which juts out into the Mediterranean between two long sandy beaches. A fortress repaired by the Seljuks in 1231 and one of the most magnificent sights on the coast crowns the headland. Nearly 150 towers punctuate the walls of the well-preserved double-walled citadel. Within the outer walls are ruins of mosques a caravanserai and a covered bazaar and within the inner walls can be found a ruined cistern and a Byzantine church. Although Alanyas history dates back to Roman times it rose to prominence under the Seljuks when in 1220 Alaeddin Keykubat made it his winter residence and naval base. The surviving buildings reflect the importance of the city in Seljuk times. Besides the impressive citadel tourists should explore the unique dockyards and the octagonal Kızıl Kule Red Tower.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1ee,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/troy,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Troy From Homer to Hollywood Movies HomeDestinationsTroy Troy is an enchanting and historic place embracing the cultural treasures of the east and west. All brought to life by the ancient sagas. 2018 was declared Year of Troy in Culture and Tourism to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Troys addition to the UNESCO World Heritage List. With over five thousand years of history Troy has been a fertile source of inspiration for bards and poets and has gained immortality in the imagination of those who have read her story. This timeless story which weaves together themes of power victory and love has attracted people for hundreds of years and the many civilisations acquainted with the Troy have been enriched by the descriptions of the legendary Trojan heroes and their exploits. Troy which forms a priceless part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List welcomes visitors to be inspired by her magical history and precious archaeological finds. The ancient city of Troy is situated some 30 kms from Çanakkale near Tevfikiye village in İntepe. Known in history as Troas the history of Çanakkale region as a place of settlement goes back to 5000 BC Late Neolithic Age. It spreads over an area of 9737 km2 and its coastline is 671 km long. Geographically Troy is set at a strategic point at the crossroads of two continents where trade routes converge. The significance of Troy is not due only to the value of the archaeological finds discovered here but also to the skill of Homer the famous bard from İzmir who immortalized Troy in The Iliad. This epic story has proved to have a lasting attraction throughout the ages. Priam was the patriotic king of rich and prosperous Troy. The strategic importance of his countrys location made it all the more desirable to the colonies. Paris King Priam&39s son was asked by the God Zeus to be the judge at the worlds first beauty contest set on Mt. Ida. Aphrodite Hera and Athena were to be the contestants. Each of these goddesses offered him a bribe to be chosen as the most beautiful. Hera promised to make him Lord of Europe and Asia Athena that he would lead the Trojans to victory against the Achaeans and Aphrodite that the fairest woman in the world would be his. Paris chose Aphrodite and awarded her the coveted golden apple. He then travelled directly to Sparta to see Helen the fairest woman in the world. Upon seeing Helen the wife of Menelaus Paris fell in love with her and she with him and they eloped together for troy. Menelaus supposing that Helen had been abducted by Paris set off to Troy to take her back with a huge army consisting of hundreds of fleets. This was the cause of the Trojan War which continued for ten years. King Agamemnnon was in command of the colonie which had been waiting for many years for the opportunity to conquer Troy. The invincible warrior Achilles blessed with invulnerability in every part of his body except his heel entered into the war with the Myrmidons to gain glory. Hector son of King Priam was a succesful warrior astounding all the Achaean kings with his prowess and a mighty commander who loved his country. Troy could not be captured due to the strength of its walls and the success of Hector and the war continued for 9 years without any result. Odysseus however understood that they could only capture Troy with the help of a clever strategy. According to his plan the Achaeans gave the impression that they had given up fighting and were returning home leaving behind a gigantic Wooden Horse as a gift to the Trojans. The Trojans accepted the gift supposing that it was a votive offering to the Gods and took it into the city walls. The warriors hidden inside the wooden horse got out of it at night whilst the inhabitants of the city were asleep and opened the city gate to let the other warriors inside. Thus they captured Troy and looted the city. Heinrich Schliemann who had grown up with the fascinating stories of Troy began excavations to realize his dream of finding Homers Troy on the hills of Hisarlık in Çanakkale in 1871. Following his dream of locating the magnificent treasures of King Priams Troyi Schliemann caused extensive damage during his excavations. He also took the priceless artefacts which he discovered out of Turkey illegally. In subsequent periods the excavations were organized systematically and carried out by the teams of Cincinnati University under the supervision of Carl Blegen. Since 1988 the excavation work has been continued by an international team consisting of many archaeologists under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Manfred Korfmann from the University of Tübingen. Restoration work is still being carried out as well as geophysical and topographic work. The ancient city of Troy which has great significance for European history and literature was declared a Historic National Park with the approval of the relevant Turkish Ministries and added to the World Cultural Heritage List by UNESCO in 1996. The excavations carried out in the ancient city of Troy have brought to light the fact that the first settlement goes back to 3000 BC. Troy is a 16-meter high settlement mound like those seen in Anatolia in the whole of south-western Asia and in the southeast. Due to the convenience of its location the hill was settled by various civilizations at different times. Excavations have revealed a total of 9 periods of settlement in this ancient city which was established 5 thousand years ago. Troy I dates back to 3000-2500 BC and it is regarded as Early Middle and Late Troy I. The east tower of the city gate of the walls has been renovated to a large extent and it is in good condition. There is a house know as one of the oldest megaron type of houses which is constructed to a long and narrow shaped plan and consists of a portico and a large room with a hearth at the centre of it. In Troy I the walls were built in a herringbone pattern which is peculiar to this period and copper and bronze were used to make tools. Troy II consists of 7 layers piled on top of one another. Each of them has city walls. Wheel-made pottery is seen in this period. Moreover attractive jewellery made of gold silver and electrum various ornaments and cup forms were found. Archaeological finds reveal that no important progress was made during the settlement period of Troy III when compared to the other settlement periods of Troy. Troy IV and V date back to 2200-1800 BC. Ruins of houses and walls were found in this settlement period. The existence of ceramic artefacts of the early Hellas period indicates that there was a commercial relationship between Troy and the ancient City States on todays Greek land. Imported Mycenaean and Cypriot cups seen in the settlement period of Troy VI were also discovered in Troy VII. Troy VII is likely to be King Priams Troy where the Trojan War broke out. Traces of a huge fire are seen in this period. The oldest of the finds in the settlement period of Troy VIII does not go back further than the 7th century BC. This makes us think that after the settlement period 7b 2 the city was either abandoned by its inhabitants or continued its existence as a small settlement until the 7th century. The excavations carried out in this settlement period revealed the magnificent Temple of Athena and remnants of two altars. Troy IX was built during the Roman Period. The theatre remnants of a building with mosaic tile to the fore and Bouleuterion of this period are quite impressive. Scientific research has shown that culturally Troy was an Anatolian civilization. Schliemann turned his dreams into reality however he destroyed much of Troy as a result of the unsystematic excavations which he carried out. He also took many of Troys precious artefacts out of Anatolia illegaly to the German city of Berlin. After the 2nd World War the artefacts which were on display in the Museum Fur Vor-Und Frühgeschichte until 1940 were taken awaty to Russia as war treasures. In 1993 after many years of silence Russia admitted that the treasures of Troy were in their country. Other finds from the ancient city of Troy were also taken out of Turkey illegally over the years and dispersed among 50 different museums. The Republic of Turkey has been endeavouring to reclaim her cultural heritage for many years in accordance with the princible of UNESCO which is that every historic treasure should remain in its native country. The Republic of Turkey has organized various activities to introduce the Trojan artefacts of Anatolian Culture to the world. One such activity was the exhibition Troy-Dreams and Reality organized by Turkey and Germany in 2001 as a cultural and scientific co-operation. The artefacts carefully selected from the collections of 12 museums in Turkey were sent to Germany for the exhibition. Hundreds of thousands of people saw these artefacts and were introduced to the culture of which they are a product. Although excavations in the Historic National Park of Troy are continuing it is still possible to visit Troy. You can observe the excavations and see the archaeological remains in their unique geographic location. Archaeological finds unearthed at the systematic excavation of Troy are on display in the Museum of Çanakkale and the İstanbul Archaeological Museum and these museums are an excellent source of further information on the area and its history. Thousands of people visit Troy each year to see the artefacts and architectural remains of the 9 settlement periods. Just by soaking up the atmosphere of the city you can experience the spirit of Troy theri imagination kindled by the replica wooden horse at the site.

It is the traditional houses of Safranbolu that have earned the city a world-wide reputation and inscribed it on UNESCOs World Heritage List with many trailing back to 18-19th century however the fact that the locals manage to keep the traditional lifestyle alive takes the visitors on a journey back in time. As you walk along Safranbolu’s streets sheltering over 2000 traditional Turkish-Ottoman houses you will grasp the opportunity of exploring the elegancy of Ottoman housing architecture and of becoming familiar with the traditional lifestyle of its hospitable locals. The Select Samples of The Ottoman Civilian Architecture Safranbolu Houses Safranbolu managing to preserve its complete old settlement texture is home to historical houses grouped in two main areas The first is the Bazaar section thats mostly used during winter and previously known as the City while the second one is previously known as Vineyards and was mostly used during summer time. The locals spent the winter months in the City and they moved to their summerhouses in the Vineyards upon the arrival of warmer summer days however life in marketplace the centre of production and trade used to be lively and hectic through the year. With thier unique architecture and locations the houses of Safranbolu give the guests insight into the former Turkish lifestyle. Safranbolu houses were mostly built by the side of the valley for two reasons the first is to avert the occupation of fertile agricultural lands and the second is associated with the good grace and decency of neighbour relations among the Turkish people. Because the houses were constructed on the slopes they do not hinder one anothers view and exposure to sunlight. The upper stories supported by buttresses project over the cobbled pavements which were made as inclined to resist flood waters and to minimize humid effect. Safranbolu adores those who set eyes on its beautiful houses that defy time with their sound stance and reflect an architecture of superior taste in company with fine wooden decoration. Some houses designed as museums have an eye-catching wooden artwork on ceilings and some possess an indoor pool to cool the air and to avoid fire. The Lands Where Worlds Most Expensive Spices Grow The name of the town derives from saffron and Safranbolu is where the best quality saffron in the world is produced. The cultivation and care of saffron is very demanding however it is worth the effort since it is capable of coloring a fluid one hundred thousand times as heavy as the saffron itself with yellow. Being used in pharmaceutical food and cosmetics industries it carries the title of being the most expensive spice in the world. Safranbolus Famous Turkish Delight A Matchless Flavour Safranbolu has made a name for itself with its perfectly-flavoured Turkish delight lokum a dessert regarded to be a leading flavour in the Turkish cuisine culture. The reason is Safranbolus lokum is lighter and the mineral-rich natural water sprung from Safranbolu is used in the making of this dessert which means you must taste and buy lokum as a gift during your visit to Safranbolu. How to Go? Safranbolu is well accessible by road from İstanbul and Ankara. There are regular coach departures to Safranbolu from both cities. Safranbolu is roughly 5 hours’ drive from İstanbul while it is 25 hours from Ankara.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1f3,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/gulhane-park,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Gülhane Park Gardens Of Topkapı Palace HomeDestinationsGülhane Park Gülhane means the House of Roses and is located in the gardens of Topkapı Palace. Once only accessible to the royal court is now open to the public. It is the oldest and one of the largest public parks in Istanbul. The Sur-i Sultani within the Royal Walls includes not only the buildings that have stood witness to important episodes in world history but also beautiful landscaped gardens. The first of those gardens is Gülhane Rosehouse Park. Today the tulip is a flower mainly associated with other countries. Perhaps in your mind too tulips are identified with other countries. However you should know that the first tulip bulbs were sent abroad from İstanbul in the Ottoman Period. The tulip has even lent its name to the most controversial era of Ottoman history. If you visit İstanbul in season you will find tulips in bloom in Gülhane Park – a wonderful haven for those trying to escape from summer heat a place where you can enjoy sea breezes under the cool shade of centuries-old trees. The park also has a panoramic view of the Sea of Marmara the Golden Horn and the İstanbul Strait as it is situated on the tip of the historical peninsula. The park is also associated with the Tanzimat reorganisation of the state reforms since the Rescript of Gülhane was proclaimed here. The Tanzimat Museum which exhibits documents and photographs relating to that important period of the Ottoman Empire is situated in Gülhane Park. The Has Ahırlar Royal Stables is a part of Gülhane Park and at present they house the Islamic Science and Technology Museum. The museum exhibits replicas built according to written records of various devices and tools invented and developed by Islamic scientists between the 8th and 16th centuries. Among them are the world map designed by 70 geographers and astronomers in a thirty-year period in 9th century and the oldest clock of the world that works in accordance with the time system which is still in use. We recommend a visit to the museum for an insight into the contribution of scientists from the Islamic world to the world history of science.

5eae9daf2dae09d3a6b6b1f4,https://www.goturkey.com/destinations/side,DestinationsAttractionsTravel MapEventsBlogGallery MENU Side A Dream Painted in Sunset Hues HomeDestinationsSide Turquoise sea golden sand light glistening on ancient ruins… A dream painted in sunset hues… Shaped by the cooling waters and soft sands of the Mediterranean heir to the riches of antiquity and child of the modern world Side is the perfect destination equally rich in ancient treasures and the gems of contemporary entertainment shopping and comfortable accommodation. Side is a superb choice for a holiday whether your aim is to bath in sun sea and sand or to repose in harmony with nature under a soft leafy canopy or to explore the regions unparalleled history wandering mesmerised through the ruins of antiquity. Here sea and sky exist in perfect harmony and where the waters meet the side of the peninsula golden beaches give on to ancient ruins cafes superb restaurants and souvenir shops. Natural marvels such as Manavgat Waterfall and Köprülü Canyon National Park are easily accessible. It’s all here. Ruins of antiquity reflecting the spirit of time The ancient Side was a centre of commerce and the temples were built next to its harbour so that gods would protect it. One of these is the temple believed to have been devoted to Men the God of Moon which stands next to the other temples. The people of Side worshipped Cybele and Men before Athena and Apollo. During the Christian Era the temples of the sacred field were substituted for a basilica and a church. The basilica was built in 5th century AD and the church was built in the 8th or 9th century. The god and goddess of Side Apollo and Athena adorned the coins minted in here. The reverse however showed the pomegranate the symbol of fertility and life represented by Cybele and Athena. The word Side itself means pomegranate. Small and large from coins to temples these ancient objects provide us highly valuable information regarding the history beliefs culture and daily life of Side. Gateway to the masterpieces of antiquity Ancient Side welcomes its visitors through the Main Gate set between two towers of the insurmountable city walls standing directly across from the monumental fountain. The Main Gate dates to the 2nd century and together with the horse shoe shaped colonnaded courtyard it was also used for ceremonial processions. The monumental fountain across from the gate had three wide arches and a basin and it was also built in the 2nd century. It is the largest ancient fountain of Anatolia. Originally the structure had three levels and it was decorated with marble cladding and reliefs however at present only a single level is standing and a few decorations of the pool can be seen. Manavgat River used to provide water to the fountain through aqueducts splendid examples of human ingenuity working in tandem with the gifts of nature. Sections of the aqueducts are still visible. Passing through the Main Gate and courtyard there are two roads originally lined with corinthian columns the main road that continues straight ahead and another leading off to the left. The main road which channelled the social and cultural life of ancient Side is lined with porticoes providing sheltered access to the shops and houses and passes through the agora and city centre where a bathhouse a theatre and fountains once stood. The road eventually reaches the tip of the peninsula site of the harbour and temples symbols of commerce and religion. Agora where slaves famed for their beauty were sold After entering ancient Side and proceeding on the main road the groups of ruins on the left are from the bishopric basilica surrounded with columns and the palace. A little further down on the same road again on the left is the commercial agora which is one of the two agorae the city. Apart from its traditional function as a venue for commerce and a forum to discuss the political and economic situation the commercial agora of Side assumed another function. In the first century BC a passage was built that connected the commercial agora to the theatre nearby and both the agora and the theatre served as a slave market. In the middle of the agora where slaves famed for their beauty were traded used to stand a temple devoted to Fortuna the goddess of luck and trade which had a round plan lined with 12 columns with corinthian capitals. The Agora was lined with porticos and large shops behind them. At one corner of the agora next to the theatre stood the latrina the public toilets of the city. The latrina which was a decorated structure covered with domes and connected to the sewers laid under the main road is a proof of excellence in city planning in Antiquity. On the opposite side of the road across the agora stood the Roman Bathhouse from the 5th century which now serves as a museum where magnificent sculptures busts and sarcophagi are on permanent display. The Museum of Side which resembles Olympus the home of the gods and goddesses The Museum of Side with the statues and figurines of gods and goddesses on display seems like Olympus the home of the gods and goddesses. Here the gods and goddesses of Olympus compete with each other to whisper myth and legend in the ear of visitors. Zeus Aphrodite Ares Nike Hygeia Asclepius Apollo Hermes Dionysus Heracles Tyche and Athena – the heroes and heroines of the legends that they narrate themselve in the Museum of Side.

Strewn with marble monuments landscaped lawns the occasional elegant building the Palacio de Cristal is especially worth seeking out and abundant greenery it’s quiet and contemplative during the week but comes to life on weekends. Put simply this is one of our favourite places in Madrid. Tickets & tours Scrooser Retiro Park Tour £31.58 and up Details Retiro Park Treasures 3H Bike Tour £26.24 and up Details Buen Retiro Park Tour with Prado Museum Skip-the-Line Ticket £39.37 and up Details More tickets & tours Details Plaza de la Independencia Hours6am-midnight Apr-Sep to 10pm Oct-Mar Laid out in the 17th century by Felipe IV as the preserve of kings queens and their intimates the park was opened to the public in 1868 and ever since when the weather’s fine and on weekends in particular madrileños people from Madrid from all across the city gather here to stroll read the Sunday papers in the shade take a boat ride or nurse a cool drink at the numerous outdoor terrazas open-air cafes. The focal point for so much of El Retiro’s life is the artificial estanque lake which is watched over by the massive ornamental structure of the Monument to Alfonso XII on the east side complete with marble lions. As sunset approaches on a Sunday afternoon in summer the crowd grows bongos sound out across the park and people start to dance. Row boats can be rented from the lakes northern shore – an iconic Madrid experience. On the southern end of the lake the odd structure decorated with sphinxes is the Fuente Egipcia legend has it that an enormous fortune buried in the park by Felipe IV in the mid-18th century rests here. Hidden among the trees south of the lake is the Palacio de Cristal a magnificent metal-and-glass structure that is arguably El Retiro’s most beautiful architectural monument. It was built in 1887 as a winter garden for exotic flowers and is now used for temporary exhibitions organised by the Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. Just north of here the 1883 Palacio de Velázquez is also used for temporary exhibitions. At the southern end of the park near La Rosaleda with its more than 4000 roses is a statue of El Ángel Caído The Fallen Angel. Strangely it sits 666m above sea level… The Puerta de Dante in the extreme southeastern corner of the park is watched over by a carved mural of Dante’s Inferno. Occupying much of the southwestern corner of the park is the Jardín de los Planteles one of the least visited sections of El Retiro where quiet pathways lead beneath an overarching canopy of trees. West of here is the moving Bosque del Recuerdo an understated memorial to the 191 victims of the 11 March 2004 train bombings. For each victim stands an olive or cypress tree. To the north just inside the Puerta de Felipe IV stands what is thought to be Madrid’s oldest tree a Mexican conifer ahuehuete planted in 1633. In the northeastern corner of the park is the Ermita de San Isidro a small country chapel noteworthy as one of the few albeit modest examples of Romanesque architecture in Madrid. When it was built Madrid was a small village more than 2km away.

Hello all you YANKS! This is what my good AUSSIE friend Kirsty calls me...I think it is so funny! As you all might known this is a STUDY abroad experience. Here goes the STUDY part about my trip... Classes started on the 21st of February. I am taking 4 classes Colonial Australian History Theatre and Performing Philosophy and Orientation to Coaching an exercise class! also so I can understand what Joe is doing with his life goals. There is your shout out Joe!! There are very different set ups of the classes than in the US. For example for each class there are lectures and tutorials. For my theatre class I even have a workshop class. The lectures are typical classes in the U.S. but this is WITHOUT questions and not much interaction between the student and professor. They would like you to save your questions for the tutorials. My tutorials range between 6-16 student per class. Since it is smaller the professor can explain topics to your specific needs. I REALLY like this system. I am very shy to ask questions in front of a large group but when Im in my tutorial I feel much more comfortable speaking Petersons Winery up! For the most part classes are going really well. There is much more reading and papers assigned at UNE than at Lock Haven. I am most nervous about Philosophy and History but I think in the long run Ill be alright! This past weekend our good friend Preet took us to some of the local wineries! It was a blast! The weather was perfect and the area was so pretty. The wineries were only about 20 minutes away from Uni so the drive wasnt bad at all. It was fun to taste test some locally grown wine and enjoy the day with friends! Since Chelsea Heather and I AND MOST PEOPLE AT UNE dont have any Friday classes our friends Tom and Piers are taking us to the beach this weekend!!! Tom lives in Port Macquarie which is a very touristy beach town. The drive will take about 4 hours but Im SOO excited!! Maybe this will be my chance to learn how to surf! We also might be able to meet up with Kirsty this weekend. She is heading home for her Mums birthday! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MUM!! She lives about 40 minutes away from where Petersons Winery Heather Chelsea and I! we will be staying! It would be heaps of fun if we could get together with her! I hope everyone has a great weekend!!

The Naniwa hotel was a comfy nights rest and the hosts as helpful as ever despite their limited english and yesterdays misunderstanding! I am certainly glad I speak some lingo - several people I have met have had no or limited ability and even in the major cities like Tokyo have struggled to get their needs met or point across. A bit of charades always comes in handy but anything slightly complicated can get mixed up even if you do speak Japanese!! A gorgeous clear warm mornning dawned and I decided after my early waking habit to get the earlier train just before 9am. The Akita shinkansen originating and terminating at Akita Tokyo bound/ from means the trip to Tazawako and nearby Kakunodate is quick and painless but reservations are a must. Being a monday morning the difference in commuters was striking....................very few occupied seats many business folk working in the provincial towns and one American girl I met who teaches English in Akita but was changing to Tokyo. From her suggestions and praises of Lk Tazawa I knew exactly where I was headed in my 4 hr stopover in Tazawako town. That being taking the bus to Tazawako-han dorothy dorothy... pedal boats for the leisure seekers that just LOVE different modes of transport! on the shores of this pristine lake the 2nd clearest in Japan the 1st is in Hokkaido Lk Moshi?. If it werent for the tacky pedal boats with hello kitty or pink dinosaur faces I could say I was somewhere such as Lk Hayes or Lk taupo. Yet it turned out to be a stunner of an early summer day that you could not help feeling like sunbathing or...............swimming! Yes how on earth can pauline go without a swim at least once on holiday. It would not be a summer holiday by a beautiful lake/ waterway without an obligatory swim ein fact it would be rude not! Even if the locals forbid you do partake until at least July or August. You see Lk Tazawako is a little tsumetai cool but very deep 440m approx at its deepest point and the deepest in Japan. Despite this dialogue I emphasised I was a kiwi and that having grown up in or by water of varying temperatures that the cold it really was not that bad! would not put me off especially as the mercury got to 28C today! You see my point!! So as for leisure I caught the bus en route to the jinja from Tazawako station 7km to the stopping point of Tazawako-han surrounded by souvenir shops and cheap nasty soba restaurants in usual japanese resort style. There are some hotels here scattered around the 20km perimeter of the lake and one camping ground I saw but they are pricey and unless you get here with plenty time on your hands the connections by bus outiside 5 or 6pm are poor. So I was lucky that this bus met the shinkansen timetable quite well. With now about 2.5 hrs to spare I made a B line for the Gozano ishi jinja about- 5km from the bus stop along the lakeside and on some parts of road - the cars only travel at 40 to ５０kph and are VERY courteous at giving any cyclist hire bikes are available or pedestrian on a tour of leisure or enlightenment or both! En route there are heart herb gardens a cafe or two a few poet and statues of significance to Akitas feudal past and of course lovely lush green and turquoise lake scenery. After visiting the temple and hearing some eerie high pitched chanting and soft string instrument sounds as I approaced I came Gozano ishi jinja shrine a pleasant flat walk from town I have no understanding of its purpose whatsoever except that it gave me some enlightenment...that I must go to the nearest foreshore and bathe! across a group of nuns. We exchanged japanese conversation for a while and so it turned out they had friends in Auckland and did I know them................the world is small but not that so??! Their dog I will call them Lassie was extremely photogenic so I just had to indulge in a photo. After I started making my way back towards the town bus stop all the while stopping for photos of inflatable cowboy scarecrows and various other kodak moments they passed me in their little daihatsu..............obviously nuns are allowed to drive..!.......and offered me a lift. But being so close to that magic bathing spot where I could very possibly have done a nudey as NO ONE was around I declined. And no it wasnt a nude dip.................the sight of my caucasian body would really freak the locals out not mention offend them! So I got enlightenment and leisure in one go. When I swam I got a few stares and sugois! from some local ladies doing crafts under the trees that I didnt see and two who decided to walk by. It is forbidden you see until at least next month. Bugger that it was 28C for gods before could not contain my excitement at a cool lake on a hot summers day I decided the clothed option was better choice.. sake! Also a young man huddled over his mobile phone and IPOD then deicided it wasnt exciting at all the watch the gaijin drown herself in Lk Tazawako and left. So I virtually had it all to myself. Pure joy in such simplicity! I got back to Tazawako station after and connected with the shinkansen in plenty time not before collecting my belongings from the very handy albeit SMALL do not bring a 60 pack to japan coin lockers not before a visit to a close supermarket that sold everything. There are also souvenir shops and a few boutique restaurants. The tourist office folk based in the train station were helpful with maps of the Tazawako area and there is no hassles with trains as long as you book in advance i.e. more than 5-10mins before it leaves with a rail pass. With a few chops and changes via Morioka and Hachinohe I have managed to now cross the straits and am in Hokkaido stopping off here in Hakodate. The Seikan tunnel is a neat experience - this spans 58.3km from northern Iwate ken to southern Hakodate province runs 140m below sea level and a further 100m below after happy as a pig in mud the evidence! the sea bed. So your ears get a bit congested if you are prone to it like me! The fastest crossing is in 24 mins the slowest in 27 mins and the train seats give a blow by blow account of exactly where in underground tunnel space you are down to the minute....now that is very japanese!! It is dark and noisy and there is no big bang upon reaching Hokkaido. But the whole trip is peppered with more rolling fields vast plains hills close by and steep farther away workers toiling in the paddies and numerous plastic hot houses testament to the indoor growing methods of this cooler northern area of Japan. Arriving at hakodate at 720pm was refreshing...cooler than Akita I would hazard a guess at 12C and after some navigation and asking of locals I found the smokey yet satisfactory Aqau garden hotel hakodate. Success tyhis time with internet reservations through Rakuten travel and although pricey as Hakodate can be Im just happy to have a comfy bed to get some proper sleep! But not before a quick whip into the CONBENIENCE STOORU for supplies for tomorrows long haul to Wakkanai and then the lively entering Iwate prefecture home of Morioka city another shinkansen kodak moment harbour for some night photography and a glimpse of Mt hakodate which like almost all japanese peaks has a cable car reached by bus...................this place is renound for its early fishy markets and mist so to see a reasonably clear night with a crescent moon and the lights of the cable car restaurant 7 km away was a bonus! So onwards to the top from tomorrow via Sapporo. I wonder if again I will see some local hillbilly folk that enlighten themselves not with a jinja visit like at Tazawako but with Asahi Drys at 9am on the train??? I tell you it just gets more and more interesting this place!!!! « Previous Entry Next Entry » Additional photos below Photos 13 Displayed 13 Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 2 Message Traveling hands pn76 When there’s nowhere to go there’s travel.

Oh no hang on a minute ... ‘You’ve done what? You’ve booked us a room in a BROTHEL???’ I shrieked. ’No no’ said Steve ‘it’s a luuuurve hotel. It’s just for one night it’s near the airport and it’s relatively cheap which is what we need.’ Well the deed was done so not much I could do about it and the more I thought about it the more I thought it might be a bit of an er – experience? So we were delivered to Perth Airport in the rain and for once I didn’t mind too much given that we were leaving it behind. The lovely Christmas tree we had seen in the sunshine outside Arrivals five weeks ago was the same tree we now saw all lit up in the dark because we were leaving from the same place we had arrived at. OK – Arrivals is Departures now then. This morning we were heading back to Taiwan because we had ‘dropped out’ of our Round The World ticket there to do a cheaper independent flight to Australia and What is this? Wheres my brothel?! we had to get back there to pick it up where we left off. We were back on the dreaded Air Asia X airline. I was fully prepared this time back in the winter clothes all long sleeves and long trousers. I’d even dug out my scarf and gloves! No freezing on an unheated plane for me this time oh no. We didn’t get off to a good start as we were due to depart at 6.50 am and didn’t take off until 7.30 am. Here we go ... The flight was rather bumpy and surprisingly warm and I wondered if that had anything to do with the heat ash and debris that the Krakatoa volcano was currently belching out as our flight-path took us within spitting distance of it. Our pilot assured us that our ‘slight’ diversion around it was quite enough to be safe. We were tossed around so much I wasn’t convinced. Nevertheless we landed safely in Kuala Lumpur about 1.15 pm and had another wait in transit for our connecting flight due to depart at 5.45 pm in the same holding area as previously. Still at least this time we knew where everything was and The garage! luckily bagsied two of the soft seats to settle down into. We exchanged some Aussie dollars for KL ringits and managed to fit in a bite to eat and a lot of people-watching keeping an eye on the board all the while for the departure gate number to be posted. When it was we began to gather ourselves to board our next flight. I casually paid a final visit to the loo we were back in the Land of the Hole in the Floor which I had forgotten about so had to wait for a western-style cubicle to become vacant had a last cigarette and we queued up for another screening check and were casually sauntering down the loooong corridor to our boarding gate when we suddenly heard the last call for our flight! How did we go from having ample time to running the risk of missing the flight? We moved our speed-walking up a notch to a fair jog when the next last call was made and by the time we arrived at the boarding gate at the final last call we were outright running and gasping for breath and were amongst the very last to board. The luuuurve hotel room Geez. There’s a lesson to be learned there somewhere ... The flight was uneventful but was again late taking off which was irritating because we’d nearly burst a gasket to catch it. We landed in Taiwan at 10.30 pm and had to queue FOR AGES to get through Immigration. We had been shuffling backwards and forwards through those serpentine barriers airports like to use for at least 30 minutes when we saw a sign saying at this point in the queue we had another 30 minutes to go. Twenty minutes later we came to a sign saying we had another 20 minutes to go. Hang on does time travel at a different speed in Taiwan? We eventually cleared Immigration but only after a team of REALLY tall basketball players held things up by not having completed their entry cards properly and I was surprised when we exited the airport and it was ‘only’ 11.30 pm. Maybe there’d been a bit of a time warp ... We had arranged for transport from the luuuurve hotel to collect us at the airport. Please God don’t let it be a pimpmobile emblazoned with the name of the brothel and/or have explicit Big bath livery in lurid colours. In fact it was a plain black affair with quite tasteful discreet gold lettering. We drove through the night streets of Taipei and there wasn’t much to see which was probably a good job as I suspect the area was less than salubrious. I slid lower and lower in my seat in case we might pass someone who would recognise me as if in Taiwan but y’know .... Finally we pulled in to the driveway of the TY Motel all lit up with crimson lamps see I knew we were in the red light district and an arm appeared out of a shed. We exchanged our passports for a plain brown paper bag what the ...?? before they were returned to us with a key by the disembodied arm in the hut. Our driver drove us up to an open garage door and unloaded our suitcases. A garage?! OK – this was not what I was expecting and I was almost ready to demand that we be taken to the room we had booked in the brothel when the driver pointed us to a door at the back of the garage - and there was our Condoms and stuff! luuuurve hotel room! It turns out that the luuuurve hotel wasn’t a brothel and I was a little disappointed at that after all. It was more a venue for illicit liaisons. Cars could drive in to the garage close the door and no-one would know they were there. It had mood lighting yes even in the garage and on entering our room 208 I was pleasantly surprised! It was clean spacious and unsurprisingly had an enormous bed and TV screen the biggest I had ever seen. Turns out this was so that occupants could view all the porn channels in close-up detail! It had a huge circular bath with a waterfall tap a separate shower and loo with a strange sliding door feature that allowed privacy of a sort for one or the other but not both at the same time and all the amenities we needed for an overnight stay. It was styled in a fashion that would have fit nicely in an Austin Powers film all faux silk bedding and subdued lighting with not a window to be seen apart from the frosted glass in the door that led into the garden area which was surrounded by Oh its a hair spider ... an eight foot high fence. If you knew no better you’d think it was just a normal though quirky hotel room but the tactful positioning of the condoms and lubricants on the bedside table might just give it away. I didn’t go through my usual routine of ‘touching’ everything on this occasion – you just never know! I did investigate the plain brown paper bag we had been given though to discover it contained a pot noodle type meal and some chopsticks. We weren’t sure if this was intended as an evening meal or breakfast as all our interactions so far had been done without a word of English being spoken but still it was ... considerate? I also investigated the bathroom accessories box and a dark wicked-looking spikey thing stood out amongst the toothbrushes sponges combs and razors. Maybe this was some sado-masochistic implement of torture? No – it turned out to be a hair spider! I’ll be having that ... We had a phone call from the office asking what time we wanted to be collected for the airport the following morning. ‘10.30 am please’ we said. The language barrier was a bit of a problem Huge TV in Taiwan boudoir and we weren’t absolutely sure we had understood the question or that they had understood our answer. We eventually shouted it as that seems to work normally. After unsuccessfully looking for a switch that might make the bed vibrate in a somewhat relaxing fashion and after being on the move for 24 hours without sleep we finally fell in to the enormous silky mood-lit bed without taking advantage of the various add-ons offered and promptly fell asleep! We were collected the next morning at 10.30 am sharp. This place really had its act together. We left without having seen another person apart from our driver which I suppose was the point of the place! The only clue I had that other people were using the hotel was the slightly open door to the garden of the room next door when I was out there having a cigarette. I was really taken with it! We were delivered to Terminal 2 for our onward flight. Today we were heading for Japan. Yes that’s right Japan. Not that we were planning on staying there it was just a means to an end on this somewhat strange route we were taking to Mount Fuji Japan our ultimate destination. Terminal 2 was lovely. There was no queue for check-in and only a tiny queue for Immigration where the initially belligerent officious Man With The Wand hit me on the nose with it and collapsed into giggles before realising that this was perhaps not the appropriate response to committing bodily harm. He was somewhat relieved that I also saw the funny side and promised not to sue him! All the departure gates were themed covering Animal Protection Indigenous People etc and were lovely spaces to pass an otherwise boring waiting time. We were flying on Japan Airlines and they were super-efficient which was no surprise. We took off bang on time at 1.20 pm and were waved off by the ground crew on the tarmac which was a lovely touch. The cabin crew were super all smiles and helpfulness and we had a lovely meal of rice and pork served with a dash of oriental spice. We arrived at Narita Airport with night just falling and Mount Fuji clear against the sunset. It was stunning. Sadly it all went a bit skew-whiff from there on. We transited across to our next waiting area and found two Plane engine in bits lovely leather seats looking out across to our next Japan Airlines plane sitting there on the tarmac. Unfortunately it was sitting there on the tarmac with one of its engines in bits. We watched as a mechanic climbed the ladders into the engine then left shrugging his shoulders. The ladders were removed then returned. Another mechanic came and left. A group of mechanics came and stood there looking bewildered. We were supposed to depart at 8.30 pm Japan time – I’d lost track of any time differences now if there were any and time ticked by. Somebody turned up with a spare part then left taking the spare part with him. OK – I’m getting twitchy now. As a nervous flyer I like to know the planes I’m in have engines that are up to the job. No information whatsoever was forthcoming from the ground staff and I was pleased we hadn’t gone through to the departures holding area where we would have been stuck. I wandered around the airport and found the amazing smoking area provided by the nicotine-addicted Japanese. There were worse places to spend the time. I also found the toilets which had the wonderful Japanese-style loos Smoking area Narita airport complete with instructions in English so no danger of pressing the wrong button on this occasion! The engine was eventually put back together and we were able to board on 4.1.19 at 10.30 pm Japan time. The pilot told us it was his decision to ensure that the plane was working properly before take-off yes I agree that would be a good idea and he apologised for the delay no need I’m with you on that one. As it turned out the engine was completely up to the job it had to do. We had another lovely meal a crab starter tagliatelle with beef in a sauce and really fresh salad with rice crackers followed by an unidentifiable but very nice dessert and eventually landed on 4.1.19 again at 10.00 am again. Yes we really had gone back in time. About 19 hours by my reckoning! I’d no idea what time zone we were in or what planet we were on by this stage. All I knew was that we were finally in the place we were aiming for.

After a blissful few days off the beaten tourist track on the island of Shikoku I have returned once more to the tourist trail. But this feels very different to Kyoto – most tourists here are either Japanese or Westerners there are no hordes from the Chinese mainland which is a relief. It also feels a bit different here – I’m not sure if it’s just me but I feel the people here seem a little feistier hardier than I’ve seen in other places. There are some really friendly people but this doesn’t always seem the case and compared to other places so far where everyone greets you in a lift for example not everyone does so here. I wonder if it’s just the way people are here or I do indeed wonder if in fact the memories from 1945 some anti-western sentiments still continue here. I wouldn’t be surprised to be honest I’ve often wondered whilst here how I would feel if the situation were reversed – if the Japanese had dropped a nuclear bomb during World War Two on England perhaps would all English people today including myself 73 years later be so Atomic Bomb Dome Hiroshima welcoming towards Japanese visitors…? Alas my time here has indeed been spent contemplating the events of 6th August 1945 as indeed would most visitors I believe who come here. Yesterday I spent around the Peace Memorial areas of Hiroshima whilst today I enjoyed a wonderful day on the nearby sacred island of Miyajima. I believe I last wrote from Matsuyama about to leave this really agreeable city on the beautiful island of Shikoku. On Wednesday morning I took a bus to the ferry terminal and then the slow ferry as opposed to the super-jet hydrofoil taking a blissful three hours to cross back over Japan’s Inland Sea arriving back on the main island of Honshu this time in the port city of Hiroshima. From Hiroshima’s ferry terminal I took a streetcar or tram to my current accommodation another wonderfully welcoming small but highly efficient business hotel the Vessel Inn Hiroshima Ekimae. Indeed my travels here do not involve taxis between stations and hotels but public transport everywhere and walks of up to half-a-mile so far from tram bus or metro stop to hotel. This has been manageable and despite the sweltering temperatures I can do pretty well with Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum The exact date and time of the bomb - 8.15am 6th August 1945 my backpacks balanced – the big one on the back the small one on the front. They are indeed filling up fairly quickly with souvenirs but this I do not mind at all and is one of my great pleasures of travelling at the moment – collecting original quality souvenirs and displaying them in my beautiful home when I return. After a very comfortable night’s sleep I awoke yesterday morning ready to explore the sights of Hiroshima in connection with what the city really is most widely-known for – as mentioned the events of 6th August 1945 at 8.15am to be precise. It was a very moving and emotional day. Although I am in complete and unequivocal agreement with the US decision to drop the bombs on Japan in order to end the unimaginable suffering of the six years of world war in which 60 million people worldwide lost their lives I couldn’t help but shed a tear for the innocents of Hiroshima who died so tragically and horrifically on this day and those left suffering for the rest of their lives. Whilst many more lives would have been lost had the war continued had the Americans not decisively Floating Torii Miyajima Island ended it with the two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki leading to the unconditional surrender of the Japanese it was still a moving experience to see what happened here almost exactly 73 years ago. I should also say that the Japanese were no innocent force whatsoever during the war and did atrocious and inhumane things to their opponents and prisoners - this I have not forgotten. I did spend the day however feeling the emotion and loss of the citizens of Hiroshima and was glad to have understood and seen it if not disagreeing with the decision to drop the bomb yesterday. The day began with a visit to the well-known Atomic Bomb Dome on the northern flanks of Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park. The building was once the Industrial Promotion Hall of Hiroshima originally built in 1915 and at the time was a well-known building in Japan outside of Hiroshima. The decision was made after the war to keep the outer shell of the ruined building as it is as a reminder and memorial of that terrible day. The bomb itself called Little Boy” and released by the US B-29 bomber Enola Gay” apparently not all on board the Matsuyama Ferry Terminal Gosh the things you can do at a ferry terminal nowadays...! plane that day knew what they were carrying at the time detonated 150 metres away from the building and 600 metres in the air. It was one of the few buildings which were left standing as within seconds the whole city of Hiroshima was blasted instantly killing 80000 people and destroying 90% of the buildings. With a core temperature of 2000 degrees at the centre of the detonation site it was quite unbelievable to my mind that anyone survived. Amazingly though many did though the figures are very sobering out of a population of 350000 a total of 130000 either died instantly or in the months to follow due to their injuries and radiation poisoning. The survivors were all affected all presumably having known someone who was killed and all learning to deal in some way with the pain and the loss for the rest of their lives. The Japanese government believe that as of 2015 there were around 187000 atomic bomb survivors all I am sure with stories to tell. Most of those killed were civilians including 20000 forced Korean labourers imported during the war and what was quite pertinent to me was the story of twelve US airmen Matsuyama Ferry Terminal Ferry to Hiroshima who were prisoners of war at the time in Hiroshima. Eight were killed during the blast two were subsequently executed by their captors and two who were released badly injured were then stoned to death by survivors. This last point stood out to me the most I can’t explain why. As you can imagine my day yesterday was moving and emotional. Following on from the sobering visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome I took a walk through the beautiful and equally touching Peace Memorial Park. Here lie a number of memorials. Firstly I visited the Children’s Peace Monument. This was erected in memory of the children killed by the bomb and was inspired directly from the story of Sadako Sasasi. Sadako was only two years old at the time of the bombing but like so many other survivors suffered later in life from the after-effects of the radiation poisoning developing leukaemia at only 11 years old. She believed that if she could make 1000 origami paper cranes she would be cured of her illness. Sadly she never got to achieve her goal and died before – her classmates reached her target for her. Since then Hiroshima has received countless Matsuyama Ferry Terminal Setting off origami paper cranes from people all around the world in her memory and as a gesture of peace many of which are displayed in glass cabinets behind the memorial. After this I headed to the Flame of Peace set to burn on until all the world’s nuclear weapons are destroyed. From here a short walk along the Pond of Peace past a Japanese flag flying at half-mast to the Cenotaph. This is a curved concrete monument which perfectly frames within it the Pond of Peace the Flame of Peace and the Atomic Bomb Dome in the distance. It also holds the names of all the known victims of the bomb. Beyond this was the Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound below which lies a vault containing the ashes of thousands of unclaimed or unidentified victims. After this a new building contained a very beautiful piece of artwork - a 360 degree mosaic depicting the image of Hiroshima in all directions from the centre of the bomb just after the explosion containing 130000 small tiles in total each representing a victim of the bomb. In the middle of the mosaic is a fountain depicting the time of the detonation at 815am. The water Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Japans Inland Sea flowing in the fountain is offered for the victims as many of them died begging for water. This point I felt was very emotional. Finally my walk culminated in a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum at the southern end of the Peace Memorial Park. Whilst the main building is currently undergoing repairs to make it earthquake-proof and thus off-limits to visitors the east-wing still contained a number of its most important exhibits. What stood out here for me was some moving imagery shown over a large scaled-down map of Hiroshima depicting the bomb being dropped from above then exploding in a flash of light and heat followed by the infamous mushroom cloud rising out of the centre. Other stand-outs included time spent in an individual video booth choosing to watch two out of the countless survivors’ stories to play in full. The first of a lady who was a schoolgirl at the time blinded by the flash and telling her account of trying to find her mother after the explosion. It took her a number of days but eventually she found her mother injured but safe. The second of a Japanese soldier positioned in the open air Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Me just outside the original Hiroshima Castle which was destroyed by the blast and subsequently rebuilt in 1958 who recounted in detail what happened from the flash of light to the bomb blast and the searing heat which caused his clothes to catch fire – he was able to put them out and survived the subsequent days lacking adequate food and water. Pertinent to most survivors’ stories were their descriptions of the days that followed of the heat which continued to emanate from all around for days afterwards the horrific injuries sustained by all around and their missions to be reunited sometimes successfully sometimes not with their loved ones. Finally an exhibition displaying some of the items carried and clothing worn by victims of the bomb at the time of the blast – many were kept by their family members their whole lives and subsequently donated to the museum upon their passing to serve as a reminder of never again”. In fact Hiroshima seems to have taken on a mission and my goodness do they have every right to I believe to spread the word around the world that all nuclear bombs should be destroyed. The mayors of Hiroshima apparently Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Bento lunch - these are very popular traveller set meals and can be heated up when bought. This one was absolutely delicious and cost around £3! write personal letters to the leaders of each nuclear nation every time they carry out a nuclear weapons test including 19 written to the UK to strongly protest their actions. Indeed with Hiroshima along with Nagasaki being the only two cities in the world who have personally suffered the devastating effects of a nuclear bomb attack I can completely understand their desire to spread their message of peace to all corners of the earth. Whilst my personal belief is that if you want peace in the current world we live in today you must be prepared for war – perhaps indeed at some point in the future there will be no need for nuclear weapons but I do not believe we are there yet. Despite this I completely respect Hiroshima’s efforts towards global peace and hence this is the reason why I along with many I believe view Hiroshima as the City of Peace. Indeed yesterday was an emotional moving and sobering day. It has given me much to contemplate which is indeed the very reason I planned to include Hiroshima on my journey in the first place. Today’s activities were of a completely different nature and I Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Great front-seat view! was back to being a tourist traveller and explorer again – how wonderful this was. I took a train and then a short ferry ride across to the nearby beautiful spiritual and sacred island of Miyajima. Miyajima contains the third of the three most famous sights of Japan apparently the other two I believe being Mt Fuji and the Golden Pavilion in Kyoto both of which I have also seen!. Here lies the oft-photographed torii gate built out into the tidal sands and waters just off the coast of the island the very famous Floating Torii – no visit to Japan I believe would be complete without a visit here! It was in fact the sight in Japan which I have most desired to see and feel very happy and satisfied to have visited today. Fortunately my visit was at high tide which means the torii gate was indeed floating” – at low tide it sits unphotogenically in a swamp of sand and mud! Once some irritating kayakers were out of the way I happily snapped away some amazing photos of the gate. Miyajima is also much more than the gate though and I spent much of the rest of Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Being overtaken by the super-fast Super-Jet hydrofoil! my time there exploring its stunning and once more magical primeval forest blanketing most of the island. A short walk followed by two ropeway cable car journeys and then a sweltering 30-minute hike up steep slopes brought me to the island’s highest point Mt Misen at 530 metres directly! above sea level. At the top was an amazing observatory which allowed a 360 degree view all around – back to the mainland and Hiroshima and far out in many directions over the Inland Sea and its countless islands. There was also the typical jovial atmosphere you often find in such a place where people are happy to have gotten to the top and everyone is friendly with everyone. It was good to talk with two Lithuanians who had hiked all the way up to the top with their backpacks a solo French traveller and a former US marine who now works teaching children with special educational needs in Chicago. Very interesting. They had all however walked all the way up to the top so I felt a bit of a cheat having taken the ropeways up most of the way… I did walk all the way back down again though! Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Bridge near Kure Port This was a sweltering steep descent for just over an hour but through stunning lush primeval forest – although it was really hot and I sweated buckets it was very much worth it to once more experience the beauty sounds and serenity of the Japanese forest. I was slightly perturbed by signs all the way down warning hikers of deadly vipers in the area though I arrived back at the bottom fortunately not having encountered one. Passing the stunning torii gate once more and for the last time I hopped on the ferry back over to the mainland and then bumped into the French guy Gautier again at the train station who I shared the journey back to Hiroshima train station with. I am currently writing this one up after having taken a well-needed shower turning the air-conditioning on full-blast and having my clothes laundered five floors below me in the coin laundry room feeling very clean once more after a really very enjoyable if very sweaty day on the beautiful island of Miyajima. I am looking forward to a cold beer after publishing this blog entry followed by a delicious spaghetti bolognese microwave meal and a final night Matsuyama to Hiroshima Ferry Arriving in Hiroshima here in Hiroshima. Tomorrow I plan to take my final shinkansen train on this journey sniff… and then a local train called Sonic” should be interesting! to my next destination the popular Japanese onsen town of Beppu on the volcanic island of Kyushu west of here. I plan to write up my next blog entry either from Beppu or from Fukuoka shortly after. I have really enjoyed my time here in Hiroshima. On the one hand it has been emotive and moving and definitely a learning experience on the other it has been another fantastic place that I have visited on this wonderful journey that I am thoroughly enjoying in Japan. My prior two joint-favourite countries of Brazil and Turkey may have met their match at their top spot with Japan – for me my favourite countries are those which are both beautiful and also have very friendly and welcoming people. Japan seems to be fulfilling these two criteria completely! So until the next time I wish everyone all the best! Thank you for reading and take care.

Especially when it came to things belonging to children such as a scorched tricycle. The origami cranes of Sadako Sasasi and her friends honouring her dying efforts also hit me very hard. This is one of those places together with Auswitch which I think everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. 3rd August 2018 alex waring Alexander Waring Emotional Indeed my friend. I also had a lump in my throat and a few tears in my eyes. I also believe in the importance of visiting places like this. 3rd August 2018 D MJ Binkley Dave and Merry Jo Binkley Tough visits but a needed perspective As we isit locations like this we come with pre-conceived notions and a bit of history but we often learn so much in addition to what we thought we knew. Always several sides to these complex issues. This part of the world leads one to contemplation. It is somber Im sure. When we were in Hells Gate Thailand our guide thanked us for the bombing. He said America saved many thousands of lives of his countrymen. It was odd being thanked for that but it made us think about his perspective. Im always puzzeled when faced with mans inhumanity to its fellow man. The Tori Gate looks beautiful and we hope to see it some day. Thanks for taking us along. 4th August 2018 alex waring Alexander Waring Perspectives Indeed it is important I think to consider all perspectives the issue of the bombing is highly complex and I find there is no easy answer. I have my opinion it is good to learn that of others. Interesting to hear your story from Thailand. The Floating Torii and magical Miyajima Island were a wonderful diversion from the emotion. 3rd August 2018 Home and Away Bob Carlsen Thanks for sharing your thought and emotions... in this iconic place where horror was necessary to stop even more horror. 4th August 2018 alex waring Alexander Waring Emotive Thank you for this a good summary I think also of my opinion. It was tragic but I believe it had to happen to prevent further tragedy.

Reply Gabriel April 16 2017 at 1201 am As someone who has only been to Europe once on a trip that I neither planned nor paid for as a minor this is inspiring and makes me want to plan a new trip of my own. I’m a college student so your comments about Switzerland being one of the more expensive destinations is unfortunate but I think I could justify spending a little extra to be back in my favorite place on Earth. I think I may have to add Mt. Pilatus to my list of places to go… haven’t done enough mountain hiking/climbing in my life.

Reply Josh May 3 2017 at 854 am Hi Matt This guide is great! I really want to go and backpack around Europe when I get older and I will keep these tips in mind. Someone told me about youth hostels in Europe and how they are a cheap place to stay. I have gone once before and haven’t done much backpacking there yet but it is amazing. The hardest part for me is going to Europe and not spend too much money. I loved all the tips you gave and hopefully can someday go and backpack across the European countryside. What do you think the best Country is to backpack around? Reply Sahil Aliyev May 4 2017 at 412 am It’s great what you are doing and I hope that you can continue to provide the students with life long memories. Reply Pallavi May 11 2017 at 646 am Last year I went backpacking in India. And what an absolutely fantastic time I had there. I had read an article about backpacking in India which was like a guide to me. It was fun I was there for a month and covered almost all the major places across the country. Most of the places especially major cities have a very good connectivity to all parts of the country. I had pre-booked most of my places and had decided on the itinerary prior to my departure. I did not wish to carry around a lot of luggage. Inside the cities I was able to travel easily because of goof transportation system. Or sometimes if I felt like it I would just rent a bike and roam around the city all night by myself or sometimes even embark on short journeys to nearby places. One such trip I remember is to this place called Coorg nearby to Mysore. I took a bike on rent from this company called wwwdotwheelstreetdotcom from Mysore and had visited this place. It has been one to my trip and this blog has now gotten me excited about a backpacking trip to Europe. I might as well start planning soon for this. Reply Hiren P February 25 2019 at 135 pm Make sure Day-wise itinerary as you witness the route. backpacking to any destination is one of the favorite things to as a any traveler. when i was backpacking to my most adventures tour as ladakh and now i am packing my bag for Sikkim i am too exciting and imagining that how the place would be and would really adventures as my past trip … wooh..

From ancient structures like the Colosseum or the Pantheon to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain to the Vatican — not to mention tons of pasta and other delicious food — it has it all. But planning a trip to Rome can sometimes be a pain. Where should you stay? What are the best neighborhoods? Rome is huge. It has 15 municipi administrative areas with the city center municipio alone divided into 22 smaller districts. Whether you’re after a more historical area or something more local-feeling or whether you are keen to experience great Italian food or Roman nightlife there is a neighborhood in this amazing city to suit you. To help you figure that out here are some of my extensive thoughts on the best places to stay during your time in Rome based on my years of experience visiting there 1. Trastevere Trastevere is filled with narrow cobblestone alleyways that run past buildings decorated with tangled ivy and vines. It makes you feel like you’re back in a medieval city. For many centuries Trastevere was a working-class district but in recent years it’s become a bohemian hotspot for foodies and tourists wanting to see beyond Rome’s big-name attractions. At night you can mingle in the Piazza di Santa Maria with crowds of young locals and students enjoying the nightlife eating and drinking. And if you climb the nearby steps of Gianicolo Hill you’ll reach a spot with views across Rome including the Pantheon and the Capitoline Hills. Best places to stay in Trastevere BUDGET Hostel Trastevere – This hostel close to grocery stores and public transit has a great outdoor terrace common area with shade sails to keep you cooler in summer and a cheap buffet breakfast as well as fast Wi-Fi and air-conditioning. Rooms sleep a maximum of five people. The beds are comfortable too. MID-RANGE Trastevere’s Friends – This B&B is quiet with spacious double rooms making it especially popular with couples. The rooms here are light and bright and most include ample wardrobe space for unpacking. The place is clean and the owners and staff are extra-friendly. LUXURY Trastevere Royal Suite Trilussa – This luxury hotel has views over the Tiber River and is central to all the amazing restaurants and cafés of Trastevere. Each room is uniquely decorated with paintings or ornate mirrors. Breakfast is included in your room price. 2. Monti The very oldest part of Rome is Monti which is full of winding cobblestone streets and antique stores. Local residents are often creative types and they’ve made sure there are plenty of quirky cafés intimate bars and independent businesses for you to explore. You can wander the streets past endless shades of pastel-colored walls and browse the clothes and jewelry at the Mercato Monti vintage market. Best places to stay in Monti BUDGET Palladini Hostel Rome – This might be a hostel but it hasn’t skimped on the décor with stylish black- red- and white-themed communal areas and artwork and chandeliers in the private rooms. It’s just 200m from Termini station so it’s really easy to access any public transport option you might want. BUDGET Hostel Alessandro Downtown – Cleanliness a friendly staff and a social atmosphere make this a good choice. It’s a great place to stay if you want to meet other travelers either in the hostel itself or the bar which is popular with many backpackers exploring Rome. MID-RANGE Apollo Rooms Colosseo – Clean and new with friendly owners and a gelato bar at the back of the building this property has a vibe that makes up for the fairly small but tastefully decorated rooms. LUXURY Monti Palace Hotel – This stylish hotel includes a wholesome buffet breakfast and a rooftop bar with gorgeous views of the city. The rooms are spacious sleek and well lit. 3. Prati Prati is close to St Peter’s Square and the Vatican — it shares a border with the northern end of the Vatican State — and includes Via Cola di Rienzo which is one of the most well-known shopping streets in the city for high-end brands. Prati is also an area where you’re less likely to find hordes of tourists and it’s great for imagining what life would be like if you were a wealthy Roman. Best places to stay in Prati BUDGET Arts & Rooms – This is a great budget option with fast Wi-Fi and a communal kitchen filled with snacks guests get use of the coffee machine too. It’s elegant with simple but tasteful furnishings. MID-RANGE Luxury on the River – Despite its name this place comes at a mid-range price and is located in a historic building overlooking the river. It has helpful staff and a varied breakfast plus the rooms are quite large. There’s real Italian flare to the décor and a cozy lounge and library. LUXURY Hotel NH Collection Roma Giustiniano – This four-star hotel with spacious rooms is a great value. All its rooms have gorgeous parquet floors and many have balconies with great views. There’s also a small gym and a restaurant on-site. 4. Ostiense Ostiense is a half-hour bus ride south of the center of Rome but it’s a great neighborhood for a less touristy experience. Formerly an industrial area it’s had a hipster makeover and is famous for its street art food and nightlife. On Via Giuseppe Libetta you’ll find many of Rome’s best nightclubs and music venues. There’s even history here the ancient Pyramid of Cestius made of white marble blocks. Best places to stay in Ostiense BUDGET Verrazzano 37 Guest House – This small place offers four comfortable rooms with modern furniture a shared kitchen and free Wi-Fi and is right near a 24-hour grocery store. It has nice double rooms making it especially popular with couples on a budget. MID-RANGE Gasometer Urban Suites – Created out of a former factory in 2018 this spot features stylish and spacious rooms and you can access a shared rooftop terrace with great views and also a gym. LUXURY Sheraton Roma Hotel – This luxury hotel and conference center has a fabulous pool area and is great for a summer stay especially with kids. It’s less Italian in style than other accommodations in Rome but makes up for it with spacious quiet rooms and excellent breakfasts. There’s a lot of garden greenery and even a small wooded area surrounding the hotel so it feels like you’re much further from central Rome than you actually are. 5. Testaccio Testaccio a 20-minute walk south of the Colosseum is an edgier district a former slaughterhouse area now adored by foodies. It’s not necessarily full of Instagram-worthy architecture but it’s really got heart. There are a bunch of art museums and other sightseeing spots in Testaccio but the best reason to stay here is the food from the Testaccio Market with its gourmet street food stalls to spots like Da Remo which many people claim has the best traditional pizza in Rome. Best places to stay in Testaccio BUDGET I-sleep B&B – This budget accommodation is in a really convenient location but it’s still reasonably quiet. A light breakfast is included with your room rate. Most rooms are decorated in a modern black-and-white style and are clean and comfortable. MID-RANGE 149 Guesthouse – Really helpful staff make a stay here great and the espresso machines and jacuzzis are also a bonus. It’s in a classy building rooms with balconies look over the leafy trees along the street. If you’re there on a Sunday make sure you check out the outdoor Porta Portese flea market nearby. LUXURY Seven Suites – You’ll get very good value for these spacious modern rooms and a good breakfast in the café at the front. It’s recently renovated with classy bathrooms and really comfortable memory-foam beds. It’s a small property with just six rooms so it’s quiet. 6. Pigneto Less than a 15-minute tram ride from the center of Rome Pigneto is a colorful neighborhood full of interesting graffiti street art and murals that’s had a hipster makeover in recent years. Some people call it the Brooklyn of Rome and I think that’s a fair description! It’s filling up with trendy bars and restaurants and often gets labeled Bohemian although it’s a real mix of small older homes and new apartment buildings. It’s also home to lots of small cocktail bars and cafés and other great spots for some people-watching. Best places to stay in Pigneto BUDGET Relais Villa Fiorelli – This is located in a quiet spot on the Piazza di Villa Fiorelli. It has simple modern rooms with free Wi-Fi some with balconies looking over the lush garden. Room rates include breakfast served either in your room or outside in the garden. The recent addition of the new Line C Lodi metro station makes it even easier to get into central Rome from here. MID-RANGE Eurostars Roma Aeterna – Right on the Piazza del Pigneto this hotel is in a former pharmaceutical factory. Inside rooms are decorated with minimalist but stylish décor and photography. It offers a great breakfast and there’s a well-equipped free gym too. LUXURY Hotel Latinum – This boutique hotel of just twelve rooms has a special glass floor so you can see what lies under it thanks to some archaeological excavation — a great way to remind you of the history of Rome even when you’re back in the hotel. It’s an elegant spot with beautiful wooden furniture and the rooftop terrace is a good place to relax. 7. Tridente The Tridente area has plenty of tourists coming to see the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps but there’s also amazing shopping and fancy hotels and restaurants. Strolling back to your accommodation in Tridente you’ll pass historic sites old architecture and endless options for dining. Staying here means you might not get a particularly local feel for what it’s like to live in Rome but you’ll be near many of the places you’ll want to visit and you’ll get a taste for where wealthy Romans live. Best places to stay in Tridente BUDGET Crispi Relax – Less than a five-minute walk from the Spanish Steps this guesthouse is great value for such a central location with clean air-conditioned rooms though they’re relatively small not surprising for the area. Some rooms have balconies for some extra space and you can take in the views of what’s happening right there in the center of the city. MID-RANGE Condotti Hotel – Also just around the corner from the Spanish Steps Hotel Condotti is a small and elegant boutique hotel with an entrance off a quiet street beautiful décor and lots of added extras. If you’re traveling with kids you can stay in the adjacent building in suites made of two connecting double bedrooms. LUXURY Hotel d’Inghilterra Roma – This hotel close to the Spanish Steps and the Via del Corso shopping street located in a beautiful 16th-century building offers affordable luxury compared to some really pricey places in this part of town. The staff are very attentive and the hotel restaurant Café Romano gets rave reviews. Each of its 88 rooms is decorated with its own style and charm. 8. Parioli Parioli is a largely residential quieter part of Rome but is less than a half-hour ride by metro or bus into the center. It’s full of gardens and parks and its southern boundary runs along the Villa Borghese gardens. It’s typically home to some affluent locals with classy-looking apartment buildings and if you’re planning a longer stay it’s a great base that offers a taste of semi-suburban life in Rome. Best places to stay in Parioli BUDGET Hotel Delle Muse – This family-run hotel offers free Wi-Fi and an on-site restaurant. There’s a large covered terrace garden where you can eat lunch and dinner. The staff are really helpful and there’s a bus stop nearby. Rooms are fairly small and a little dated but it’s a clean and comfortable place at a good price. MID-RANGE Parioli Place B&B – Friendly staff great breakfast and modern black-and-white interiors make this a solid mid-range choice. The roof garden is a lovely spot and you can opt to eat breakfast up there too. LUXURY Hotel Lord Byron – This is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World yet is actually great value. The marble bathrooms are decadent and the mahogany and rosewood furniture lends a completely charming art deco atmosphere — you’ll feel a little like you’re sleeping in a gallery. The hotel also has a lounge bar and the award-winning restaurant Sapori del Lord Byron. 9. San Lorenzo If you want to stay somewhere with a student vibe then San Lorenzo is it near the Sapienza University and walking distance east of the city center. The neighborhood was bombed heavily in World War II and was never rebuilt quite as well as other areas but what San Lorenzo lacks in prettiness it makes up for with fun. There are lots of shopping options both for new Italian fashion and vintage clothes great cheap pizza and cool bars. Head to the Via dei Volsci and Via dei Sabelli to see where the young people of Rome enjoy a night out. Best places to stay in San Lorenzo BUDGET The Yellow – Situated on the university side of the central Termini railway station this hostel is popular with backpackers looking for a party atmosphere and it has local live music in its bar. There are other added extras like yoga sessions on the rooftop or on-site Italian cooking and pasta-making classes. The staff are really friendly and responsive and the place often ranks highly in votes on Rome’s best hostel stay. BUDGET Alessandro Palace Hostel – This hostel offers lots of extras like a rooftop bar with shady spaces to sit and relax a gym and two restaurants. The dorm rooms are quite roomy. MID-RANGE Hotel Laurentia – Right in the liveliest part of San Lorenzo this hotel has fine rooms and a delicious breakfast. The rooms ranging from singles to quadruples are spacious for the price with a simple but elegant look. The dining area is quite different with large brick arches dividing it into somewhat separate sections for some privacy. LUXURY Hotel Royal Court – A very good value this four-star hotel on the Termini Station side of San Lorenzo has an art nouveau look with wood flooring and period furniture and many of the rooms have really unique furnishings. The rooms and bathrooms are large the quadruple rooms are a great option for family trips. *** Rome is a big city with lots to see and experience so figuring out which neighborhood will work best for you is partly about deciding whether you want to indulge in regular restaurant meals or nightlife or be near plenty of the historical sights or try some more local neighborhoods for a when in Rome” kind of experience. If you have a longer stay you can always consider starting in one of the inner city neighborhoods while you see the most famous sights then having a few days a little further out to enjoy shopping and dining among locals.

And you’ll hear fantastical tales from history and folklore from people who still believe that elves might exist. It’s one of my favorite countries in the world one I fell in love with the first time I visited. I’ve been back multiple times since then during various seasons. But Iceland isn’t always easy to get around especially in the off-season when many bus routes shut down because of weather. One of the ways to get around that problem is by joining an organized tour. You’ll get to experience places that can be inaccessible without a four-wheel drive and you’ll have local knowledge to help make the most of your day depending on the ever-changing and often extreme weather. I’ve put together a list of my favorite tour companies in Iceland from short city walking tours to multiday adventure hikes. A lot of tour companies aren’t cheap there and you’ll definitely pay more than if you were to do the same route solo but here are the seven that provide incredible experiences at the right price 1. Follow Me – Free Walking Tour Reykjavik A free walking tour is always a great way to introduce yourself to a new city and the guides from Follow Me can give you a good overview of Iceland’s capital on this 90-minute stroll. It runs three city walking tours a day in peak season June to September and one a day the rest of the year it also now offers an Old Harbour and Brewery tour every afternoon. The Reykjavik walking tours have been running since 2012 and the guides are all local comedians and entertainers who love the city and want to make you laugh while you’re exploring it. They’ll show you some more overlooked parts of town and also give you some tips for saving money in this expensive country. Like many free walking tours most guests tip the guide what they feel the tour was worth at the end. —-> Click here to learn more about Follow Me – Free Walking Tour Reykjavik! 2. Ride with Locals Ride with Locals is a motorcycle tour company that will take you to the middle of nowhere on trails you wouldn’t access any other way meaning you’ll see volcanoes craters and mountains that very few visitors to Iceland do making your Iceland experience particularly unique. Its trips last between three days and a week and generally head inland rather than hugging the coast like most tours. The motorcycles are KTM 690R and Husqvarna 701 dual sport bikes and all guides are really experienced with riding through Iceland’s highlands. Some trips use sleeping bags in mountain huts for accommodations and include all the meals while others include hotel stays with breakfast. Costs range between about $2800 and $5000 including motorbike hire and fuel depending on the length of the trip. —-> Click here to learn more about Ride with Locals! 3. Intrepid Intrepid’s tour offerings are always solid using small groups and local guides and they don’t rush you from sight to sight. It offers a number of options in Iceland including the classic Ring Road trip where you circumnavigate the island and get to visit some of the best-known sights from the glacier lagoon at Jökulsárlón on the south coast to the volcanic lake at Mývatn in the north. There’s also a six-day camping trip along the southern coast. Intrepid tours start at $1000 and go up to $4600 for the ten-day comfort tour. —-> Click here to learn more about Intrepid! 4. Arctic Adventures/Trek Iceland/Extreme Iceland Arctic Adventures is a big player in the Iceland tour market these days and offers a huge range of one-day and multiday tours as well as helping you out with self-drive tour arrangements. It’s owned by the same people who run Trek Iceland and Extreme Iceland two other tour companies that essentially run all the same tours as Arctic Adventures. Its one-day tour options include all the main Icelandic sightseeing activities like ice caves snorkeling glacier tours and the popular Golden Circle route to Thingvellir National Park the Geysir hot springs and Gullfoss Waterfall. They have mutli-day trips as well. Arctic Adventures’ full-day trips range in price from around $100 to $160 depending on the need for equipment or smaller groups for the more adventurous activities. —-> Click here to learn more about Arctic Adventures! 5. Icelandic Mountains Guides For 25 years Icelandic Mountain Guides has focused on true adventure travel with very small groups. Its multiday tours include more unique routes like a five-day backpacking trek from Núpsstaðaskógur to Skaftafell or a ten-day expedition across the Highlands starting from the northern town of Akureyri these longer trips will set you back upwards of $4000. It also runs one-day tours to ice caves and glacier walk experiences among others leaving from Reykjavík along with similar one-day adventures on the Sólheimajökull glacier on the south coast if you’re in the area and can meet them there. The half-day and one-day tours are generally pricier than other companies from $100 and up for half-day excursions but often include specialist equipment or ride on quad bikes or snowmobiles. Icelandic Mountain Guides has a genuine conservation focus and holds a twice-yearly event where guides spend time planting trees. Its current aim is to increase its carbon-offset programs so that its multiday tours are also carbon neutral. —-> Click here to learn more about Icelandic Mountains Guides! 6. Iceland Horizon Iceland Horizon offers a huge ariety of single-day tours all around the country. They’re a good choice for travelers who want to see the main sights and do fun activities but who don’t have access to their own vehicle. They run their small-group tours always under 19 people from a mini-bus which has Wi-Fi making it a comfortable way to see the sights without having to bother with renting your own car. They also run multi-day trips ranging from 3-7 days that cover all the best highlights of the country including Northern Lights tours and tours around the Snaefellsness peninsula. Expect to pay around 11000 ISK per person for a day trip and upwards of 30000 ISK per person for a three-day tour. —-> Click here to learn more about Iceland Horizon! 7. Midgard Adventures Based in Southern Iceland Midgard Adventures is a family-owned company that offers all sorts of fun and adventurous tours. Offroading with jeeps fat bike tours hiking snowmobiling and glacier walks are all on offer here with tours led by family friends and local guides. Midgard also has its own hotel in Hvolsöllur that you can base yourself from complete with restaurant bar hot tubs and a sauna Hvolsöllur is around 90 minutes southeast of Reykjavik. They have both single-day tours as well as multi-day tours that stretch from 2-8 days including seasonally-exclusive tours such as offroading in the Highlands during winter.

I’d wanted to visit Colombia for years. And after spending six weeks there I must say it lived up to the hype. I mean I’ve been fawning over it a lot in my last few posts. And I know I’m the millionth blogger to do so but it really is as incredible as people say. Even getting knifed there couldn’t stop me from loving the country. I had falsely assumed that six weeks would be enough to get a good sense of Colombia. After all six weeks is a fair amount of time to spend anywhere. But I was wrong. Given its size and the sheer number of activities it was barely enough to scratch the surface. Yet I did manage to see a lot. Today I want to share my list of what I think are the best things to see and do in Colombia. These are the activities and places you should try to focus on when you visit 1. Cartagena Cartagena is one of the most visited destinations in Colombia thanks to a lot of direct flights and cruise ship visits. Dating back to 1533 the city is famed for its colonial Old Town a maze of cobbled alleys flower-covered balconies and giant churches on spacious plazas. But despite the crowds and there are a lot of crowds I really enjoyed Cartagena. While there aren’t a lot of tourist activities you can do most of them in a single day what makes it a wonderful place to visit is just that it’s somewhere you can slow down relax and gorge on the phenomenal gastronomy. For more check out this blog post about Cartegena and all my favorite places to eat there. 2. Tayrona National Park Located on Colombia’s Caribbean coast Tayrona has long stretches of golden beaches lined with coconut palms and a dense rainforest with lots of easy day hikes. You’ll also find campsites for overnight stays hammocks for rent restaurants diving and horse riding. It’s easy to visit as a day trip from Santa Marta. I highly suggest you start early at the big entrance at El Zaino and exit the park through Calabazo. This underused route takes a whole day and once you pass the Cabo San Juan campground you’ll get the last half of the trail to yourself. Try to avoid visiting during January and weekends when the crowds on the beaches and hiking paths are at their peak. 3. The Lost City La Ciudad Perdida The Lost City was built around 800 CE and contains 169 terraces carved into the mountains as well as a network of tiled roads and small plazas. It’s one of the most beautiful treks in the country and the site is older than Machu Picchu! To visit you need to hire a tour operator you can’t do it by yourself. It’s about $300-350 USD for the trek from Santa Marta through the jungle up to these beautiful ruins and takes 4–6 days. If you’re pressed for time you can also do it in three days the only difference is the pace you go at. Tip You cross a lot of rivers so be sure to bring an extra pair of shoes or flip flops for when you cross the rivers. You’ll easily ruin a pair of sneakers along the way. 4. Salento Surrounded by green mountains and coffee farms this is one of the oldest towns in the coffee-growing region and the most popular for travelers. The houses are painted a variety of vibrant colors and the high vantage points throughout town provide some stunning views sunsets are quite magical. There’s not much to do in the city itself — it’s simply a base for coffee tours or hiking the Cocora Valley see below or the trails around town — so it’s easy to spend a few days here watching the world go by with a good book in hand. 5. Cocora Valley The Cocora Valley is home to Colombia’s national tree the wax palm which grows to nearly 200 feet tall. This area has probably the most popular day hike in the country which was also my favorite activity during my entire trip. You’ll cross jungle rivers visit a bird sanctuary and enjoy some stellar views and forest scenery. The route’s about five hours and you can choose to either take the clockwise or counterclockwise route. The clockwise route starting at the Wax Palm Valley is easier with fewer hills. Counterclockwise is easier at the end though a little anticlimactic as you end the hike walking down a boring road. Tip Start early to avoid the brutal midday heat since there are a lot of exposed areas here. 6. Bogotá Bogotá is Colombia’s vibrant capital. While it’s not the country’s most popular destination it felt the most Colombian” to me there was just a certain edge and charm to it and it seemed the least touristy with the fewest gringo expats. The historic downtown La Candelaria is filled with bright colonial buildings detailed museums delicious restaurants tiny fun bars historic churches and centuries-old houses. The north end of town is home to boutique hotels and entertainment areas like Zona Rosa and Zona G. The foodie scene in the city is incredible with a lot of international options and cutting-edge gastronomic happenings. Throw in some amazing walking tours day trips and hikes and you’ve got a recipe for an astounding city. For more here’s a list of all my favorite things to do – and places to eat – in Bogota. 7. Cali This hot hot city is the salsa capital of the world where people come to dance. A lot of the guests at my hostel had been there for weeks to learn the hostels also offer free dance classes. If you like to dance you can’t miss this city. Besides dancing though there are a number of parks museums and churches you can visit plus free walking and food tours. While I didn’t stay long I definitely enjoyed the scene. 8. Popayán Popayán rivals Cartagena as Colombia’s most impressive colonial town. It’s known as La Ciudad Blanca The White City” because all the buildings are painted white. Popayán is also a college town there are three universities and it’s produced 17 presidents too! Though small I really loved the slow pace of life and the surprisingly robust food scene here eat at La Cosecha Parrillada Restaurante Italiano y Pizzeria La Fresa and Mora de Castilla. While you don’t need a lot of time take the walking tour climb the hill see the churches and you’re done I do suggest staying longer to enjoy the slow pace of life. So much of Colombia is go-go-go it’s nice to find a place that’s more stay and relax a while.” 9. Tatacoa Desert Millions of years ago it was once a lush tropical forest. Now Tatacoa Desert is filled with rocky canyons in shades of red and gray. It is also home to one of the most important observatories in South America where you can gaze at the stars weather permitting. If you want to be blown away by the universe you really need to see this place! Other than that there’s not much here. Bike into the desert take some walks stare at the sky. Stay a night or two. It’s not a popular area but it is a picturesque way to break up the long bus ride from Bogotá to the south or vice versa. 10. San Agustín Archaeological Park A UNESCO World Heritage Site San Agustín is a small mountain town that’s home to hundreds of pre-Columbian statues and burial mounds. Its collection of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures is the largest in Latin America for which you’ll need at least one full day two to really see it all in depth. If you love history this is probably the best spot in all of Colombia to experience it. 11. San Gil San Gil is considered the outdoors capital of the country. Extreme-sports fans love it here. You can go white-water rafting paragliding caving rappelling trekking and more from this city! This city is a great place to do outdoor activities and you’re going to find a lot of tour operators in the city. Try to plan at least three days here. It’s worth it. 12. Providencia and San Andrés Islands These islands are actually closer to Nicaragua than Colombia. They are also considered some of the most unspoiled places in the Caribbean. You’ll find white-sand beaches stunningly clear blue water and few crowds though thanks to some recent press Providencia is becoming a lot busier. Try to make it when tens of thousands of black crabs migrate to the sea. This happens twice a year for about a 1-2-week period between April and July so it’s not always easy to nail the timing. 13. Medellín In a country full of hype this hyped-up city is all that it’s cracked up to be. Set in the Aburrá Valley Medellín is one of the fastest-growing cities in Colombia. It has enough activities and things to do to fill weeks on end from microbreweries museums walking tours spacious parks street art food tours and markets to incredible nightlife and on and on and on. It’s one of the most popular destinations for expats and tourists in the country. While it’s easy to get lost in Gringoland here try to get out of Poblado or Laureles and see the locals’ side of town. There’s more to the city than those two areas! 14. Guatapé This pueblo is one of the most picturesque towns in Colombia and one of the most colorful in the world as most of the traditional homes have murals painted on the bottom half of their façades that depict animals people and shapes. Just hanging out in one of the bright plazas drinking coffee and people-watching is one of the most pleasant things to do here. Most people though come to climb the steep and difficult staircase to the top of the monolithic Rock of Guatapé La Piedra for some of the best views in the country. Guatapé is a long day trip from Medellín hostels in the city organize them throughout the week so I recommend trying to spend at least a night here so you aren’t as rushed and can enjoy the area little more. 15. Chingaza National Park This is one of the biggest nature reserves in Colombia home to more than 1000 plant species and 187 bird species. Here you’ll learn about the Páramo ecosystem and how it affects the global water system. Fun fact Nearly 80% of Bogotá’s water supply comes from Chingaza. If you’re going to hike joining a tour is a good idea. The guides are usually naturalists who can explain the unique environment of the area. One of the best routes is the challenging hike to the summit of Lagunas de Siecha with a great view over the lakes. 16. Barranquilla Located between Santa Marta and Cartagena Barranquilla is the spot to be during Carnival the second biggest in Latin America. It starts on a Sunday with the Battle of Flowers a big parade and the coronation of the King and Queen. But there’s a lot to do here when it’s not carnival season as well. Make sure you visit El Museo del Caribe a museum offering an interesting insight into the history of Colombia’s Caribbean coast. There’s also a special exhibit dedicated to Gabriel García Márquez the famous author who wrote Love in the Time of Cholera. 17. Tierradentro Tierradentro is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America. It’s up there with San Agustín but gets less press since it’s located in the middle of nowhere and not on a main road. It contains over 100 hypogea underground tombs dating from the sixth to the tenth centuries the only examples of their kind in the Americas. It takes a day or two to hike all the paths around the tombs. You can hire a guide if you want but the trails are pretty easy to do on your own. 18. Manizales and Los Nevados On the road from Medellín to the south is the city of Manizales. Here you can take some tours at this northern point of the coffee-growing region or roam around town which has some decent restaurants and churches and a scenic gondola ride. The main reason people visit is to hike Los Nevados a mountain range with majestic snow-capped peaks. You can do a day or multi-day hikes but whatever you do don’t rush up to the top — acclimatize yourself to the altitude in Manizales for a few days first. The town is 2000 meters 6500 feet above sea level but mountains are about 6000 meters 19700 feet! I wasn’t climatized and could really feel the altitude just walking around town. Don’t push yourself if you want to do the hike. 19. The Caribbean Coast The beaches on the Caribbean coast might not win any awards at least in my opinion but the sleepy towns reminded me a lot of the tiny backpacker beach villages around Southeast Asia a dirt road lots of hostels a relaxed atmosphere and not much else to do. I could easily see why people end up getting stuck here for weeks at a time. The best beach towns to visit are Costeño Beach and Palomino. 20. Punta Gallinas Punta Gallinas is the northernmost point in all of South America. Most people come here via a tour from Santa Marta or Cabo de Vela with the latter through La Guajira Desert being the better option if you just want to take your time and relax because it’s closer so there’s a lot less drive time. In fact the only way to see the area is via a tour. Most are two or three nights depending on where you’re coming from. Any hostel can organize a trip for you. 21. Minca Minca is located in the foothills of the Sierra de Santa Marta Mountains. Once a sleepy backpacker town it’s now a hot spot for tourists escaping the oppressive heat on the Caribbean coast and hoping to do some quiet hikes. One of the best hikes is to Los Pinos but it isn’t easy it takes about three hours from the center of town and it’s a steady climb into the mountains but like all things like this it’s worth it. There are a lot of waterfalls in the area as well. Two of the best are the Pozo Azul and Marinka. Both have swimming holes at them too. Be sure to check out the sunset Mundo Nuevo Hostel. It’s an amazing vantage point. *** Colombia has a million and one things to do. I lost track of all the places I kept wishing I had time to visit. You can spend months there and a lot of people to do. However I think this list is a great start. My recommendation is that if you’re short on time fly the bus rides are long or just stick to one area of the country and go in depth around that region. Trying to see it all” in Colombia is just a recipe for burnout! Book Your Trip to Colombia Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. I use them all the time. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.

Tokyo does hostels right. I’ve been visiting Tokyo for years now and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Tokyo are Location – Tokyo is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Tokyo you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

Sheena and Ippei Sheena and Ippei is a small hostel located in downtown Tokyo near the Ikebukuro station.

Hostel Chapter Two Tokyo Chapter Two is a small family-run hostel not far from Skytree Station in Asakusa. I really like the shared kitchen and common room as there’s a real social feel to it. The dorms are modern immaculate and nicely equipped. You can book a deluxe pod which gives you a partitioned-off bed with a privacy curtain which is a nice change from the open-concept dorm. There’s also a great view of the Sumida River — try to get a bed facing it! The rooftop patio comes with a co-working area and it’s a terrific option for relaxing and hanging out.

There’s a sunny comfortable common area near the entrance and a regularly scheduled sushi-making class where you can make some new friends. Breakfast isn’t included but there’s a full kitchen with free coffee and tea. It’s not exactly in the center of Tokyo so plan on spending at least 30 minutes to get to and from the hostel. Still it’s a nice neighborhood and a good place to stay if you’re feeling overwhelmed by Tokyo’s craziness. Backpackers Hostel K’s House Tokyo at a Glance $ Huge common room makes it easy to meet people Female-only dorms for extra privacy and security Discounts for staying at other K’s House hostels Beds from JP¥ 2900/$26 USD privates from JP¥ 4600/$42 USD. —> Book your stay at Backpackers Hostel K’s House Tokyo 8.

CITAN Hostel CITAN is a hipster paradise in the Nihonbashi area and what I would call a boutique” hostel. The building is seven stories with 130 beds everything is kept clean and the showers have strong water pressure. The common area on the first floor is a relaxed hangout and there’s a good kitchen for cooking. There’s also an amazing coffee shop Berth Coffee on the first floor and a bar and restaurant in the basement. This bar is packed on weekends and not just with hostel guests there is also usually a DJ on Saturday nights. Because of this it doesn’t have that much of a hostel vibe. But the neighborhood is peaceful so you’ll get a good night’s sleep. CITAN Hostel at a Glance $ Quiet neighborhood so you’ll get a good sleep Bar restaurant and cafe all on-site so it’s easy to meet people Great showers awesome water pressure Beds from JP¥ 3000/$27 USD privates from JP¥ 9000/$82 USD. —> Book your stay at CITAN Hostel 10.

I have told you everything you need to know about traveling as a lesbian and how to plan the perfect lesbian-friendly trip but what about lesbian-friendly destinations? What are the greatest locations for an unforgettable lesbian vacation — where you don’t have to be afraid to get weird stares or have to be careful with PDAs if you’re with your partner. There are dozens of spots that fit the bill some of which became more interesting at certain times Lesbos became popular with gay women when the Sappho Women’s Festival was created in 2000 Los Angeles saw an increase in lesbian travelers when The L Word first aired in 2004 and Madrid was particularly popular with queer visitors during 2017 WorldPride. So which destinations are having their lesbian moment” in 2019? Here are five that welcome LGBT travelers and have something that makes them particularly interesting for lesbians now no matter if you’re traveling solo or with your significant other. Read on for why I think you should hit up one of them this year 1. New York City USA Why go? New York City is not only known as one of the gay-friendliest cities in the world and the top-ranked LGBTQ destination in the US but it is where the Stonewall riots kicked off the modern gay liberation movement in 1969. 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of this significant event in LGBT culture and to commemorate New York City will host WorldPride in June — the Pride of Prides a full month of festivities with over 50 events. It’s the first time in its 20-year history that WorldPride is being held in the United States and many celebrities are expected to join the festivities including Madonna who rang in the 50th anniversary year with a surprise performance at the historic Stonewall Inn bar on New Year’s Eve. While this is a great excuse to visit NYC this year there are many more things that make the city attractive for lesbian tourists — from world-class art museums to stunning Broadway productions and dozens of neighborhoods to explore New York City is always worth a visit. In the summer you will get to enjoy free performances by the New York Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic in the city’s parks free outdoor movie screenings and weekend flea markets and food markets. Check out Matt’s 3-day NYC itinerary that covers all of the city’s famous sights and museums. You’ll also want to check out New York’s lesbian nightlife including the iconic Cubbyhole Bar and Henrietta Hudson in the West Village the popular Hot Rabbit party and a number of Pride parties exclusively for women such as the Femme Fatale rooftop party. If you want to learn more about the LGBT history of New York I recommend this informative LGBTQ History Walking Tour of Greenwich Village. When to go June. The biggest event World Pride Parade takes place on Sunday June 30 2019. Before you go Check out the lesbian events calendar before you visit NYC. There are regular lesbian stand-up comedy shows dance parties and exquisite drag shows. Events like lesbian speed dating or a comedy show are especially great if you are traveling solo. 2. Montreal Canada Why go? Canada legalized same-sex marriage in 2005 and has been a popular destination for LGBT-travelers ever since and while cities like Vancouver Toronto or Quebec are all LGBT-friendly  Montreal is known as the city with the biggest LGBT nightlife scene and is particularly lesbian-friendly unlike most other popular LGBT destinations which usually focus on male clientele. The favorable exchange rate of the Canadian dollar right now also means that a trip there is not too expensive. Rue Sainte-Catherine is where most of Montreal’s gay nightlife is centered and it’s the center of the village” Montreal’s gayborhood. Sadly the infamous Le Drugstore a lesbian bar on eight floors closed down but there are still plenty of amazing nightclubs. Don’t miss Complexe Sky the biggest gay club in all of Canada whose four floors each have different styles of music the terrific rooftop terrace includes a pool and hot tub. No matter if you make it to Montreal in time for Pride or not I do recommend visiting in the summer since the city prides itself on an abundance of outdoor activities during the warmer months. The streets are decked with outdoor seating and you can relax on Jean Dore Beach on the shores of St Lawrence River just minutes from downtown. Climb up to the top of Mount Royal for sweeping views over the city marvel at the murals on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and swing by lesbian-owned industrial warehouse-meets-beer garden Bar Alexandraplatz in the up-and-coming Mile-Ex neighborhood for a cold beer. When to go? No dates have been released yet but there will hopefully be another edition of the popular Slut Island Festival a feminist-queer DIY music festival that was founded in Montreal in 2013 mainly for performers and audiences who identify as women trans* gender-fluid nonbinary or people of color. The festival usually occurs in July. Montreal Pride 2019 happens August 8–18 2019. Before you go LezSpreadTheWord an organization that publishes the feminist LSTW magazine and created the popular queer web series Féminin/Féminin hosts the bimonthly girls party Où sont les femmes?” — try to plan your trip around one of their awesome parties. 3. Mallorca Spain Why go? Mallorca has been a popular holiday destination with Europeans for decades but in 2012 the Spanish island popped up on the lesbian travel map for the first time thanks to the inaugural Ella Festival in Palma Mallorca’s capital. In August the festival celebrates its seventh edition and no matter if you identify as lesbian bisexual queer transgender or intersex every woman is welcome at Ella! You’ll get to enjoy beach parties concerts and a number of activities from paddleboarding to beach volleyball as well as island excursions. While most of Mallorca’s LGBT nightlife happens in Palma I recommend exploring the rest of the island as well. The easiest way to get around is by car but you can also reach many beautiful beaches and little towns by bus. There are over 260 beaches in Mallorca but make sure to visit the picturesque small bays of Cala Formentor and Cala Pi and Cala Mesquida and Playa de Muro for wide sandy beaches. Also worth a visit the Cap de Formentor lighthouse on the northern tip of Mallorca and as many as you can of the charming little villages that dot the island for example Sóller Fornalutx Valledemossa and Deià. When to go? The Ella Festival is August 30–September 6 2019. Add on a week of island exploration before or after the festival. Before you go Check out Lesbian Mallorca the lesbian lifestyle directory” of the island has a great overview of lesbian bars and lesbian-friendly and lesbian-owned restaurants hotels and shops. 4. Provincetown Mass. USA Why go? Provincetown often referred to as P-Town is a small fishing town at the northern tip of Cape Cod and it has long been a favorite with LGBT travelers. The charming little seaside destination is a fantastic vacation spot for anyone — straight or gay — with over 200 independent shops plenty of art galleries delicious restaurants and great beaches but its focus on lesbian travelers and the celebration of freedom of expression are what makes this open-minded community so attractive for girls. Provincetown has more lesbian-owned businesses per capita than anywhere else in the US the highest concentration of same-sex households in the US and many LGBTQ-owned B&Bs and inns. No matter if you are solo or with your partner there’s something for everyone Provincetown is home to the oldest gay bar in the US the A-House the gayest main street in the world Commercial Street one of the top ten gay beaches in the world and the East End Gallery District offering world-class art. No matter what time of year you’re visiting you’re likely to stumble upon one of the town’s many themed weeks or weekends see below. The daily tea dance 4–7pm at the Boatslip an expansive deck that overlooks Provincetown’s West End Harbor is something you have to experience once — expect a packed dance floor and great people-watching. You’ll make new friends there for sure. When to go Try to plan your visit around one of the many women-focused events depending which one best fits your preferences and interests Women’s Media Summit April 5–7 Single Women’s Weekend May 17–19 Womxn of Color Weekend May 30– June 2 Pride May 31– June 3 Girl Splash July 23–27 Family Week the largest annual gathering of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer-identified families in the world July 27–August 3 the incredible Carnival which attracts 90000 visitors August 15–25 Women’s Week October 14–20 or the weeklong transgender celebration Fantasia Fair October 20–27. Before you go Since there are so many events year-round make sure to check what’s going on in P-Town during the dates of your visit. If they happen to be during Carnival for example be aware that the town turns into party central. Never arrive without having accommodation booked in advance — B&Bs and hotels tend to fill up quickly. 5. Puerto Rico Why go? Just over a year after devastating Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico with full force in September 2017 the island is bouncing back. Almost all hotels are open again the New York Times just awarded Puerto Rico the #1 spot on its popular 52 Places To Go in 2019 list and thanks to its status as a United States commonwealth the legal rights of LGBT citizens same-sex marriage has been legal since 2015 have had a great influence on Puerto Rico which is now the gay-friendliest of all Caribbean nations. Especially for Americans Puerto Rico is an easy getaway there are plenty of direct flights from East Coast airports and other US hubs you don’t need a passport and it’s a fantastic winter escape with temperatures around 81° Fahrenheit 27° Celsius in January. Both San Juan the capital and Ponce the island’s second largest city have several gay and LGBT-friendly bars and nightclubs and last year’s Pride Parade in San Juan attracted more than 5000 people. Most gay bars are in San Juan’s vibrant Santurce neighborhood. Circo Bar is the most popular and Oceano is a sophisticated gay-owned open-air beach bar across from Condado Beach. While there aren’t any lesbian bars per se the last one Cups closed a few years ago the go-to place for lesbians is El Cojo Bar in the Hato Rey district but all of Puerto Rico’s gay bars welcome women. Also worth a visit are the gay bars Tía María Liquor Store and Splash Lounge. While San Juan is the best base during your Puerto Rican gay-cation don’t miss out on the rest of the island. The jungles of El Yunque National Forest will wow those who are usually not into hiking the underground caves of Río Camuy Cave Park are spectacular and of course there are dozens of picture-perfect Caribbean beaches all over the island. A quick ferry ride brings you to Puerto Rico’s hidden gems the island of Vieques which is famous for Mosquito Bay one of the most bioluminescent bays in the world and Culebra Island where the turquoise waters at the stunning Playa Flamenco makes all your Caribbean beach dreams come true. Vieques a small dreamy island largely untouched by tourism is especially popular with lesbian travelers. Don’t expect any LGBT nightlife there but instead serene beaches unspoiled nature and even wild horses that roam freely in some parts. TripAdvisor listed Vieques as one of Top 25 Beach Destinations in the world because the island has more than 40 beaches and not one traffic light.” If you’re looking for a relaxing hideaway or a lesbian-friendly wedding spot—the W Resort offers same-sex ceremonies—Vieques is the place for you. When to go Puerto Rico is a wonderful beach destination during the winter months in the northern hemisphere. Mid-April to June before the summer rainy season starts is also a good time to visit — you’ll encounter less crowded beaches and fewer tourists. The gayest event of the year is Puerto Rico Pride but the date for the 2019 edition has yet to be announced it usually happens on Memorial Day Weekend. Before you go The upscale beachfront Ocean Park area of San Juan is where most LGBT travelers tend to stay. Not far from there is Condado a pedestrian area with a gay-friendly beach the stretch facing the gay Atlantic Beach Hotel. TripSavvy has a list of gay and gay-friendly hotels in San Juan. *** Of course these are not the only places that are worth a trip this year — there are hundreds of others worldwide. You don’t have to trek halfway around the globe to discover new amazing destinations. Why not plan a lesbian city break during Pride weekend in a city nearby? But out of all the places I’ve visited I’ve found these had some of my favorite welcoming and vibrant lesbian communities! They shouldn’t be missed. What are your favorites?

There are tons of free things to do in Boston enough to keep any visitor thoroughly entertained. It’s also a historic city whose success and survival was tied to the very existence of America itself. With such historical significance it should come as no surprise that I’ve always found the city fascinating I studied history in college after all. Boston’s roots stretch back to the 17th century when it was founded by Puritan colonists from Europe. It was a devout settlement with enforced church attendance and marriage persecution of sinners was equally enforced. The city was home to one of the first schools in America as well as the very first college Harvard. The settlement grew in importance with its most significant role being during the American Revolution. No single blog post can do Boston — and its complex and important history — justice.

But I was wrong. Dead wrong. Budapest turned out to be a vibrant city with a rich history beautiful parks and buildings bustling food halls cool underground bars and centuries-old thermal baths. There was indeed a lot to do. Since then I’ve been back many times and have even led tours there. I love how Budapest’s drab exterior hides an inner warmth. It’s hip. It’s cool. There is so much more to the city if you can look beyond its concrete façade. Do that and you’ll be rewarded with a visit to one of the best destinations on the continent. Budapest is actually two cities straddling the Danube Buda on the west side is hilly and classy while Pest pronounced pesht” on the east is its flatter wilder neighbor. A third Óbuda merged with the others in 1873. Each part has its own personality as if the river not only divides the city geographically but metaphysically too. To help you plan your visit to this marvelous Central European capital I’ve created this itinerary with the best things to see and do in Budapest taking you on — and off — the beaten path so you not only check out the main sights but you also get to know the locals and culture too. Budapest Itinerary Highlights Day 1 Castle Hill National Gallery Fisherman’s Bastion & more! Day 2 Parliament Great Market Hall Ruin Bars & more! Day 3 Gellért Hill Cave Church Terror Museum & more! Budapest Itinerary Day 1 Since Budapest is so neatly divided it’s best to tackle each half separately. Today we’re going to start with the Buda west side of the Danube. This is the upper-class ritzy area — complete with a castle — and it’s filled with lots of museums historic streets parks and regal homes. To kickstart your trip start your visit with a free walking tour! Take a Free Walking Tour I love free walking tours. If you’ve read some of my other posts you probably know that already since I’m always recommending them. They give you a wonderful way to get an overview of a place learn about its culture and orient yourself. Budapest has a number of good tours. Check these out and be sure to tip your guide! Strawberry Tours Trip to Budapest Generation Tours After the free walking tour which will last about three hours head over to Castle Hill. Tour Castle Hill This area has a lot of charm with cobblestone streets and narrow alleys running through the Old Town. There are panoramic views of Pest and the Danube great cafés and restaurants and shops to explore. The cheapest and easiest way to get up the hill is on the No. 16 bus. The funicular is another option but it usually has a lengthy wait. I actually prefer walking as I don’t think the hill is that steep. Once there explore some of the sights listed below Buda Castle They call it a castle but it’s more of a palace complex than anything else. Though it was originally constructed in the 13th century the huge Baroque complex you see today was built between 1749 and 1769. The palace’s days of being a luxurious living space ended in World War II though when Nazi and then Russian troops looted it. Today it’s home to a collection of museums see below. Beneath the castle Vlad the Impaler who we know colloquially as Count Dracula was imprisoned for 14 years. In the dungeon area there is a labyrinth that tourists used to be able to explore though it’s now closed which is too bad because it was really neat!. Szent György tér 2 +36 1 458 3000 budacastlebudapest.com. The courtyards are open 24/7 while the castle has hours that align with the museum and gallery below. Admission to the labyrinth is 3000 HUF for adults with discounts available for students and seniors. Budapest History Museum This museum covers four floors of Buda Castle and will really give you a comprehensive overview of the city’s entire history plus the views across town are amazing!. It has some rooms that date back to the 15th century and you can also explore the old cellar which also dates to the 15th century. Personally I really liked the 1000 Years of Budapest” area. +36 1 487 8800  budacastlebudapest.com/budapest-history-museum. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am-4pm 6pm in the summer. Admission varies by season 2000-2400 HUF with discounts for students and seniors and an additional charge for taking pictures free admission if you have the Budapest Card. An audio guide is available for 1200 HUF. Admission is free on national holidays. Hungarian National Gallery Opened in 1957 this museum focuses on Hungarian artists and history of which I knew very little before my visit. There are a lot of treasures here besides the paintings and sculptures you can see a collection of altarpieces from the 1400s and tour the building’s dome. To see what new temporary exhibits are on display check the website. 1014 Budapest +36 20 439 7325 mng.hu. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am-6pm last tickets sold at 5pm. Admission is 1800 HUF with discounts for students and seniors and an additional charge for taking pictures. Audio guides are available for 800 HUF. Hospital in the Rock This museum is underneath Castle Hill and just a five-minute walk from the castle. It has a fascinating history having served as a hospital bomb shelter prison and nuclear bunker. You’ll learn about World War II the 1956 revolution and the Cold War. It opened as a museum in 2008 and is one of the most popular attractions in town. There’s a one-hour guided tour complete with wax figures tools equipment and furnishings! Lovas ut 4/c  +36 70 701 0101 sziklakorhaz.eu/en. Open daily 10am-8pm. Admission is 4000 HUF for adults with discounts available for seniors and anyone under 19. Matthias Church This neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church is not what you might expect. I’ve seen hundreds of churches and cathedrals across Europe and this one is unique. The colorful roof almost looks like it was built from Legos. The original church was built in the 11th century though nothing remains of it. The current building was constructed in the 14th century though it saw significant renovations in the 19th century. Once inside you’ll notice the vaulted ceilings and ornate décor. It was a mosque for a while which explains its vibrant colors and painted designs that aren’t the norm in European churches. Szentháromság tér 2 +36 1 355 5657 matyas-templom.hu. Open 9am-5pm on weekdays 9am-1pm on Saturdays and 1pm-5pm on Sundays. Admission is 1800 HUF for adults with discounts for students and seniors. Guided tours are available for 2500 HUF. Fisherman’s Bastion This ornate fairytale structure faces Pest and provides great panoramic views across the Danube River. Built between 1895 and 1902 the terrace comprises seven lookout towers that represent the seven Hungarian tribes who founded Budapest. It was designed by the same architect who constructed the Matthias Church next door. The name comes from either the fact that the terrace overlooks the fishermen’s guild or that the fishermen’s guild actually was responsible for protecting that area of the wall — no one is quite certain. Szentháromság tér +36 1 458 3030 fishermansbastion.com. Open daily 9am-11pm. Admission is free with an additional charge of 1000 HUF 500 HUF for students/seniors to visit the upper turrets. Hungarian Presidential Palace The home of the Hungarian president is called Sándor-palota Alexander Palace. It is not super eye-catching compared to the surrounding buildings but if you time it right you can see the changing of the guard ceremony at the top of each hour from 9am to 5pm excluding Sundays. If you’re really lucky in the summer the palace will be open for tours though this rarely happens. Szent György tér 1-2 +36 1 224 5000. Admission to the changing of the guard is free. There is an additional fee for palace admission when available. Buda Tower This reconstructed tower” is all that remains of the Church of Mary Magdalene which was built in the 13th century but nearly destroyed during an air raid in World War II. When the Turks occupied the city between 1541-1699 it was used as a mosque. Since reopening in 2017 you can now climb the 172 steps to the top but given the great free views on Castle Hill I’d skip it and just view the tower from the outside. Kapisztrán tér 6 budatower.hu/en. Open daily 10am-6pm but only on the weekends in January and February. Admission is 1500 HUF for adults and 600 HUF for students. Budapest Itinerary Day 2 Today let’s tackle the Pest eastern side of town Visit Parliament This massive building on the Danube is where the Hungarian legislature meets. The literal translation means House of the Nation” or House of the Country.” After the three cities that make up modern Budapest Buda Pest and Óbuda united in 1873 it was decided that a new parliament building was needed. This massive structure took 19 years to build with construction finishing in 1904. Not only is it the tallest structure in Budapest but it’s actually the largest in the entire country. These days you can tour the Gothic Revival edifice and watch the changing of the guard. I recommend purchasing your tickets in advance as the lines to buy tickets on-site can be incredibly long. Kossuth Lajos tér 1-3 +36 1 441 4000 parlament.hu. Open daily 8am-6pm. Admission is 6000 HUF for non-EU adults 3100 HUF for non-EU students 2400 HUF for EU adults and 1300 HUF for EU students. Stroll Along the Danube A walk along the river is a nice activity after visiting Parliament. Head south and check out the promenade and its many green spaces and sculptures including the sobering Shoes on the Danube Bank” a memorial honoring the Jews who were shot here during World War II. Walk Across the Chain Bridge Continuing south you’ll reach the Széchenyi Chain Bridge connecting Pest with Buda. This wrought-iron and stone suspension bridge is 375m in length. It opened in 1849 though it had to be rebuilt after World War II. At the Pest east end of the Chain Bridge is the Gresham Palace a beautiful Art Nouveau building. It was once a luxurious office/apartment building and is now a luxurious hotel the Four Seasons. Eat at the Great Market Hall Built in 1897 this is the oldest and largest indoor market in the country a bit southwest of the Jewish Quarter. You’ll find mostly produce meats baked goods and candy on the ground floor while the upper floor is home to restaurants and souvenir shops. It has a lot of traditional places to eat so be sure to walk around and explore first. Sure it’s touristy it’s the central market after all! but I still found the food tasty. My favorites are the shops on the second floor on the right side closest to the front. Vámház körút 1–3. Open Monday 6am-5pm Tuesday-Friday 6am-6pm  and Saturday 6am-3pm. Closed on Sundays. Admission is free. Gaze at St. Stephen’s Basilica This is the largest church in Hungary and can’t be missed. It is beautiful inside and out with ornate architecture gorgeous artwork sparkling marble and a tall dome. No wonder it took 50 years to build! If you go inside check out all the little chapels and St. Stephen’s mummified hand. If you’re there on a Monday you can go to an organ concert. Szent István tér 1 +36 1 311 0839 bazilika.biz. Open weekdays 9am-5pm Saturday 9am-1pm and Sunday 1pm-5pm. Entry to the basilica is by donation though it’s 600 HUF per person for the tower/observation deck. Check out Dohány Street Synagogue Also known as the Great Synagogue this is the second-largest synagogue in the world built in 1854 and seating 3000 people. Make sure you go on the guided tour included with admission to get more perspective on the building. The guides are super knowledgeable and you’ll learn about the construction of the synagogue Jewish life during wartime and a lot more. Also check out Wallenberg Memorial Park right behind the synagogue and the nearby Hungarian Jewish Museum. Dohány u. 2 +36 1-343-0420. Hours vary from month to month call ahead for details. Admission is 4000 HUF for adults and 3000 HUF for students. See the Hungarian State Opera House You can go inside this neo-Renaissance masterpiece or just view it from outside. I recommend the latter as the auditorium is being renovated and the tour does not cover much of the building. If there are performances while you are in town try to catch one. It may even cost less than a tour! Andrássy u. 22 1061 +36 1-81-47-100 opera.hu. Tour admission is 2900 HUF for adults and 1900 HUF for students. Party at the Ruin Bars Ruin bars are all the rage in Budapest and have been around since the 2001 founding of Szimpla Kert the mecca of all ruin bars. They are in Budapest’s District VII neighborhood the old Jewish Quarter in the ruins of abandoned buildings stores or lots. This neighborhood was left to decay after World War II so it was a perfect place to develop an underground bar scene. Not so underground anymore though! From the outside these bars look like normal homes. They don’t have large signs pointing the way you don’t hear any loud noise and there’s no line of people waiting to get in. Here are my favorites Szimpla Kert – This is the original and most famous ruin bar and started this trend. Once an abandoned factory it has a large open courtyard a top floor with eclectic furniture cocktail bars and even an old stripped-down Trabant Communist-era car you can have a drink in. Kazinczy u. 14 +36 20 261 8669 szimpla.hu. Open 12pm-4am on weekdays 9am-4am on Saturdays and 9am-5am on Sundays.

Budapest Itinerary Day 3 Explore Gellért Hill Start your day back in Buda with a trip to Gellért Hill south of Castle Hill. This hill offers the best views of Budapest and it’s a popular spot to watch a sunset from. If you go for the sunset take a flashlight for the trip home! There are several monuments on the hill that you’ll want to stop and appreciate Liberty Statue – This bronze statue was erected in 1947 to celebrate the liberating Soviet forces who defeated the Nazis. It’s 14m tall and sits on a 26m pedestal. When Hungary adopted democracy in 1989 the transcription and meaning of the statue was changed to reflect this. Statue of Queen Elisabeth – This statue is dedicated to the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary Elisabeth who married Franz Joseph I Emperor of Austria. Statue of King Saint Stephen – This statue is dedicated to Hungary’s first king who reigned from 1000 to 1038 CE. He helped establish the country as a Christian nation and provided a period of relative peace and stability. Szent Gellért Monument – This monument is dedicated to Saint Gerard who was the first Bishop of Csanád in what was the Kingdom of Hungary in 1030 CE. He kicked off the conversion of Hungary to Christianity and a monument was constructed in his honor in 1904. See the Cave Church Aside from these picturesque statues and the epic view Gellért Hill is home to the most unusual church in the city. In the 1920s monks built this church in a cave that had been previously used by a hermit monk. It was used as a hospital during World War II and the Communist government covered the entrance in concrete after the war and executed the head monk. There’s a lot more to the history of this church than I have room to cover here so make sure to use the audio guide. Sziklatemlom út Gellért Hill sziklatemplom.hu/web/fooldal.html. Open Monday-Saturday 930am-730pm. Admission is 600 HUF. Visit the Museum of Terror In this frightening museum you’ll learn what life was like for Hungarians under the fascist and Communist regimes of the 1900s. The building was used by the ÁVH Secret Police and Arrow Cross Party the Hungarian Nazi party. The permanent exhibits are spread over four floors and house all sorts of old propaganda weapons and informative multimedia displays. Over 700000 Hungarians were killed or imprisoned by the Soviets and the museum does a good job at illustrating just how dreadful their daily lives were. For information on the temporary exhibits check the website for the most up-to-date information. Andrássy út 60 +36 1 374 26 00 terrorhaza.hu/en. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am-6pm. Admission is 3000 HUF for adults and 1500 HUF for students and seniors. Tour Heroes’ Square At the end of Andrássy Avenue is the largest square in Hungary. Its centerpiece is the Millennial Memorial and the statues of Hungarian kings and other historical figures including the seven chiefs who led the Magyars modern-day Hungarians in the 9th century CE. The monument was built in 1896 to celebrate Hungary’s 1000th anniversary. At this time Hungary was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled by the Hapsburgs and space was left for statues of future Hapsburg leaders. The square is at the entrance to City Park where you can visit the zoo and the Széchenyi Baths see below if there’s time. The Museum of Fine Arts and the Palace of Art are located nearby as well making for interesting stops if you’re interested in art. Soak at the Baths Hungarians love their thermal spa baths. Budapest has more than 100 mineral hot springs that have been put to good use since Roman times. With 18 pools the Széchenyi Baths in City Park are the largest and most famous in Europe. The stunning yellow buildings were built in 1913 and it’s a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. If you’re only going to one thermal spa this is the one!

There are six therapy pools here as well as a swimming pool with the water said to cure all sorts of illnesses. Admission varies greatly by day time and pool starting at 1700 HUF for a weekday evening visit to the swimming pool. When visiting the baths don’t forget your bathing suit and flip-flops. You can typically rent towels and lockers. Other Things to See and Do in Budapest If you have more than three days in Budapest you’re in luck. There are plenty of other activities to fill your time. Visit an Island For a unique experience visit an island on the Danube. Here are the ones I like best Margaret Island – This popular island is smack in the middle of the Danube connected by the Margaret and Árpád Bridges. Visitors mainly tour the park visit the swimming pools and watch the Musical Fountain which sprays water high into the air in sync with the music. There are also some dance clubs which are especially busy on the weekends. Óbuda Island – This island is known for its outdoor activities including wakeboarding jet skiing and golf on the driving range. It comes alive in August when thousands of people visit for the Sziget Festival of music and culture and a casino will soon open. Visit the House of Houdini Harry Houdini was one of the most famous and well-known illusionists in the world. He was known of his elaborate escape tricks and he was actually born in Hungary. This is the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Budapest native. It’s home to quite a few Houdini props and pieces of memorabilia as well as live magic shows. 11 Dísz Square +36 1-951-8066 houseofhoudinibudapest.com.

Stick me in a Thai market surrounded by food stalls and I’m a happy man! Bangkok is the hub for travel in Southeast Asia and chances are you’re likely to pass through it on your travels around the region. The city has thousands of guesthouses and hostels. There are so many that it can take hours to narrow down your choices when looking online. Luckily I’ve been visiting Bangkok for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Bangkok are Location – Bangkok is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Bangkok you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi though virtually none include free breakfast. If you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Whether it’s relaxing on a picturesque beach exploring Mayan ruins or snorkeling the world’s second longest barrier reef you’ll discover that Belize is full of amazing and adventurous things to do. The country is one of the most unique destinations in Central America and among my favorite countries in the region. It’s also where I did my first solo backpacking trip and since that first trip I’ve loved every minute I’ve spent there. From the Latin culture of the interior to the Caribbean Rasta vibe of the coast to the old English feel of some of the islands Belize is a mash-up of vibrant and historic cultures. The country is popular with backpackers vacationers dive enthusiasts and honeymooners alike offering something for every travel style and interest. And tourism is on the rise too. In 2018 Belize saw an all-time high of 1.5 million visitors — which is a lot for a country of just over 40000 people! Tourism will no doubt continue to increase here as Belize is one of the safest countries in the area to visit. But just because it’s safe doesn’t mean you can let your guard down fully. Here are some tips to help you stay safe during your visit 9 Safety Tips for Belize 1. Avoid isolated areas – If you’re somewhere isolated you’ll be at a greater risk for getting robbed especially at night and in the cities. Try to stay where the crowds are — that’s the best way to avoid being singled out by potential muggers. 2. Be aware of your surroundings while in crowds – While sticking to where the crowds will help you avoid getting mugged it will also make you a target for petty theft. Tourists are usually easy targets for pickpockets so when you are in the popular tourist areas make sure your valuables are secure. 3. Don’t wear flashy items – Petty theft is the most common threat here so remove any jewelry or watches and don’t wave your phone around. Do your best to blend in so you don’t become a target for pickpockets. If you happen to find yourself a victim of armed robbery follow the instructions of the robber and give up your valuables these material items can be replaced — but your life cannot. I learned this lesson the hard way in Colombia. 4. Don’t leave your items unattended – If you are spending the day on the beaches of Placencia Peninsula Hopkins Village or Caye Caulker do not leave your belongings unattended while swimming or walking along the sand as locals and tourists alike can easily swipe your valuables. If you can find friends at your hostel to hit the beach with so you can take turns watching over each other’s things while you swim and relax. 5. Avoid the bus at night – If you need to get somewhere at night take a taxi. It will be safer than any public transportation. Have your accommodation call the taxi for you so you can be sure you’re getting a reputable driver. Make sure you get in a taxi with a green license plate as those indicate authorized taxis. If you’re a solo female traveler make sure you travel with other people at night even in taxis. 6. Be careful on public transit – If you must take public transit keep your valuables on you and well secured especially on chicken buses” colorfully decorated school buses that have been converted to public transportation for goods and people. Theft is common on night buses so avoid them if you can. Buses also tend to not run on time and sometimes they are extremely slow packed or both. Be prepared for the experience! 7. Don’t do drugs – Cartels in Belize have made life very difficult for the local population. Don’t support them by buying their products. Drug penalties are also harsh in the region and you don’t want to end up in jail! 8. Stick to the touristy parts of Belize City – Belize City the largest city has some sketchy neighborhoods that unfortunately have been taken over by local gangs. There are areas however that are relatively safe such as the main tourist part of town. If you don’t wander too far from there you should be fine. 9. Buy travel insurance – Travel insurance will protect you if you get injured or ill are a victim of theft or must deal with delayed or canceled flights. It’s a worthwhile investment and can save you thousands of dollars. Don’t risk traveling without it. I always buy travel insurance before I leave home — a lesson I’ve learned the hard way! FAQ on Safety in Belize Below are answers to common questions I get on safety in Belize so you can be better prepared for your trip! Is there a risk of Zika in Belize? Belize has a history of Zika virus transmission but there is currently no evidence of an ongoing outbreak. While the risks are low travelers are advised to take the following precautions Use mosquito repellent on your body on top of any sunscreen to prevent bites and sleep under a mosquito net to avoid getting bit while when you’re asleep. Wear breathable garments that cover your arms and legs. Keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to prevent mosquitos from entering your room. Pregnant women or couples considering pregnancy should consult a healthcare practitioner prior to travel. Is hitchhiking safe there? Hitchhiking in Belize is quite common easy and — most importantly — safe. My friends and I hitchhiked throughout the country and saw lots of locals doing it too. HitchWiki has a lot of information on hitchhiking in Belize to help you get started. Is the street food safe? It sure is safe to have street food in Belize! The best and most affordable way to experience the local cuisine is through their street food which has Afro-Caribbean and Mexican cultural influences. Sample conch fritters ceviche or coconut curry and enjoy the variety of delicious flavors! Is the tap water safe to drink? Belize’s Ministry of Health has taken steps toward making tap water drinkable for locals. However during the rainy season some areas experience flooding which may contaminate the tap water. The best way to make sure your drinking water is safe is to bring a SteriPen or Lifestraw for your reusable water bottle. This way you’ll be able to purify the tap water so you don’t get sick — and avoid single-use plastic bottles in the process. Are the taxis safe? Taxis are safe — and preferred — when getting around at night. You can ask your hostel or hotel to call a taxi for you. Be sure to get take an authorized taxi they have green license plates. Use your smartphone and track the route on your offline map and if the driver seems to be going off said route speak up and ask why they’ve decided to take this direction instead. At the end of the day always trust your gut if a taxi driver seems shady stop the cab and get out. If you’re a solo female traveler I suggest traveling with a friend or another traveler at night just to be safe. Is Belize safe for solo travelers? Solo traveling in Belize is safe although petty theft is one of the most common types of crime in Belize. The people involved in some sort of incident tend to be drinking or doing drugs or taking part in illegal activity. If you don’t do it at home don’t do it in Belize! Follow that rule and you’ll be fine. Is Belize safe for solo female travelers? Belize is a safe place for solo female travelers especially if you’re new to solo travel. It is one of the safer countries in this region. However that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be careful. Always be aware of your surroundings and have a downloaded map so you can find your way home. Don’t flaunt any valuables and avoid taking taxis alone at night. If you’ve done your research and still have concerns I’d suggest asking to join other groups at hostels when going out or sticking to group travel or tours just to be safe. Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel Women Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Travel Alone *** I loved my time in Belize. The country may be small but it had so much to offer from dense jungles to massive caves and of course the famous Belize Barrier Reef where the marine life is astonishing. And in my opinion the Blue Hole is one of the best places to go scuba diving. The toughest challenge for you will be deciding what to do first! While Belize is considered generally safe for traveling and backpacking there’s no denying that some precautions should be taken. Read and follow this safety guide and your experience in Belize will be a safe fun and memorable one. Book Your Trip to Belize Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. I use them all the time. My favorite hostels in Chile are The Red Hut Inn Belize City – This is a chill social hostel with lots of areas to relax in — includng a pool. The staff are great too! Dirty McNasty Caye Caulker – This is one of the biggest hostels in the country and known for its wild parties. Anda Di Hows Hostel Placencia – A cozy hostel on the beach with great staff and free kayaks and snorkeling gear you can use for free. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. I’ve been using World Nomads for ten years.

There are 5 Comments Mo October 21 2019 at 458 pm I didn’t have the best luck in Belize despite trying to be extra careful and plan for everything typical that could happen. Halfway through our trip we went to the well-reviewed Belize zoo and I was attacked/repeatedly bitten by one of their monkeys that had escaped! It was especially ironic as I read on every board like here to not go to the non-touristy parts of Belize City due to safety. Guess where I was rushed to treat wounds? The bad part of town to the ER. I’m not sure if I would or would not recommend Belize bad things could happen anywhere although perhaps some countries have better protocols/laws to protect against the type of negligence on the zoo’s part? Anyway I am now a huge believer in travel insurance after this incident. From my experience World Nomads is very easy to file claims through.

Environmentally friendly travel is now one of the fastest-growing movements in the industry and I for one welcome this trend. It’s an incredibly important topic that I’ve been writing about for years. After all why destroy what you love? No one wants to see paradise paved over. We all cringe when we return to an overdeveloped polluted destination. None of us want to contribute to that. Being an eco-friendly traveler is simply being a respectful traveler. As we strive to become more environmentally conscious the questions for travelers become Just how do we green” our travels? What can we do to lower our carbon footprint as we travel the world? How can we better interact with the communities we visit? What changes can we make that are actually helpful? Flight shaming people is not the answer but do we all just stay home and quit traveling? Fortunately there’s actually a lot we can do as travelers to reduce our ecological footprint while contributing to the sustainability of the communities we visit. Here are 13 concrete ways to reduce your environmental impact as a traveler 1. Stay Close to Home Though the exotic is always appealing travel doesn’t have to be about going somewhere far away. Travel is the art of exploration and discovery — and that can just as well be nearby. Find somewhere close to home you haven’t been get in your car or better yet take the bus and go visit. You never know what you’ll come across! X” is always the most interesting place on the map. 2. Make Greener Transportation Choices If you can try to travel by train or bus. Not only does this reduce your carbon footprint but companies like FlixBus Megabus and Greyhound always have some cheap tickets so you can save money too. And when traveling by car consider offering rides to other travelers to lower your collective emissions and cut costs. Many people will be happy to chip in for gas if it saves them time which means you can save money and lower your carbon footprint at the same time. Win-win! That will cut your per-person transportation emissions in half if not more. Use platforms like BlaBlaCar Couchsurfing and Craigslist to find rideshares near you. Avoid flying or driving long distances by yourself whenever you can. 3. Travel Slow When we travel abroad we have a tendency to rush around from place to place trying to soak in as many sights as possible. I get that. After all not everyone can be permanent nomads and when you have limited time and aren’t sure if you’re coming back again I can see why people travel fast.” However not only does this raise your transportation costs since you’re moving a lot you end up increasing your carbon footprint. All those trains buses and planes add up. The fewer you take the better. Additionally being a good traveler not only means reducing your carbon footprint but also doing good by the communities you visit. Day-tripping brings in very little money to communities but impacts their infrastructure heavily it’s why the city of Hallstatt in Austria is restricting day tours. So try to stay at a destination for a least a night. Traveling to fewer destinations is good not only for your wallet and the climate it’s good for local communities as well. Plus slowing your travels will let you get to know places in a deeper way since you’ll get to spend more time there. In travel less can be more. 4. Pack Smart While the specifics of will depend on where you’re going there are a few things you’ll want to bring with you to help you travel more sustainably Reusable water bottle – Nalgene makes durable bottles that are BPA-free and made in the USA. Water filter – Many destinations don’t have potable water which means you’re going to be using tons of single-use plastic. Instead bring a Lifestraw or SteriPen. These devices will purify your water so you can drink from practically anywhere ensuring you can avoid single-use plastic bottles. Tote bag/stuff sack – If you’re traveling long-term bring a tote back or an extra stuff sack. You can use them for buying groceries and avoid plastic bags. At other times they can be used to keep your bag organized. Diva cup – This is a reusable menstrual cup. While I can’t speak from personal experience it’s something our resident solo female travel expert packs when she travels since menstrual products are not always available and can also be quite wasteful. Utensils – Travel cutlery a fork knife and spoon or just a spork or a set of chopsticks can come in handy if you’re on a budget and plan on cooking your own meals. But they’re also useful for street food and eating out as you can avoid plastic cutlery. Additionally bring a small Tupperware container for leftovers. I always find myself with extra food when I cook in hostels. This helps avoid waste and provides food for the next day. It’s an amazing travel hack surprisingly few people make use of. 5. Fly with Fewer Connections While I don’t believe in flight shaming it’s impossible to deny that flying does have a hefty carbon impact. In addition to limiting your flying try to use longer flights with fewer connections. Twenty-five percent of airplane emissions occur during takeoff and landing which means if you fly shorter flights with more connections your emissions will be drastically higher. Flying direct is simply the better option environmentally so opt for that whenever possible. 6. Avoid Overvisited Destinations If you can avoid cities grappling with overtourism. You’ll find fewer crowds and lower prices and you also won’t be putting as much strain on local communities struggling to keep up. And from a sheer personal-enjoyment point of view who wants to deal with crowds or long lines? No one. If you do visit overtouristed places such as Venice Amsterdam or Barcelona pick a hotel or hostel instead of using sites like Airbnb. Apartment rentals drive up rents for locals and force them out of the city center. Unless you’re going to share accommodation with a local by renting a room from them or using Couchsurfing stick to hotels and hostels. Airbnb and similar sites really are detrimental to cities that don’t have a lot of housing. 7. Take Public Transportation After walking public transportation is the next best way to explore new destinations. On arrival head to the local tourism office to learn about the options as well as any visitor discounts available for public transit. If you do need a taxi use ridesharing apps instead. Uber and Lyft have a pool” option in many cities which lets you split your ride with other travelers. While it may take a little longer to get to your destination it will save you money and ensure that your ride is as eco-friendly as possible. When it comes to longer distances budget buses are your best way of getting around since they usually pack in a lot of passengers. Megabus and FlixBus are two of the most popular options. 8. Eat Local Food that is imported has a much higher carbon footprint than locally grown food and it’s usually not as fresh either. To keep your carbon footprint down eat like a local. Stick to foods that are grown locally and avoid packaged and imported foods much as possible. This will ensure that you’re eating seasonal produce which not only is going to be the freshest but will also support the local economy. Also stick to organic food if you can. Sure the odd Western comfort meal is not the end of the world but the more you eat locally the more you reduce your environmental footprint and the more you help the local economy as well. After all you didn’t come to Thailand to eat a burger you could get at home right? 9. Cut Back on Meat and Dairy I’m not saying you need to go vegan. I love meat and never plan to give up bacon. But if you’re concerned with the impact of your food reducing your meat and dairy intake is extremely helpful. Over 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food — and the majority of those emissions are from animal products. So by cutting back on your meat and dairy consumption you’ll drastically reduce your carbon footprint. Avoid Brazilian beef if you can as lot comes from cleared rainforest land. Cattle ranching is the #1 cause of rainforest deforestation in the world. Same for soy too. Plus it’s never been easier to travel as a vegan or vegetarian as there are tons of amazing restaurants out there — as well as apps to help you find them you can download the HappyCow app to find the best vegan and vegetarian options near you. Even if you take meat and dairy out of one meal a week you’ll be moving the needle in favor of a lower carbon footprint and a more ethical diet. 10. Avoid Animal Attractions Part of traveling green is helping the other creatures that inhabit his earth. That means you should avoid any and all attractions that use captive wild animals for entertainment. The most common offenders are riding elephants swimming with dolphins visiting captive whales and petting drugged tigers. These activities require animal abuse and imprisonment and should be avoided. Animals are best viewed in their natural habitats. If you want to see them go on a safari jungle hike or whale-watching tour and see the animals where they belong in the wild. If you want to be an ethical and responsible traveler stick to taking photographs and avoid direct interactions with animals. For more information on animal tourism and how to avoid it check out these helpful organizations World Animal Protection Wildlife Watch 11. Reduce Your Plastic Use I hate plastic. It creates a ton of waste. From plastic bottles to toothpaste tubes to shopping bags plastic sucks. I admit I’m not perfect and I still use too much but I’m always trying to reduce my consumption both at home and abroad. Avoiding plastic as much as possible is a great way to reduce your environmental impact. You can buy a reusable water bottle use toothpaste tabs carry your own cutlery and travel with a canvas bag for starters. Additionally skip the plastic straws and cutlery and avoid getting take-out unless it comes in biodegradable containers. Straws can take 200 years to biodegrade and plastic bags take 20. Don’t let a few minutes of convenience endanger the planet. Skip the plastic. 12. Cut Back on Cruises Cruises are one of the worst offenders when it comes to carbon footprints and overtourism. Taking a cruise has the same average per-person carbon footprint as flying from London to Tokyo — round-trip. That’s almost 20000 kilometers 12500 miles! Thanks to cruises carbon emissions in popular port cities can be so high that thousands of people actually die prematurely every year. And to top it all off day-trippers from cruises visits are overwhelming local economies driving up prices forcing out locals and creating destinations that are over-reliant on tourism. Don’t get me wrong cruises are a fun way to travel. But if you’re looking to lower your environmental footprint you’ll want to avoid cruises as much as possible. 13. Take a Nature-Related Trip Travel is one of the best personal development tools there is. It opens you up to a whole new world and widens your perspective of so many things — people culture history food and so much more. If you want to better understand and appreciate the natural world try taking a trip with the sole purpose of connecting with nature. Head to the Australian Outback go diving and swim around coral reefs visit national parks camp in the Moroccan desert stay a few weeks in a town with little or no electricity canoe down the Amazon River or spend a few nights under the stars in a field close to home. Do something that gets you in touch with the world in a way that sitting at home with all the electricity and free-flowing running water doesn’t. I promise that when you come home you’ll have a new perspective on why we’re all so focused on being environmentally friendly these days. It doesn’t take much to see that we are living unsustainably and something’s got to give. Going on a nature adventure can get you to think differently when it comes to the environment and how important it is for us to treat it well. *** Traveling in a more green and eco-friendly way is something we should all aspire to. As travelers it’s our responsibility to make sure that while we explore the globe we do so in a way that doesn’t harm the planet or the local communities that we visit. With a few simple changes you can all become better and more sustainable travelers. You just need to take that first step. Action begets action and the more actions you take the easier the other ones will be. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

Reply M February 20 2020 at 207 pm I really appreciate the intent of this post but this is a bit incongruous. It’s advice in a post written by someone who isn’t living in Asia who is writing from Asia even though the first point of advice is to stay close to home and then the next is to avoid flying by using ground transport and then after that to avoid ground transport because it’s wasteful and you should go slower. Moreover to make an indictment about cruises being equivalent to a round trip from Tokyo to London while announcing a personal itinerary that includes a ‘cheap flight to’ Taiwan two destinations in Europe and then a trip back home does not come across as… Integrous. I agree with these principles but there needs to be some… Consistency checking and maybe some more research to back up such guidances? For instance why is ride sharing necessarily better for a local economy over a taxi? Eating locally grown foods can be argued to be more wasteful than concentrating food production in areas with more productive food growing environments etc. don’t jump me for this I know it’s very nuanced and controversial!. Just.. Sharing this b/c the topic is important but the content could be improved to be more helpful to the cause I think. =/ Reply Paul Andrade February 21 2020 at 623 pm I will never take Greyhound again unless I have no other choice.

Doing some research I found that their lawyers had a hand in creating the regulations othey’re subject to and there are many thousands of similar complaints of similar stories about Greyhound posted on .the internet. I believe my bag was not lost but stolen by employees. Beware Reply Adam LaPlante February 24 2020 at 447 pm It’s hard to wrap heads around the idea that travel isn’t exactly sustainable. But as someone who also travels quite often I have actual begun to see more and more change in terms of sustainability and travel. You start to notice more reusable water bottles in peoples’ packs and more places for the users to fill up! I was super excited to see a bottle fill station for my first time in an airport a few years back. And better yet the US national parks I can not speak for other countries have been on top of the game for sustainable travel. For as long as I could remember they have have had water fill stations free public transportation throughout the park and even gone as far as replacing bathroom amenities with zero-water ones! I like the ideas you’ve brought forward and will totally be incorporating some of them myself as I continue to make travel my lifestyle! Reply Rebecca February 26 2020 at 525 am Traveling light not demanding everything which you are used to in your home country and using eco-friendly transportation is always my top priorities. Few of my fellow first-time travelers keeps comparing the new country with their own which is somewhat natural. But my advise is not to find what you’ve already seen instead explore and differences with an open mind. Sad to say but going vegan is not my thing 🙂 Reply Cynthia Morris February 29 2020 at 339 pm Great article. Lots to think about and act upon. Re #7 I love accessing local bike share systems. It’s a great inexpensive way to get around. You see much more from a bike and learn how the local traffic patterns flow. Also of course it’s great to get exercise while getting around. Makes it easier to eat more local food! Reply Hamim March 14 2020 at 1008 am Good article Matt! I think all of us can participate and prosper sustainable travel. I am working on sustainable travel concepts in the Middle East. There are many places to visit in Middle East but the sustainable concept still missing there. I hope everyone understand the situation. Reply Leave a Comment Cancel reply By posting a comment you agree to our community friendly anti-spam comment policy that can be found here.

I spent years teaching in Thailand and Taiwan and they were some of the most impactful experiences of my traveling. Living in a foreign culture trying to get by day to day and learning to create a life for yourself is a surefire way to become a more confident you and give you a deeper understanding of yourself. I get a lot of emails from people about teaching overseas and one of the most asked about destinations is Spain! While we’ve written about the destination before I wanted to add in another perspective from someone who just did it last year. Natasha is a local Austinite who graduated from school and moved to Spain for a year. Here she is explaining how she did it and how you can too! Tell us about yourself! Natasha I was born in Atlanta Georgia but my family moved to India when I was two months old. After a year we moved to Australia where I grew up until I was 9. Then we moved to Vancouver where I stayed until I was 15. I consider myself to be from Australia Canada and the US in almost equal parts and ethnically I am Indian and Pakistani. I double-majored in international relations and Latin American studies at UT-Austin. In my free time I make YouTube videos about travel and I am devoted to health and fitness. I also cook and practice yoga. You recently spent some time teaching in Spain. Tell us how you got started doing that. Was it easy to figure out the process and find a job? I studied abroad in Madrid in college. While I was there I met some people who were English-language assistants and kept in touch with them after I returned home. I knew I wanted to take a gap year and travel after graduation so I reached out to them and they told me about different programs I could apply for. I looked into a few but the government program Auxiliares de Conversación” was free and had good reviews so I chose to apply to that one. It allows Americans and Canadians to visit and work as teaching assistants. You’ll be paired with a teacher and help the students learn English. There are similar programs for people from other English-speaking countries as well. The application is quite daunting. It required an essay two letters of recommendation a lot of legal paperwork and other forms. The essay I wrote was about a page long essentially a letter of intent explaining why I was interested in the program and the qualities that make me fit for the position. The program also requires an official college transcript as well but it accepts applicants from diverse educational backgrounds. so as long as you show keen interest have good letters of recommendation and have decent grades you should be fine! I didn’t decide to join this program until the beginning of March but I would suggest starting the process as soon as it is available in January. That will give you more time to jump through all the bureaucratic hoops. After receiving your acceptance I suggest booking your visa appointment immediately as these fill up fast! Did you have any prior teaching experience? Is experience necessary? I didn’t have any teaching experience and the Auxiliar de Conversación program doesn’t require you to. As long as you have or are completing your bachelor’s degree and are a native English speaker you are eligible. What was an average day like? You are only required to work 12-16 hours a week with this program so a workday is typically about four hours. Since we’re English-language assistants we are paired with an English teacher and don’t have to create a curriculum for the whole class. On an average day as an auxiliar the teacher I worked with would mostly have me walk around and assist students with the activities she had assigned them to do. Since I was an assistant and not the main teacher my job mostly consisted of providing help like that. The teacher for the younger grades would have me work one-on-one with students that were falling behind or had special needs to give them more attention but we usually worked on the same activities as the other students. For about 10-15 minutes of the class I would sometimes give a presentation or play vocabulary games such as Bingo or Hangman. I was never required to teach an entire lesson but I would occasionally have to manage small groups of students. This allowed them to participate more since they would not be as shy to speak English and it’s easier to control a few students than a whole class. Regarding the actual teaching it was the easiest and smoothest part of my time in Spain. As long as you can keep the students interested and engaged you won’t have any issues. Did you have any unexpected challenges? Many! I lived about an hour’s walk from my school which was inconvenient and isolating. It took me a while to figure out the bus system so adapting to my location was the first challenge. However the biggest challenge I faced was having to come back to the US for a month because I didn’t have a visa. I was informed that I didn’t need a visa prior to entering Spain but upon arrival I would need to get my NIE Número de Identidad de Extranjero and I would be set. Well when I arrived I was the only applicant without a visa. I went to eight different foreign consulates and no one knew if I had to leave Spain to get a visa. Ultimately I had to fly back to the US score an almost-impossible-to-get appointment with the Spanish consulate and get my visa. The bureaucratic system is slow and very tedious so try to talk to former auxiliares if you can there are lots of Facebook groups for this. What is one thing you wish you knew before you started teaching? I wish I knew that one person’s experience could be very different from the next. I had an amazing overall experience however parts of my life didn’t go as I expected. I went in expecting to make great connections with my colleagues more than anyone else but the environment at the school I worked at wasn’t very welcoming. A lot of teachers at my school didn’t live in the community they commuted from pueblos as far as an hour away. This made it hard to form close friendships. Moreover my school was comprised of teachers who were still completing their exams so every year the teachers changed schools. That meant that the sense of community was not very strong. Fortunately I became friends with other auxiliares in my area and was welcomed warmly into their community. I became friends with teachers at other schools took trips with them and received lots of help with life in general in Spain. What kind of salary can auxiliares expect? Auxiliares earn a scholarship” rather than a salary. I was paid 1000 EUR/month $1100 USD during my contract. I would say that one should expect around 700-1000 EUR per month $770-1100 USD or about 15 EUR/hour $16.50 USD. Auxiliares in Madrid received the same scholarship” as I did but the cost of living in that region is much higher. If you are paid 700 EUR you usually work 12 hours a week instead of 16 and you can definitely try and teach private English lessons to earn more. What are your top three tips for someone interested in teaching in Spain? 1. Arrive with at enough to live off of for at least three months. I was fortunate to live in a city with decent prices for accommodation. I had two roommates and spent around 250 EUR/month $275 USD on rent. Groceries rent and transportation were my main expenses around 650 EUR $715 USD for all of those plus some miscellaneous things. This left me with just a bit of money to use for travel. In the Valencia region the government was three months late to start paying us and always late by at least a few days to a week after the first paycheck. Since it’s not a lot of money you’ll want to have a lot of savings. That way if you’re paid late you will have enough money to get by. 2. Research where you want to work. I chose Madrid as my first choice and Andalucía as my second. I would have also liked to live in Barcelona but that wasn’t an option. I applied late to the program and existing auxiliares have priority for where they are stationed. As a new applicant and a late one I was sent to Valencia. When choosing regions be aware that a region does not necessarily mean you will end up in the city it’s named for. By that I mean the Madrid” region does not only mean the city of Madrid but rather the entire region around the city. Regions are like states and so you could end up living two hours or more from the capital of the region. You should also take into account the language spoken in the region. Where I lived people spoke Valenciano just as much if not more than Spanish and school was conducted in valenciano a dialect of Catalan. Luckily Valenciano has similarities to Spanish. However if you’re placed in the Basque Country northern Spain they speak Euskara which has no similarities to Spanish. So if your goal is to practice or learn Spanish make sure you choose to live in a region that speaks it. Weather is another aspect to consider. While in the summer it is warm almost everywhere winters can be quite cold more so in the north. If you’re not a fan of cold weather consider living closer to the south and the sea. There are auxiliar Facebook groups and blogs that have plenty of information and anecdotes about different regions which can help you make your decision. 3. Learn some Spanish. Understand that you could be placed in a pueblo very far from a big city so brush up on your Spanish a little. It isn’t mandatory to teach English but it will really come in handy if you’re in a smaller location and want to connect more with the locals and your colleagues.

While I love solo travel as much as the next person — and think Europe is one of the best places to backpack around — the continent is also a huge destination for tour groups. When you think of group tours you may imagine a horde of camera-clicking tourists wearing socks and sandals swarming off a massive bus taking lots of pictures and then moving on to the next site. In the past that image was pretty accurate. But now? Not so much. These days the best tours have evolved and are much more nuanced and diverse catering to all different age groups and travel styles. From hop-on hop-off tours and river cruises to big bus and backpacker tours and everything in between there’s a wide variety of tour options now. No matter what kind of experience you’re looking for or your budget you’ll be able to find awesome and insightful tours to help you make the most out of your next trip to Europe. I’ve taken tours offered by dozens of companies on the continent. Some were good some bad some great. If you’re thinking of taking a tour around Europe — whether because it saves you time or money — here is a list of the best companies THE BEST DY TOURS IN EUROPE New Europe Pretty much every major city in Europe has a free walking tour. They are a fun insightful way to orient yourself and learn about the history of a city. Plus you’ll have access to a local expert who can answer any and all questions you have about the destination! New Europe is one of the largest and best tour companies out there. Its guides are knowledgeable and its tours cover all the major tourist sites. They also offer specialized tours like food tours day trips and tours to specific historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle or the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. You can find them pretty much everywhere in Europe. Just remember to tip your guides at the end! Most tours will last around 3 hours. For their paid tours prices start around 15 EUR per person and go up from there depending on the duration of the tour. –> Click here to learn more about New Europe! Free Tours By Foot Another free option is Free Tours By Foot. Like New Europe they have qualified guides and a wide variety of themed tours in over 30 destinations across the continent. Chances are you’ll be able to find a tour with them or with a company affiliated with them in every major city around the continent. Tours usually last around 3 hours so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Since they offer free tours make sure you tip your guide at the end. They also have partnerships with other tour companies so you can find more specialized options here as well. For example they have a great beer tour of Paris as well as a macaroon tour if that’s more your style. Those tours aren’t free they cost around 60 EUR per person but they are a great way to get a specialized insight as well as to try some amazing French beer and desserts!. –> Click here to learn more about Free Tours By Foot! Walks If you’re looking for something a little more in-depth my favorite walking tour company in Europe is Walks which can be found in London Athens and various cities in Spain and Italy. What makes these food art and history tours so special is that they get access to places others don’t like the Louvre after hours secret spots in the Vatican or Versailles etc. The guides are incredibly well informed so you’ll learn a ton of information. If you’re looking for a paid walking tour company Walks is the best. Their tours are usually around 3 hours though they also have a few full-day options as well. Expect to pay at least 60-90 EUR per person. Be sure to book in advance as well as many of their best tours like their Sistine Chapel early entrance tour sell out fast! –> Click here to learn more about Walks! Context Travel Context offers comprehensive history food and cultural tours all around the continent. They are long intellectual walks packed with information. Context hires experts to lead these tours e.g. a chef for a food tour which is why they are some of my favorites. They aren’t cheap but they are worth every penny if you’re serious about getting beneath the surface of a destination. Expect to pay around 100 EUR per person. Context also offers amazing private tours and you can book customized tours as well if there is something specific you’re interested in. –> Click here to learn more about Context! THE BEST MULTI-DAY TOURS IN EUROPE Busabout Busabout is a hop-on hop-off bus service that is popular with the backpacker crowd looking to meet and connect with other travelers. You can purchase tickets that let you travel the whole network with a set number of stops and you can get on and off whenever you want. The only downside to Busabout is that if you want to visit a city not on one of its routes you have to make your own way there at an additional cost. But if you are looking to meet lots of people and not spend too much time worrying about your itinerary then this is a great affordable option. –> Click here to learn more about Busabout! Viking River Cruises With multiday and multi-week itineraries to choose from this is a solid option for anyone looking for a hands-free” trip around Europe. Much like ocean cruises with Viking you simply need to book your cruise and go along for the ride.

You’ll also get free Wi-Fi free port excursions onboard meals and 24-hour concierge. –> Click here to learn more about Viking! Intrepid Travel When it comes to multiday or even multi-week guided tours Intrepid Travel is my go-to choice. I’ve been going on their tours for years I just went on a trip to Jordan with them and I’ve yet to be disappointed. The guides are excellent the company offers amazing off-the-beaten-track itineraries and it is committed to the local environment and support local communities. Their small groups ensure you’re never on one of those giant bus tours either. BONUS As a reader of this site you’ll get discounts on some of Intrepid’s tours.

Shall we go somewhere else?” my friends asked. Sure let’s get the bill!” I replied. When our check came I was reminded of something about Sydney I had forgotten its high prices. Even with a currently weak Australian dollar Sydney was more expensive than I remembered. With its 10 AUD sandwiches 10 AUD beers 19 AUD cocktails 30 AUD hostels sometimes up to 40 AUD!!! and outrageous restaurant prices Sydney can burn a hole in your wallet quicker than actual fire. It was going to be an expensive two weeks if I didn’t figure out how to enjoy the best this city had to offer on a budget. Leaving no stone unturned OK probably one or two I found several ways to save big here – while still filling your days and having a lot of fun. While Syndey is never going to be the cheapest destination to travel to in the world there are plenty of ways to save money in Syndey thanks to all the free and cheap things to do there. Between museums markets beaches nature walks and some local deals there are plenty of ways to lower your costs on your next visit! I’ve divided this blog posts into two sections Part 1 Free things to do in Sydney Part 2 Cheap things to do in Sydney Just click on the link above and get to the section you want! Free Things to Do in Sydney 1. Get an Opal card This metro card is free — you just need to load it with money — and worth using for three reasons it offers discounted fare compared to purchasing one-use tickets this varies by distance there’s a maximum fare charge of 15 AUD per day and on Sundays the maximum is 2.50 AUD. That means you can go anywhere on the transportation system – whether by metro ferry or light rail – and you’ll never pay more than 2.50 AUD! It’s an amazing deal. 2. Explore the free museums Australia has a lot of expensive museums but tons of free ones too. Some worth considering are The Mint a small exhibit on how they used to make money The Australia Center for Photography The White Rabbit Gallery beautiful art The Manly Art Museum The Sydney Observatory The Rocks Discovery Museum! 3. The Art Gallery of New South Wales The Art Gallery of NSW is one of my favorite museums in the city. There are so many exquisite landscape paintings portraits and statues in its collection by Australian and European artists and even a few by Monet. It’s a really substantial collection. Some of my favorites were Albert Hanson’s Pacific Beaches” Guerard’s Jebel Cherib” and Milford Sound” Peter Paul Rubens’ Self-Portrait” and Batten’s Snowdrop and the Seven Little Men.” 4. The Museum of Contemporary Art The contemporary art museum also is free and features Australian artists including many Aboriginals. While I’m not a huge fan of this type of art bottles on the floor is NOT art the Aboriginal collection was breathtaking. You can really feel the artists’ connections to their land and culture as well as the pain of past attempts to take it away from them. 5. Visit the beaches Sydney is a city famous for its free beaches and there’s no better way to spend one of the city’s many sunny days than by enjoying one of them. Try to avoid going on the weekends when they fill up and you have to fight for space. While Bondi is the most famous be sure to check out some of these other great beaches Manly Watson’s Bay Coogee Bronte my favorite 6. Take a nature walk There are a number of stunning public coastal walks that allow you to take in the breathtaking natural beauty of Sydney’s harbor and coastal cliffs. While tons of people do the two-hour Coogee-to-Bondi walk avoid it on the weekends I found Watson’s Bay and the Split-to-Manly walks quieter more relaxing and beautiful. Some other walks worth checking out are Rose Bay to Watson’s Bay Watson’s Bay to Dover Heights Chowder Bay to Balmoral Beach Jibbon Beach Loop Track 7. Free walking tours One of the best ways to explore a new city is by taking a free walking tour. These will introduce you to all the major sites and give you a solid introduction to the city’s history and culture. Best of all these tours are free just make sure to tip!. Two suggested companies for walking tours in Sydney are I’m Free Walking Tours Daily tours of the city center and The Rocks Sydney’s original settlement. Sydney Greeters This is a free service that connects you with locals who will show you their neighborhood advanced booking required. Cheap Things to Do in Sydney 8. Take the Town Hall tour Built in 1889 Sydney’s beautiful town hall is a picturesque Victorian building. On Tuesday mornings there’s a detailed two-hour tour that you can take for only 5 AUD. It’s a great way to learn some extra history about the building as well as the city. 9. Visit the markets Sydney has a ton of amazing markets to walk through. No matter what you’re looking for from antiques to food to local crafts you’ll likely be able to find it at a market. I love the Paddington Market and the farmers market the best.

Avoid the expensive stuff In many parts of the world the high end offers some value and you can walk away from an expensive meal and say that was worth every penny!” However that’s not often the case in Sydney. I was always disappointed. From cocktail bars to upscale steak and sushi dinners I always left hungry unhappy and thinking about the lack of value I got. Stick to beer wine and the low-end restaurants when you’re in town. You’ll get more bang for your buck! 13. Visit backpacker bars for cheap drinks Drinking in Sydney is expensive – with beers costing up to 10 AUD each – but the backpacker bars are where to go for a cheap pint.

I was in Sydney staying at a friend’s house so that helped to save big on accommodation. But I can’t believe he didn’t suggest I get the Opal Card! 🙂 And so are the Museum and the Art Gallery free? We haven’t checked any during my stay but I’m sure I’ll hit Sydney again in future. Reply Anca April 7 2016 at 1119 am Wow I didn’t know those prices are that high. Even though there are tons of free stuff paying 10$ for a beer hurts 🙂 Sydey you won’t see me yet. Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 958 am I’d been in Australia for about three days went for a beer for my 20th Birthday and paid $14 for a Heineken. I nearly had a heart attack haha. Reply J April 7 2016 at 103 pm I have a soft spot for Sydney after living there for a year. It’s definitely expensive though I’ve done most things on the list. There are some amazing hikes that are parts of major routes even 45 minutes out in the Hornsby/Mount Colah area. Reply Shandos April 7 2016 at 639 pm I’m from Sydney and am used to Americans saying how expensive it is so was surprised that when I recently visited Hawaii it was more expensive than I expected. Sure there were some cheap cocktails but most food truck and cheap” road side stop meals fish tacos coconut shrimp burgers were about $14 USD about $20 AUD once converted and that’s if a tip wasn’t expected more expensive than in Sydney. Is it just Hawaii? Would love to do a road trip around the US in the next few years and hoping food elsewhere is cheaper! Reply J April 7 2016 at 1116 pm Hawaii is definitely considered to be more expensive than the mainland. As budget family travelers I didn’t actually find it to be too bad the 2 times we’ve gone. However we don’t go out much. Bars restaurants Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 1004 am For America it’s just about being patient and searching out a bargain. You’re a captive audience in Hawaii you can’t really escape it and it thrives on tourism. But if you were in say San Francisco even thought it’s an expensive place to live and work you can turn a corner and find a really cheap taco or BBQ place where you can spend $6-8 on a full meal. Reply Angeli Gette April 7 2016 at 726 pm I am glad you got to visit Sydney my hometown it is definitely expensive but it is a great place to live and work. Wages are higher as well so it is relative to the earnings and there are always cheaper options. You’re definitely right – higher price does not mean that it is going to be great. I’ve been disappointed many times with over-priced meals which were crap. I’d rather just a regular meal instead of the fancy stuff. I love Sydney but my husband and I are heading off to be digital nomads on Tuesday. First stop – bangkok. Thanks for the great content Matt. Reply Nicole April 7 2016 at 813 pm As a Sydney sider it’s quite funny to read this.I would normally think $10 is a bargain lunch haha but yes it is quite expensive now that I think of it. Some other free things that are worth doing is visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens or Centennial Park. Fun for a picnic/bike ride/walk. Good way to waste some hours and feed some ducks. Reply J April 7 2016 at 1122 pm Going to Sydney for the first time this year. It’s going to be a long flight. I’m going to the symphony at the opera house and I didn’t think tickets were very expensive. Free stuff will definitely also be on the agenda too. Reply Victoria April 8 2016 at 308 am Thanks for the tips Matt! I haven’t been to Australia yet but will keep it all in mind. I think the prices are reasonable for a nation such as Australia but of course if one goes there straight from Asia it’s an awful shock! Having said that I’m with you on the point that spending lots of money doesn’t necessarily mean better quality and it should! p.s. If doing a world trip with Australia New Zealand & South East Asia it’s best to start with the more expensive countries first and then work your way down rather than the other way around! Reply Bruno April 8 2016 at 854 am Great tips and thanks for showing exploring Sydney on a budget is possible! Reply Stephen Gollan April 8 2016 at 953 am Great look into Sydney! Its always good to see what other enjoy about a location that is quite traveled by many. Love the tips on how to visit Sydney on a budget. Sydney is a very expensive destination for most. So these tips can allow those on a tight budget to see this wonderful city! Thanks Matt Reply Kate April 8 2016 at 212 pm Getting a local train or transportation pass is always a GREAT way to save. We did that in Brussels Tokyo Bangkok and London. You can save $20-50! I’d also suggest just buying food from a grocery store you can make your own food for much cheaper. Or I suppose it’s never too late to go on a fasting diet . Reply Indrani April 8 2016 at 1152 pm These tips are going to get me richer. I don’t believe in splurging while traveling these tips are sure helpful. Reply Sophie April 9 2016 at 224 am Awesome guide! I’m going to Sydney in August and it will definitely be on a budget so this will come in handy 🙂 Reply Mia April 9 2016 at 654 am I couldn’t agree more! I used to live in Australia for 1.5 year and all that I would hear about Sydney is how expensive the city is. When I eventually came to visit Sydney I made an effort to mix in a few really cheap activities to keep the cost down. I quickly realized that the city has a lot of really cheap or free activities to do. Reply Sebrin April 9 2016 at 239 pm Oh man Sydney is such a killer! But I love these tips. I was lucky to do some of them like the nature walks and visiting the markets. It was perfection and it doesn’t feel like a free” type of event. Thanks for sharing Matt! Reply Lilly April 10 2016 at 238 pm Very helpful information Sydney is definitely on my to do” list but i haven’t been yet because of the high costs. This will surely help. Reply KD April 11 2016 at 801 pm At around 4pm most restaurants offer half price on their meals. I can sometimes get a bento box for just $5. So watch out for those. Reply James Johnson April 13 2016 at 952 am I found that the ferry across to Manly is a great way to take in a lot of the sites that you don’t really need to see up close for the couple of bucks that it takes you to get on there and go across. Plus Shelly Bay in Manly is one of the best free excursions you can do on. Also the Pylon Lookout next to the Harbour Bridge is a nice little but of insider-knowledge if you want a similar view but want to save yourself $230 AUD on going up the bridge. I think it cost me about $15 to get up there this was in 2012 but it satisfied me and my budget just as much. Thanks for the article Matt 🙂 Reply Wai April 14 2016 at 945 am The best way to survive in Sydney is to go with friends and rent an apartment. In september I rented a great apartment that could easily sleep 4 in Bondi for only $110 per night. Cheaper than a hostel and much more comfortable! Cooking at home and beers from the bottle shop will save you heaps. The cheapest food when I was there was definitely the sushi rolls that you can find everywhere. Around $3 for a roll and you can have lunch for $6-$9 depending on how much you eat. Reply Alegna January 26 2017 at 740 pm Don’t forget to go to the BYO restaurants. The cheaper restaurants either don’t charge corkage or it’s minimal. Reply Ryan Biddulph April 14 2016 at 832 pm Hi Matt We’ve passed thru Sydney twice. Once going to and from Fiji. We paid $100 USD for a room about as big as a shoe box right by the airport. Tis what it tis right? Overall a fab city and hey it’s the cost of living bit. Even if we paid $22 for a 3 minute taxi ride to the airport Sydney is A-OK with me. Signing off from sunny NYC. Ryan Reply Rekha April 18 2016 at 716 am I have found your post informative. This post is quite helpful for budget travelers like me. Being a nature lover and history buff I would like to visit nature rich destinations where I can capture the natural beauty of the places. I found you have mentioned about the same in your post. May I have some more information about hill areas around Sydney where I can explore the natural hill surroundings? Reply Cindee June 14 2016 at 339 am Two of the best things to do for free or almost free is to walk over the harbour bridge there is a pedestrian path along the side and take the circular quay to manly ferry. Reply Mike July 11 2016 at 514 am Great post Matt especially like the part about hitting up the backpacker bars for a cheap drink. I find they usually offer a better atmosphere as well. I have also found some pretty good drink/ food/ tourist deals on a Facebook page called – Sydney Deals. It’s worth checking out if you’re going to be in Sydney for a while and want to save some money! Reply john August 2 2016 at 106 pm I love Australia went I traveled there in 2012. specially Sydney it was my final stop after a year being there to perfect way to end I remember walking under the harbor bridge and seeing the Sydney opera house looking back at me it was like seeing a mirage walking through the desert. An incredible feeling. Reply carl January 4 2017 at 253 am Hi Matt I can relate to your blog post Australia is a way more expensive than the other countries I have visited. But places here especially in Melbourne Sydney and Tasmania is really great. I will surely go back when I can afford to visit again hehe When I visit Melbourne and Sydney I accommodate Serviced Houses apartments are really expensive but this one is great and worth it for only $25 per night. Ohh one thing I love about visiting Sydney is the Bondi Beach! The experience is really awesome. Reply Rosie May 8 2017 at 145 am Great tips Matt. Many backpackers/travellers ignore or put Sydney at the end of their travel list because it is expensive. However there are actually lots of inexpensive places events and food to look forward to. Reply Kate July 23 2017 at 745 pm Yes on a second thought Australia is one of the expensive places to visit or to travel. All you need to explore things where you can go on the travel on a budget and still enjoying at the same time. Reply Andreya September 9 2017 at 139 am Awesome post. Really Australia is one of the most expensive places. And we can get the most memorable moments and we can enjoy a lot . Reply Sam November 5 2017 at 1117 am Being a Sydney Sider I can vouch for the fact that if you are not thinking about your entertainment budget it can be a super expensive affair. Simple things like having drinks in an average bar can cost well over $50 AUD. That’s why I think this is a brilliant article and it can help the tourists and the locals to enjoy Sydney and without spending too much. Reply Morkal February 16 2018 at 607 am Hey Matt! Thanks for amazing tips. Yes Australia is a great country and Sydney is one of the most expensive cities in Australia. We all can control phone cost shopping cost hotel rent control and food cost But we skip the cost of flight tickets. If anyone wants to control this cost then Sekap travels is one of the best options for you as per my view. Sekap travels provide you cheap flight tickets for Australia at a reasonable rate. Reply Lisa C April 11 2018 at 1011 am I will be in Sydney for the next 2 weeks with my fiance…no kids!! Thanks for the great tips on what to do in Sydney if you’re on a budget…We are going to try more than one of them. Reply Steve A September 29 2018 at 330 pm Matt heading to Sydney next sat oct 6. Your tips of what to do cheaper are awesome. I like the hints on how to do the twin without breaking the bank. Most appreciated my good man! Well done. Reply DJR November 8 2018 at 421 am The roof of The Museum of Contemporary Art is also one of the best views of the Opera House.

I’ve been going there for over nine years and have yet to tire of the history the charm or the food and wine!. Over the years I’ve taken a million different tours of this amazing city to learn more about what makes it tick. For four months earlier this year I lived in Paris and had the opportunity to check out even more walking tours. And there were a lot to check out! There are dozens upon dozens of companies covering all aspects of life in Paris and it can be hard to make a sense of all those endless Viator and Tripadvisor listings. It’s obscene how many tour companies there are. I mean I’ve tried so many tour companies and I STILL have more on my list to try and some to retry. But I still feel like I’ve done enough to warrant a post on some of the best walking tour companies in Paris so today I want to share with you my top favorites Best Overall Tour Learn More Take Walks What makes Walks amazing is that they get better access than most tour companies and hire specialized guides. You get to skip the line go before or after other tours so you have the space to yourself and get fun guides who are knowledgeable in their field. They also have a nine-hour full-day tour of the city for anyone looking to really explore it’s a great option if you’re short on time but still want to see everything. Their tours are reasonably priced and their guides always know their stuff. I’ve gone on three of their tours and loved them all. Best Free Tour Learn More New Europe Tours New Europe is one of the most popular free walking tour companies in all of Europe. Their main free tour takes you around the center of Paris and gives you a historical overview of the city. They also run a good but paid tour of Montmartre and they have a really fun pub crawl as well if you’re looking to hit the bars with other travelers. While those may be the best free and paid tours in the city Paris has a lot more to offer — no matter your interests. Here are 10 other insightful and educational tours in the city! 1. City Free Tour This free-tour company like New Europe offers a couple great general tours to help you get familiar with the City of Light led by a local expert who can answer your questions. They also offer a few specialized tours so you can really focus on different neighborhoods. For example the Montmartre tour does a great job of showing you just what life is like in this famous bohemian neighborhood while the Latin Quarter tour highlights some of the most famous landmarks in town.

A recommended tip of 13 EUR is suggested. For the paid tour options prices start at 25 EUR per person. —> Click here to book your tour with Discover Walks! 3. Localers Localers are a great choice if you’re looking for a unique tour option and want something more nuanced than just a free walking tour. They tend to specialize in more niche tours like literary art or historical tours. I enjoyed their tours a lot. I hadn’t heard of them before I moved here and was bummed their tours had flown under my radar for so long. The World War II tour is particularly insightful and does a great job of illuminating the war’s true cost to Paris. I also really liked the Scandalous Paris tour which highlights Paris’ brothels and more colorful past. There’s also an insightful literary tour too that takes you through the literary history of the city’s left bank. This is a solid mid-range tour company for travelers looking for value. Tours last 2-5 hours. Tickets start at 58 EUR per person. —> Click here to book your tour with Localers! 4. Context Travel Context Travel hires experts in their fields so that every tour is an incredible educational experience and you’ll go much deeper than any free walking tour does. I am always shocked by how much I learn! I particularly love the Paris Market Tour and the Versailles Tour which is four hours long but you learn a ton. Context isn’t cheap and the tours are usually long — but they’re worth every penny if you’re serious about really learning a lot. Tours start at 100 EUR per person. They include a maximum of six people at a time. —> Click here to book your tour with Context! 5. Fat Tire Tours Offering cycling tours of Paris Fat Tire Tours are probably the best bike tour in town. I don’t think I’d go with anyone else. Their bike tours are the best. Do their Versailles tour – and try to do it on Sunday or Tuesday when they stop at the market that is open then and if you can check out their Monet’s Garden tour where you can cycle around the gardens of the famous impressionist while exploring the charming village of Giverny. Most tours last 2-3 hours though there are several full-day options available too. Tickets start at 34 EUR per person. —> Click here to book your tour with Fat Tire Tours! 6. Paris by Mouth Paris by Mouth company offers a handful of neighborhood tours that highlight the best food in Paris. The groups are kept small no more than eight people and they are really focused on providing a lot of information on food history and culture. It’s like a mini-class more than it is a chance to just eat food though you do that too. The tours aren’t super budget friendly but if you’re looking for a really detailed food tour this company would be it. And if you’re a diehard fan of French cheese like I am they also have an entire workshop just for cheese. It’s amazing. Tours usually last around three hours. Tickets start at 110 EUR per person. —> Click here to book your tour with Paris By Mouth! 7. Secret Food Tours While not the cheapest Secret Food Tours offers neighborhood-specific food tours. They also have a dangerously delicious pastry and chocolate tour that will take you around to half a dozen bakeries and shops to give you a firsthand experience of Paris’s love of decadent desserts. You’ll get A LOT of food during the tour so come hungry. Be sure to avoid Monday tours when most markets are closed and you end up just eating in one location instead of going from shop to shop. Tours last 2-3 hours. Tickets start at 89 EUR per person. They can sell out weeks in advance so be sure to reserve early! —> Click here to book your tour with Secret Food Tour! 8.

Posted 1/6/2020 | January 6th 2020 Chile is one of the most popular destinations and one of my favorites in South America. I was blown away by the beauty of the country the delicious and inexpensive the plethora of different eco-systems and how hospitable the locals were. And as someone who works online how much they are investing in tech! Owing to its diverse geography the country offers a lot to visitors. From exploring the wilderness of Patagonia to tasting wine at boutique local vineyards visiting the bucket-list favorite Easter Island exploring the Atacama Desert hanging out in the vibrant capital of Santiago — there are endless reasons to visit Chile. But with recent protests concern over safety has become a topic of concern among travelers. While Chile is not a dangerous country and the news media overblows everything there are some things you do need to be careful about when you visit Chile. The tips below will not only help you learn more about how to deal with the risks there but they’ll make sure your experience is as enjoyable as possible. 8 Safety Tips for Chile Like anywhere else you need to be vigilant and take a few precautions. Here are my top eight safety tips for Chile 1. Be aware of your belongings. Petty theft is going to be your biggest concern in Chile especially in the larger cities. Since these types of crime are usually situational and occur on a whim don’t make yourself a target keep an eye on your belongings and avoid carrying or wearing expensive accessories as well. Having been almost robbed in Colombia I can tell you that it’s not a fun experience! Be aware that there might be teams of thieves working together one will try to distract you while another steals something so be careful if a stranger tries to get you into conversation in a busy place. This is most common on the bus. There are other popular scams all designed to distract you such as the bird poo” scam where someone squirts a gooey liquid on you and then they or an accomplice rob you while you’re trying to clean it up or figure out what’s going on. 2. Don’t pet stray dogs. I know dogs are super cute. But the number of stray dogs in Chile has been increasing and quite a lot of them have scabies which is a highly contagious disease. If you come across dogs who look like they have skin problems make sure not to touch them. 3. Watch out for riptides and currents when you swim. Chile has lots of beautiful beaches but unfortunately many of them have dangerous offshore rips. It’s easy to get swept up in these and not be able to swim back to shore. Watch for signs on beaches that say no apto para bañar” or peligroso” meaning it’s too dangerous for swimming. 4. Double-check your taxi driver. There have been some incidents of people being robbed by unlicensed taxi drivers including in what look like airport taxis. Don’t hesitate to use pre-booked taxis or to check that the taxis you use are officially licensed ones. When going out ask your hostel or hotel to book your taxi for you as well. 5. Be prepared for an earthquake or volcanic eruption. Chile is located in a highly active seismic zone and earthquakes are relatively common. Make sure you familiarize yourself with any safety or evacuation procedures at your accommodation. If you’re hiking be aware that earthquakes can trigger landslides. 6. Watch out for drink-spiking. There’s been an increase in reports of people having their drinks spiked in recent years. Victims become unconscious and may have their belongings stolen or worse be assaulted or raped. Be especially carefully in the Suecia and Bellavista nightclub areas of Santiago but it’s good practice in general to avoid accepting drinks from people you don’t know and to keep your drinks in sight at all times. 7. Look out for the car tire scam. In the larger cities there have been incidents wherein tourists driving rental cars have a sudden puncture because thieves have surreptitiously slashed a tire and then their belongings are stolen while they are distracted by the puncture. Keep a good eye on your stuff if you should mysteriously get a flat tire! 8. Buy travel insurance! Whenever you travel you should always have an appropriate level of travel insurance because you never know what might go wrong. While you hope that nothing will happen you’ll be grateful you have travel insurance if you are the victim of theft get sick or injured or find yourself in an emergency situation. Trust me I’ve been there on more than one occasion! — having insurance makes a difference. Always buy travel insurance before you go! FAQ on Staying Safe in Chile Now that you know how to stay safe in Chile here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions I get about safety there Should I be worried about the current protests in Chile? Starting in the fall of 2019 anti-government protests erupted in the capital in response to policies that increased subway fares and then became general protests about the increased cost of living privatization and inequality. Parts of the capital Santiago erupted in flames and the protests got violent. However while the scars of those incidents are visible everywhere and there are frequent protests they are no longer violent and are shrinking in size as the government gives in to certain demands. Moreover these protests are confined entirely to the capital so once you leave Santiago you won’t notice anything going on. If you’re going hiking in Patagonia or out to the desert or even to the nearby town of Valparaiso you won’t notice anything. If you’re concerned about the protests skip the capital. But know the country is still safe to visit! Are there places to avoid in Chile? Not really. You’ll want to be more vigilant in the busier areas of cities like Santiago and Valparaiso where petty theft and tourist scams are more likely to occur. There is no reason to avoid these places — just keep your guard up and your possessions secure. There are also some areas of Chile where you can come across unexploded landmines but that’s only near the illegal border crossings into Peru Bolivia and Argentina so you should make sure you only use the official border crossings and avoid straying into the nearby countryside at these crossings. If you see a landmine warning sign don’t ignore it! Is Chile safe to travel alone? Solo travel is as safe in Chile as any other kind of travel and you should just take the usual extra precautions when traveling alone anywhere. The biggest problem will be making sure you keep an eye on your luggage and valuables at all times especially on public transport. But it’s still quite safe for solo travelers! Is it safe to drive in Chile? Chileans tend to drive quite aggressively so this might put you off from renting a car in Chile. It’s also tough work driving in Santiago because the traffic is always really busy and pedestrians will run across roads without checking. The highways are well maintained with tolls. Once you’re off the main roads however the secondary roads are often not well maintained and are poorly lit so you will need to be more careful. If you’re driving in the mountains you’ll soon see that the hillside roads don’t have the guardrails you often see in other countries. So as long as you have experience and are comfortable in a more hectic environment then go for it! If you’re not used to driving in countries with more lax rules of the road I’d advise against renting a car. Is it safe to walk around Santiago? Chile’s capital Santiago is a large city with well over five million inhabitants and so like many big cities there are parts that are perfectly safe and there are parts that might be a little dangerous. The Las Condes Vitacura and Providencia areas of Santiago are known to have higher rates of petty theft than other parts of the city so be extra cautious when in those areas. Is the water safe to drink? The tap water here is generally considered safe but it never hurts to boil your water to be sure. Boiling for 1-3 minutes depending on the altitude will ensure your water is safe to drink. You can also use a Lifestraw or SteriPen to purify your water as well. You’ll definitely need a water purifier for when you hike in the mountains down south where it is not safe to drink the tap water or from a stream. I used a Lifestraw when I went. Is Chile safe for solo female travelers? There is no special risk for female travelers in Chile although like in many parts of the world you should probably avoid being alone in empty or dark places at night. Women are also most likely to be victims of drink-spiking especially if you’re on your own at a bar or club. However many women go backpacking alone in Chile and for the majority of them the trip is uneventful. While you might be traveling solo you will also most likely end up making some like-minded friends. Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel Women Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Travel Alone **** So is Chile safe? Yes! And you must visit! It is an amazing country whether you’re interested in the natural wilderness want to head out to Easter Island or are keen to experience the culture and vibe of Santiago. Just be aware of scams meant to distract you and use some common sense. Chile is safe to visit. And the amazing sightseeing culture and people will make your trip well worth it! Book Your Trip to Chile Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. I use them all the time. My favorite hostels in Chile are Hostal Forestal Santiago – Great staff great breakfast and a fun atmosphere. What more do you need? Hostal Po Valparaiso – This hostel was opened by a former backpacker so they know exactly what we travelers like. It has a cool quirky ambience and a fun rooftop common area that’s great for hanging out and meeting people. Kona Tau Easter Island – This rustic hostel has a laid-back vibe and the owner and staff go out of their way to make sure you have a memorable relaxing experience. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. I’ve been using World Nomads for ten years. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are World Nomads for everyone below 70 Insure My Trip for those over 70 Looking for the best companies to save money with?

Thank you for showing people that Chile is actually safe to visit! 🙂 We’ve just been to Chile and have seen many protests in person. Unfortunately the protests do not only take place in Santiago de Chile. They take place in every major city and even in Patagonia now. For example Valparaiso was completely destroyed and when we arrived in Punta Arenas Patagonia the entire city was protesting and many buildings were destroyed and burned. It would be great if you could edit this information so people won’t be surprised by the protests. However we’ve seen many many protests in Chile during our travels and as long as you don’t go outside after 5 pm you will be safe even in Santiago! Safe travels Denise & Ryne Reply Priyanka Gupta January 15 2020 at 314 am I agree with Denise and Ryne. The protests were going through entire Chile even on islands and in the remote Andes. In some places they were peaceful that’s all. I talked to many locals in Chile and met travelers who just had been to Chile and they all said the protests were too bad in most parts. Thanks for inspiring me to write an article about the travel safety in Chile 🙂 Reply Janet February 23 2020 at 515 pm February 23 2020 Hi Matt Are there protests still going on in Santiago and other parts of Chile?

Boston has been a commercial hub since the 17th century and holds an important place in American history. After the Boston Tea Party in 1773 it became a pivotal bastion of support for the US War of Independence. Even today the city is brimming with history and has lots to offer. It’s a must-visit destination for anyone looking to understand the roots of modern America. Since it isn’t the most affordable destination budget-conscious travelers and backpackers are probably going to want to save money however they can. That means finding budget-friendly accommodation. Like most US cities Boston doesn’t have many hostels. But the ones it does have are modern clean safe and social for the most part. That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Boston are Location – Boston is a big city and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Boston you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service.

Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Tropical jungles bursting with wildlife mountainous landscapes extending into the horizon picture-perfect beaches on both sides of the country and a never-ending supply of fun activities no matter your budget. Costa Rica is a nature-lover’s paradise — and it’s one of my favorite countries in the world too. It was the first country I ever traveled to and it was the country that sparked my wanderlust. The beaches feel like paradise there’s great surfing diving and plenty of places to get away from the hordes of retired Americans that live here. No matter what your interest there are tons of things to see and do in Costa Rica without breaking the bank. But is Costa Rica safe to visit? The country was fortunate to escape the Cold War conflicts and brutal gang violence that impacted other countries in Central America. However in recent years Costa Rica has become more involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. But the country is super safe for tourists. At worst you’ll get scammed for a few bucks. I mean the country is so safe it doesn’t even have an army! While Costa Rica is one of the safest countries for travel and backpacking in Central America that doesn’t mean you should let your guard down. Here are some tips to guarantee a safe and stress-free experience 1. Avoid isolated areas – If you’re somewhere isolated you’ll be at a greater risk for getting robbed especially at night and in big cities. Try to stay where the crowds are. That’s the best way to avoid being singled out by potential muggers. 2. Don’t wear flashy items – Petty theft is common here so remove any jewelry or watches and don’t wave your phone around. Do your best to blend in so you don’t become a target for pickpockets. If you happen to find yourself a victim of a robbery follow the instructions of the robber and give up your valuables these material items can be replaced but your life cannot. 3. Don’t leave your items unattended – If you are spending the day on the beaches in Puerto Viejo Santa Theresa or Manuel Antonio do not leave your belongings unattended while swimming or walking along the sand locals or tourists alike can easily take your valuables if you leave them around. Just take what you need with you and nothing more. 4. Be alert when using public transportation – Petty theft including bag snatching is the most common type of crime you’ll face in Costa Rica. Most of the theft in Costa Rica occurs while taking the bus. Keep your bag containing valuables and identification on your lap and stay vigilant. 5. Always take an authorized taxi – Crimes against cab riders are infrequent here but it’s best you use a licensed taxi. Also pay close attention to the meter and make sure it’s running. Cab drivers can turn the meter off and claim it’s broken a common scam see below. 6. Buy travel insurance – This is especially important if you plan to join in on activities like ziplining white water rafting or surfing. Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70. For more information on tarvel insurance check out these posts What Does Travel Insurance ACTUALLY Cover? The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance How to Avoid Scams in Costa Rica There are really only two common scams found in Costa Rica 1. Taxi Scam You hop into a taxi and realize the meter isn’t running. You mention this to the driver and their response is the meter is broken” and quotes you a price that is outrageously high. Or you might notice that the meter is working but the fare is increasing faster than a running cheetah. Do your research and get an idea of how much a ride should cost from your hostel or hotel staff before hailing a taxi. In my experience if the cabbie tries to negotiate the rate I use the rate quoted to me and if they refuse I get out and find someone who will turn the meter on. If the meter looks as though it’s rising unusually fast ask the driver to pull over and get out immediately. 2. The Cheap Tour” Scam You’re exploring the sites and sounds of the city and a well-mannered nicely dressed person approaches you and asks if you’re looking to go on a tour. They do a fantastic job describing the most unforgettable trip you’ll ever take in your life and at a fraction of the cost of other tour companies. You’re sold and hand them a deposit. You wait the next day for them to pick you up but no one shows up. You realize there was no amazing tour at 50% less you’d been tricked. To avoid this scam only use authorized companies when booking tours. Your hostel/hotel can always help you and if you plan to book through a tour company check their online reviews ahead of time. Never trust someone trying to sell you a tour on the street who does not have an official office or storefront. These scams are the most common ones you’ll face while in Costa Rica. If you’re worried about scams read this post on travel scams to avoid. Avoiding travel scams requires a lot of common sense and a healthy dose of suspicion. Zika Risk in Costa Rica While there are no reports of a Zika outbreak in the country Costa Rica has had reported cases of the Zika virus. While risks are low travelers are advised to take the following precautions Use mosquito repellent on your body to prevent bites and sleep under a mosquito net to avoid getting bit while when you’re asleep Wear breathable garments that cover your arms and legs if you’re wondering what you should apply first apply sunscreen first followed by repellent. Keep doors and windows closed as much as possible to prevent mosquitos from entering your room Pregnant women or couples considering pregnancy should consult a healthcare practitioner prior to travel FAQ on Costa Rica Safety Here are the most common questions I get asked about staying safe in Costa Rica and my answers to them Is Street Food in Costa Rica Safe? In Costa Rica street food is safe to eat and not to be missed! I’ve had my fair share of empanadas fresh fruits from open markets and other local foods and have been perfectly fine. That being said if something doesn’t look cooked through such as chicken or has been out in the sun for too long then trust your gut and don’t eat it. But I would encourage you to try the street food as it’s the best way to experience the cuisine and support local businesses plus it’s cheap! Is the Tap Water Safe to Drink in Costa Rica? The tap water in Costa Rica is safe to drink however it’s recommended that you avoid drinking the tap water in most beach destinations. The best way to make sure your drinking water is safe is to bring a SteriPen or LifeStraw for your reusable water bottle. This way you’ll be able to purify the tap water so you don’t get sick — and avoid using single-use plastic bottles in the process. Are Taxis in Costa Rica Safe? The taxis in Costa Rica are safe and reliable though you’ll always want to make sure you’re getting in an authorized taxi. During the day you can hail a taxi from the street safely but make sure you pay attention that the meter is turned on and running properly. If you’re taking a taxi at night it’s best to have your accommodation call it for you. That will ensure you get a reputable company. Never hail a random taxi at night. As mentioned earlier taxi drivers will occasionally try to take advantage of travelers by overcharging them. Always remain alert and if anything feels suspicious ask the driver to stop the cab and get out. Don’t take any chances with your safety. Is Costa Rica Safe for Solo Travelers? Costa Rica is a safe country to visit for solo travelers. As long as you stay away from isolated areas don’t wave your valuables around and don’t travel alone at night you will be able to avoid the most common dangerous situations. Additionally be sure to download offline maps and an offline language app like Google Translate so you can look up directions if you get lost or communicate with the locals in an emergency. If you can try to learn some Spanish before you go too. Even a few key phrases can go a long way! Is Costa Rica Safe for Solo Female Travelers?

They went ziplining for the first time and seemed like it was very fun. When they went to a zoo a monkey known as the spider-monkey used its tail to knock the phone off of my head and hit him a couple of times through the fence that it was being held in. I actually sent them the link to this before they went over to Costa Rica but whether or not they actually looked at it is beyond me but thanks anyway for making this keeping me well informed if I ever go there someday! Reply Diego February 28 2020 at 1109 am Great post as always! 🙂 Costa Rica is definitely a safe country but it is better to take some precautions. Keep your eyes open if you are visiting San Jose or Jaco. Reply Nick R. March 10 2020 at 1140 pm Sadly Costa Rica has been experiencing major crime increases. It now carries a Level 2 Warning from the US State Department. Drug trafficking gangs drug usage missing females and of course the petty crimes that come with any 3rd World country. There has been an influx of criminal groups from neighboring countries that have brought this increase in crime with them. I’m a gringo who lives in San Jose with my wife and two boys. I enjoy Costa Rica but it has changed for the worse. It is extremely exasperating that the government keeps many things quiet as to not disrupt the tourist industry. This gives both locals and tourits a false sense of safety.

While not always for the better there is no question that it has allowed people to share connect and collaborate in ways that haven’t been possible. For budget travelers this change has led to a plethora of new money-saving and community-building apps and platforms that have made travel even more affordable and accessible. It’s never been easier to connect with locals get off the tourist travel and experience the local pace of life. To help you save money and connect with locals and travelers alike here are the best sharing economy platforms for travelers. Hospitality Networks Hospitality networks have been around for decades but they didn’t get popular until the creation of Couchsurfing. Founded in 2004 this was one of the first sharing economy platforms to change the way people travel. Couchsurfing connects travelers with locals who are willing to give them a free place to stay couch room floor etc.. In addition to accommodation travelers get a local perspective on a destination. It’s meant to be used as a form of cultural exchange and is used by travelers of all ages and families too!. Couchsrufing popularized hospitality networks and with millions of members all around the world it’s easy to use and find hosts pretty much anywhere. And if you don’t want to stay with locals you can use the app to meet other locals and travelers for coffee a meal a visit to a museum and other fun activities. There are always meet-ups posted on the platform including lots of language exchanges and it’s easy to find travel companions on the app as well. My Community Manager has used it to find road trip companions on a few occasions. But there is more than just Couchsurfing out there. Other hospitality exchanges worth checking out are Be Welcome Horizon Global Freeloaders Warm Showers for cyclists Purple Roofs for LGBTQ travelers House and Pet Sitting One of the most recent areas of the sharing economy to see major growth has been house sitting and pet sitting. As more and more people travel there is a growing demand for house and pet sitters as most people can’t bring their pets or farm animals on a trip with them. On the other side of the coin more and more travelers are looking to travel slow. There are also tons of digital nomads out there who need long-term bases to work from as well. House sitting and pet sitting websites like Trusted Housesitters have done an amazing job at connecting these two demographics. Much like Airbnb there are profiles ratings and reviews to ensure the platform is safe for everyone involved. I know bloggers who travel exclusively via house sitting cutting their travel costs by as much as 30% a year! If you’re looking for a unique and fulfilling way to travel slow try pet sitting. Because who doesn’t want to spend their time with cute animals? Other house and pet sitting webistes you can use are Rover HouseCarers Mind My House Housesit Match Apartment Rentals and Paid Accommodation Hotels are expensive. Maybe hostels aren’t your thing. So what’s the next best choice? Renting someone’s apartment or a room in it! On apartment sharing/rental websites you can rent a room couch or whole apartment at much cheaper rates than a hotel room. Plus you’ll have a local host to answer your questions and a kitchen to prepare meals. It’s the best middle ground between hostels and hotels. I think Airbnb offers the most robust inventory for finding a spot in someone’s house and I prefer them the most. That said Airbnb is far from perfect. However it’s important to always compare rental sites because unlike hotel sites where properties appear over multiple websites listings are at the owner’s discretion and some owners list their property on only one site. If you’re new to Airbnb get $35 off your first stay! Similar services to Airbnb include Wimdu HomeAway Campspace formerly Camp in my Garden FlipKey Eat With Locals Like apartment sharing there are now meal-sharing sites that connect you with local cooks. EatWith lets locals post listings for dinner parties and specialty meals that travelers can then sign up for. You can pick from a variety of meals in each destination with each meal uniquely designed and priced like Airbnb hosts choose their own prices. Since each cook has their own specialties you can find a ton of variety on this platform. The dinner parties are intimate insightful and are a unique opportunity to do something different pick a local’s brain and make new friends. Similar services include Meal Sharing Traveling Spoon With Locals food tours Colunching Taxis In many countries around the world taxis are incedibly expensive. As a budget traveler you likely avoid taking them as much as possible. However every now and then we all need one. Instead of calling a regular taxi use taxi ridesharing apps to save you money. Lyft is available around the world and is an affordable option of budget travelers. Uber is the other main option. It’s usually a little bit more expensive than Lyft but the cars are nicer and the service a little more professional. Both options will save you money especially if you use the pool” option to share your ride with other potential customers. If you choose Uber use code jlx6v to save $15 off your first ride. Other apps that replace taxis are DiDi Gojek Southeast Asia Gett UK Israel Russia Car Rentals Need a car for a few hours — or a few days? Rent someone else’s! Turo which is available in the US Canada the UK and Germany allows you to rent people’s unused cars by the hour or by the day. Prices are usually cheaper than your traditional rental and you’ll have much more variety too. Car rental platforms are great for short rentals where a traditional company might be inflexible or overpriced. Other car rental apps worth checking out are Getaround CarHopper luxury cars in large US cities Drivy RV Share for RVs Trailer Made For trailers and camper vans Rideshares Rideshares are a convenient and cheap way to travel medium and long distances. Instead of taking the train or a bus you can use ridesharing apps to find locals and travelers who you can for a small fee share a ride with. It’s a popular option in Europe and while usually not as cheap as the bus it’s often much faster and more comfortable. Drivers are vetted and verified and it’s a much better way to get out of stuffy trains and buses meet interesting characters and take a mini-road trip. It’s one of my preferred methods of travel. The biggest player in this space is BlaBlaCar which is huge around Europe and a couple other parts of the world like India Turkey Mexico and Brazil. If you’re traveling on a budget and want to have a more memorable experience try a rideshare. It will save you money time and you’ll have a much more interesting experience! Some other good ridesharing companies GoCarma Liftshare based in the UK Gumtree UK/Australia/NZ Kangaride Canada Roadmate NZ Share Your Ride Global Craigslist Volunteering/Work Exchanges If you’re looking to travel long-term but don’t quite have the savings consider a work exchange program. These usually entail volunteering at a hostel farm school or NGO in exchange for free accommodation and often free food as well. Positions can last for a couple of days to a couple of months there is tons of variety in the lengths of time as well in the positions available. You can find opportunities in pretty much every country and city in the world too. Worldpackers is one of the best platforms to start your search in. You simply pay to sign up most work exchange websites charge a nominal fee and then you’ll get access to their database. You can search for opportunities read reviews and contact hosts directly to plan your next exchange. If you’re on a budget and want to extend your travels this is one of the best ways to boost your time abroad. Other great work exchange resources are Helpx Workaway WWOOF *** The rise of the sharing economy” has made it so much easier for travelers around the world to connect with each other — and save money in the process! But more than just saving money these platforms allow better access to destinations promote new interactions offer unique opportunities and create nuanced and intimate travel experience. On your next trip be sure to give the sharing economy a try. You’ll learn much more about the culture and destination save money and have a much more memorable experience. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.

Reply rebecca February 18 2014 at 229 pm thanks for the great links and resources. So many of these I didn’t know of Reply Dave Briggs February 18 2014 at 340 pm Hospitality networks have been a great development. I would just like to mention Warmshowers which is a cyclist hospitality network proving useful for thousands of bicycle tourers all around the world. Reply Saul February 18 2014 at 513 pm Great article! I’ve been using many of these sites for a while now. Hadn’t heard of Camp in My Garden though which sounds awesome! Over the past few years I’ve pieced together a living as an Airbnb host TaskRabbit and DogVacay sitter while also renting out my car on RelayRides. Lots of opportunities here! Reply Paul February 18 2014 at 725 pm Hey Matt Great article with a ton of resources. While going through it I noticed you missed out on BlaBlaCar an excellent resource used in Europe for sharing rides with drivers. It’s much more economical than booking a last-minute train. Reply Catherine February 19 2014 at 427 am Had only heard of Couchsurfing and Airbnb before didn’t realise there were so many other great resources out there! Thank you very much for sharing going to get these added to my favourites right away – EatWith in particular sounds like such a great idea! Reply Rachel February 19 2014 at 741 am I have heard of these before but it’s nice to see them in one post I can bookmark 🙂 Sadly so many of these I can’t use in India. For example I LOVE couchsurfing but have kind of quit it lately here. I’ve also wanted to try InterNations. Reply Parul February 19 2014 at 1151 am Hey Rachel You can actually use a lot of these in India. If you are in Hyderabad do give me a shoutout plus I’ll treat you to a home cooked meal You can look me up in mealsharing. Matt Thanks a lot coz I was looking to start a home restaurant and this is like the perfect time and post. Parul Reply David February 19 2014 at 1234 pm Great List Matt. I am a big fan of collaborative consumption. I’ve used several services from your list. And learned about a few new ones which I will soon try out… We at HitTheRoad.ca like to think of ourselves as part of the sharing economy too. Carsharing meets road trip. It was my experience in the sharing economy that got me thinking about new venues. David Reply Cyra February 19 2014 at 237 pm Wow there is some great information in this post. I was aware of quite a few of them but Vayable is a new one to me. I am going to have to check that out. I actually booked my first Eat With dinner the other day it’s for next week so I haven’t tried it out yet. But I will be in a city on my own so I decided it would be a good opportunity to try something new! Incidently this same city i will be staying in a room from Airbnb. 19 euros for a private room instead of the 30-40 euros that hostels were charging for a bed in a dorm! I do love Airbnb. Reply Paul February 20 2014 at 452 am Matt just want to say thank you for posting these awesome options for budget travel. These tips could make an enormous difference in my ability to travel long term. Thank you!!! Reply Victoria February 21 2014 at 129 am Thanks for this post Matt. As I’m from Britain although I live in Germany LOL I have heard of some of these websites however Eat With Locals” and Get a Personal Tour Guide” sounds great and something that I could look into in the next few months. Reply Michael Matti February 21 2014 at 341 pm Good to know as I plan a two month trip to Europe for this spring. I was planning on using couch surfing and AirBnB but now may have to look at some of these other sites too. Reply Joel Stephenson February 22 2014 at 303 pm Great advice! Couch Surfing is pretty amazing. Wherever you go even my small village in England there seems to be somebody willing to host you. Workaway.info is pretty amazing too if you are willing to work for your accommodation and food. Reply Frank February 24 2014 at 342 am This goes well beyond the usual Couchsurfing Craigslist  etc recommendations in posts like this … Eatwith sounds AWESOME and while I’ve known about AirBnB for a while now I’ll be using it when I get back to Canada for sure! Reply Rashad Pharaon February 26 2014 at 404 am Wow I definitely hadn’t heard of a LOT of these websites – thank you! Camping your way around Western Europe seems like a really fresh way to do the well-worn circuit. I also had a friend who cycled Europe and used CouchSurfing the entire time – she only paid for a hostel 2x in 3 months! Reply Aaron May 8 2015 at 949 pm Thanks Matt this article helped shed some light on these websites I knew nothing about. Upwork is also a great sharing economy website” If you have a digital project like website or app instead of getting a company to do it why not hire a freelancer instead! They are much cheaper and you don’t have to pay the other run off costs associated with a company. Also good if you are a freelancer as you can travel and work! Reply Matt January 25 2016 at 831 pm Good list – glad to be able to check out some alternatives to airbnb which I think has become much too commercial and rates are equal to or in some cases higher than hotels. Will be giving couch surfing a go later this year but note with interest they have now introduced a fee option as well for hosts Reply James McKenzie March 2 2016 at 446 am Recommend house sitting especially there’s a site called Trustedhousesesitters which is helping us travel all over the world and stay in really great places for free looking after pets. You get to meet the owners and their friends and enjoy living like a local in cool communities. Definitely money saving. Good for spontaneous travel too. Reply Kendal January 6 2020 at 1242 pm Hey Matt & readers I wanted to add two things to this great post! The app Yandex Taxi” is actually the best taxi app to use in Russian as well as in Belarus. It’s mega cheap for a taxi service and works just like Uber. Additionally BlaBlaCar is often better to use than the buses/marschrutkas in Ukraine! So for anyone going to Ukraine check out BlaBlaCar. A lot of people will start their own shuttle” service using this app. Hope this helps!

It’s a scenic country full of rolling green hills photogenic cliffs impressive castles cozy Irish pub friendly locals and a lot of Irish charm. I’ve loved every part of my experiences in Ireland. My first trip was a quick 24-hour visit to Dublin but I loved it so much I’ve gone back about four times since. Ireland has a special magic to it that makes every visitor fall in love. Ok not everyone but most people love it here! While the cities are incredible and have a lot to offer Ireland is best seen by car so you can get off-road and visit the small little villages castles and parks that dot the country. However if you’re like me and not a fan of driving especially driving on the left! the next best thing to driving or just city hopping on buses is going on a tour in Ireland. Given the country’s small size you can see a lot of it in a little time and a tour can be a good way to pack it all in without the hassle of organizing all the details yourself. There are lots of tour options here — from walking tours in Dublin to multi-day tours around all of Ireland. Here is a list of my favorite tour companies in Ireland each of which have something unique to offer 1. Historical Walking Tours of Dublin The city of Dublin is such a fascinating place to explore and it’s full of historical spots that you might just wander past if you’re not with a guide from Historical Walking Tours of Dublin. They’ve been operating tours since 1986 and one of the reasons they’re so good is their guides all have postgrad history qualifications – but also know how to lead a tour with a good Irish sense of humor. Each walking tour is just over two hours long and they start from the front gate of Trinity College at 11am every day with an extra tour at 3pm from May to September. They’ll take you to many of the highlights of Dublin like the House of Lords Temple Bar Christ Church Cathedral and Dublin Castle and you’ll end up with a great overview of Irish history. Tickets are 14 EUR. 2. Paddywagon Tours An Irish born-and-bred tour company that started in 1998 Paddywagon Tours offers both day tours for lots of popular tourist attractions in Ireland as well as multi-day tours ranging from two to nine days long with accommodation choices ranging between B&Bs and hostels. If you’re time-pressed and looking for some day trips from Dublin to quickly see a bit more of Ireland Paddywagon has trips to places like the Cliffs of Moher the Ring of Kerry and even up to the Giant’s Causeway and other highlights of Northern Ireland. Costs range from 45 EUR to 65 EUR for these trips. They also run day trips out of other centers like Belfast Limerick and Cork. Paddywagon’s multi-day tours range from 149 EUR for a two-day trip up to 689 EUR for their All Ireland nine-day tour with backpacker accommodation or 999 EUR if you want B&B stays. Even though you could easily spend a month in Ireland given its relatively small size you can actually get a lot out of nine days. If you’re a student they also run some student special trips at even lower costs so keep an eye out for them. 3. Shamrocker Adventures Shamrocker is a great option for budget travelers looking for multi-day tours of Ireland. Their approach is to try and combine the best of independent travel and group trips. That means they give you choices like different levels of accommodation and you can self-cater when it comes to food. They also have great guides who are passionate Irish storytellers — even their bus drivers have a great sense of humor! Tours range between three and seven days with the shorter trips focusing on just one part of Ireland — the south or the west — and costing around 300 EUR per person. Shamrocker’s seven-day trip covers all the main sights like the Giant’s Causeway Cliffs of Moher Galway and Blarney Castle and is 609 EUR for adults and 589 EUR for students. 4. Wolfhound Adventure Tours Wolfhound Adventure Tours is a boutique tour company run by Trinity College history-graduate Dave O’Connor. Tour groups have a maximum of 12 travelers and tours include some biking and hiking which are optional but definitely a big part of the fun. Tours range between five and ten days — the shorter tours give you an option of going to the north to the Giant’s Causeway or heading west to see the Cliffs of Moher and the Aran Islands both of which are 985 EUR. Wolfhound trips can include kayaking horseriding whale watching and even surfing lessons and are a great choice for anyone looking to get active! 5. Vagabond Tours Vagabond Tours is an Irish company and offers two kinds of small group tours Driftwood Tours if you want to take it easy and Vagabond Tours which include activities like hiking sea kayaking and cycling. Tours range in length from six to eleven days and in price from 1550 EUR to 2900 EUR per person. They have some of the common itineraries such as a Northern Ireland tour taking in the Giant’s Causeway and Belfast and the Giant Irish tour which circumnavigates the country but they also have a few specialty trips like a foodie tour an adventure trip which includes a visit to the Skellig Islands and a tour for history buffs focusing on castles and kingdoms. Rob Rankin co-founder of Vagabond Tours is a huge advocate of responsible and sustainable tourism and the leader of Ecotourism Ireland and Vagabond Tours has been eco-tourism gold-certified since 2017. 6. Extreme Ireland Extreme Ireland offer adventure tours around Ireland with several Wild Atlantic Way trips available ranging from six to 12 days long. They take small groups a maximum of 16 travelers led by skilled guides who have all the skills necessary to help you have a safe and adventurous tour. Their 12-day trip will take you all over Ireland — it doesn’t just show you the regular sightseeing highlights!.

And one of those goals usually involves trying to travel more. But when you are starved for time and money travel can seem like a pipe dream. A wish that might never be fulfilled. Luckily there’s a wave of positive developments for those who want to travel more cheaper airfare more deal-finding websites and other information online free walking tours in more cities and more opportunities to bypass the traditional travel infrastructure and connect directly into the local way of life via the sharing economy. So as we get deeper into 2020 I want to share some suggestions on how to travel on a budget this year so you can check off that New Year’s resolution! Here are some of my top tips to help you 1. Change Your Mindset Changing your mindset might not be a traditional budget tip but it’s important nonetheless. Action begets action and as you think of ways to travel cheaper it becomes a game where you try to keep finding ways to save money. The first step makes all the other steps easier. Start with a yes I can” mindset. Don’t think I can’t travel” — think What’s one thing I can do today to make my trip closer to reality?” Life is a mental game. Do one thing every day that gets you closer to your trip and you’ll find yourself building an unstoppable momentum. 2. Come Up with a Savings Plans Unless you’re Bill Gates we all need to save more money. But how do you do that? While life is expensive I do believe there are always ways to save a little more. There’s always something you can cut. A little bit of savings adds up a lot over time. Get into the habit of putting money into your travel fund regularly — even if it’s just a few dollars a week. Every little penny will help. The more you save the more you want to save. It sort of becomes a game. It’s no longer a chore. Here are some posts on how to save money 22 Ways to Cut Your Expenses and Have Money for Travel The Ultimate Guide to Traveling Cheap How Michael Saved $14k in 6 Months Making $9 Per Hour How I Find the Money to Travel 3. Score a Flight Deal One of the things that people always tell me holds them back from traveling more is the cost of flights. But let me tell you we live in an age of cheap airfare. If you can be flexible with your plans there are always deals. Sure maybe you can’t take advantage of that sale to Europe next week but you can still find a date and a destination that work for you at a great price if you’re flexible about one or both factors. I like to use Google Flights. I type in my home city and then everywhere” and see what the cheapest results are. I then base my plans around where I can fly to for the least amount of money. However if you don’t want to do that I think it’s a perfect Friday night activity you can check out some of the following websites that search for deals and email them to you Scott’s Cheap Flights – The best website for finding flight deals from the US The Flight Deal – Incredible deals for flights all around the world Secret Flying – Another site with amazing flight deals from around the globe they find a lot of Asia/Africa/South America deals not found elsewhere 4. Get Points! Travel hacking the art of collecting points and miles is a great way to save money. By getting point-yielding credit cards and using a few ninja techniques you can get hundreds of thousands of miles without spending any extra money thus getting you free flights free accommodation and added cash back. It’s what all serious travelers do. There’s no excuse not to do it! I mean you’re spending the money anyway so you might as well get some treats for it. Here are some resources to help you begin How I Earn 1 Million Frequent Flier Miles Every Year The Ultimate Guide to Picking the Best Travel Credit Card The Ultimate Guide to Travel Hacking Even if you aren’t American you still have options as points and miles have gone global Points Hack Australia/New Zealand Head for Points UK Canadian Kilometers Canada 5. Use the Sharing Economy The sharing economy has led to a plethora of new money-saving and community-building platforms that have made travel even more affordable personal and accessible. It’s never been easier to get off the tourist trail connect with locals and experience their pace of life. I live by these websites when I travel! You should too. My favorites include Airbnb – The best platform for finding rooms apartments and homes for rent by locals. Couchsurfing – Great for finding free accommodation often on people’s couches and meeting travelers/locals. The hangout feature on the app is my favorite as you can see who is around to meet up. Trusted Housesitters – The most comprehensive website to find house-sitting gigs. You watch a place on vacation while the homeowner is on vacation. EatWith – Allows you to eat home-cooked meals with locals it’s the Airbnb of food. It always leads to interesting encounters so it’s one of my favorite things to do. BlaBlaCar – A ridesharing app that pairs riders with verified locals who have a spare seat in their car. 6. Find the Free! The world is awash with amazing free travel resources like this website that can help you travel on a budget. No matter where you are going there’s probably a blog post on what to do and see there for free or cheaply. Someone has been there and they’ve written about it! Make the best use of all them to help you plan your trip. My favorite search term is free things to do in X.” You’ll always get a result! Additionally don’t be afraid to walk into a hostel — even if you aren’t staying there — and ask them what to do for cheap. Their clientele is budget sensitive so they always know what to do and where to go for little money. 7. Stick to Public Transportation If you’re on a budget skip the taxis and rideshares like Lyft or Uber. Unless you can lower your cost by sharing a ride with other passengers public transportation is going to be the most cost-effective way to get around. Not only will it save you money but you’ll get to see how the locals travel too. Google Maps usually can give you a basic overview of the public transportation options and prices available. You can find information about day passes and/or multiday passes local tourism offices which will save you even more money. See the next tip for more about that. 8. Use Local Tourism Offices Local tourist offices are a wealth of knowledge. They exist solely to provide you with information on what to see and do. They often have tons of discounts not found anywhere else and can also keep you updated on local events free tours and the best spots to eat. They can help you find public transportation discounts and/or multiday passes too. Don’t skip the local tourist office! They are serverly underutilizted resource. 9. Get Cheap Accommodation Accommodation is one of the biggest fixed costs travelers have so reducing that cost can lead to big savings on the road. I’m sure many backpackers would sleep in a barn if it were the cheapest accommodation they could find! Heck I’ve slept in hammocks in national parks to save a buck! Since you have to stay somewhere every night reducing this expense can save you a lot of money off the total cost of your trip. Stay in hostels use Couchsurfing get last minute hotesl on Hotels Tonight stay at universities yes you can do that or try an Airbnb. Since there’s a lot of ways to cut your accommodation costs here are my posts on how to get accommodation deals How to Find the Perfect Apartment Rental How to Find Cheap and Free Accommodation How to Crush it on Couchsurfing And here are the websites I use to book cheap places to stay Booking.com – For finding budget hotels and guesthouses. Hostelworld – The best site for finding hostels. Agoda – Another great hotel website specifically for Asia. Hotel Tonight – Offers discounted last-minute hotel stays. Airbnb – For finding private rooms entire apartments and homes for rent by locals. 10. Eat Cheap Other than accommodation food is one of the biggest travel costs. After all everyone needs to eat. But there are lots of ways to eat on the cheap Go grocery shopping and prepare your own meals Shop at local markets Use apps to find deals Yelp Seamless LaForchette TasteCard RiceBowl Also use the five-block rule. There seems to be this magical wall that surrounds tourist areas. Most people don’t go past it. It’s been my experience that if you walk five blocks in any direction from a major tourist area you end up losing the crowds and finding the local restaurants. Tourist restaurants don’t care about quality since tourists aren’t coming back. Residents do care so places catering to them need to be better — and more affordable – or they go out of business. Those are the places you want to eat at. Use the above resources to find where the locals eat and avoid crappy food! Moreover check out these articles for tips on eating cheap around the world How to Eat Cheap Around the World How to Eat Around the World on a Plant-Based Diet 11. Travel Like You Live The majority of people in your destinations don’t spend lots of money per day like tourists do. Neither do you in your day-to-day life. So take that mentality with you. Walk take public transportation grocery shop spend a day in a park and look for deals. Do the things you do at home every day to keep your costs down. Too many people get into this mindset that when they go on the road they just have to spend spend spend spend. That’s not true at all. There’s no law that says you have to spend more. Be smart with your budget — just like you are at home. That will help you save money and prevent you from going home early broke. *** The world is full of different ways to travel on a budget once you know where to look. This year make travel happen. It doesn’t matter if you save only a dollar a week. What matters is that you take the first step! Action begets action. Once you take the first step all the other steps will be easier. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.

It’s also one of the cheapest countries in the world. I didn’t have high expectations when I first visited in 2006. Back then all I knew about Cambodia was its awful history involving the Khmer Rouge and that it was home to Angkor Wat. But I was blown away by the people and their warmth spirit and hospitality the beautiful natural scenery and the country’s long history. It was wonderful and I ended up staying weeks longer than I thought I would I especially loved Phnom Penh. I returned often including spending over a month there when I was writing my first book. It made for a great base of operations. In the last decade or so Cambodia has grown by leaps and bounds. Sleepy little towns I visited before are now megacities tourists especially Russians and Chinese visit en masse there are more ATMs there was exactly one in the country when I first went and there’s a growing expat and foodie scene. Cambodia still has problems but it’s a lot more cosmopolitan today than when I first went. What should you do when you visit Cambodia? How should you plan your trip? Below are some itineraries that include the best destinations in Cambodia. You can use them as a guideline to help you make the most of your trip! What to See and Do in Cambodia A One-Week Itinerary Day 1 – Phnom Penh The capital of Cambodia Phnom Penh has a Wild West ambiance with dusty streets and a devil may care” atmosphere. It has a few good attractions and an up-and-coming foodie scene. The main attraction is the Royal Palace. Start there and don’t miss the beautiful flower gardens and the Silver Pagoda whose floor is made up of more than 5000 silver tiles inside is an emerald-covered Buddha and a diamond-covered Maitreya Buddha. It also has murals around its outer wall that tell the story of the Ramayana. On the palace grounds are five stupas with the two largest to the east containing the ashes of King Norodom and King Udung the two most famous kings of modern Cambodia and a statue of King Norodom on horseback. Admission is $10 USD for foreigners. After seeing the palace learn about the country’s tragic not-too-distant history. The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is a former school where the Khmer Rouge interrogated and tortured people in the 1970s. You’ll see rusty beds and torture devices in sharp contrast to the beautiful trees and lovely jasmine smell in the gardens. Admission is $5 USD for adults and $3 USD for anyone under 18. Afterward head to the Killing Fields about 14km from Tuol Sleng. Although a visit to Choeung Ek the best-known site may not be the most cheerful way to spend an afternoon it makes for a hallowed and memorable experience a testament to the dangers of uncontested power. You won’t believe the memorial building in the center that is filled with skulls. Admission is only $3 USD expect to pay at least $15 USD for a return-trip tuk-tuk ride. Tip Visit the museum before heading to the Killing Fields as it will open your eyes to the atrocities that happened here. Where to Stay in Phnom Penh Sla Boutique Hostel – This is a pretty nice hostel not far from restaurants bars and attractions. It’s clean and the beds are comfy and have privacy curtains. The staff especially Mr. Star are super friendly and they can really help you plan your trip. Day 2 – Phnom Penh Spend your second day wandering around the city and start by seeing the Independence Monument designed by architect Vann Molyvann and inaugurated in 1958. It was created to mark Cambodia’s independence from French rule though it also serves as a de facto war memorial. It’s one of the biggest landmarks in the city and a good place to start your day. If you’re in the city on a weekend try to catch an architectural walking tour with KA Tours which has excellent guides who are students or experts in architecture plus they’re not very expensive at around $15. Check out the Cambodian Living Arts Center a traditional dance school and performance center where you can watch students in training and see traditional live theatre. This is a fun way to spend a couple of hours while learning about the artistic traditions of the country. You can also take part in a workshop which last around 90 minutes and cost $15 USD per person. Make sure you stroll along Sisowath Quay on the Mekong River. The 3km walkway is busy and full of restaurants bars cafés and shops. Day 3 – Sihanoukville Get an early start and take a five-hour bus ride to Sihanoukville named after the ruling prince of Cambodia in 1964. It was a lazy beach town until about 2010 when it took off with travelers and tons of Chinese and Russian tourists on package tours because of its white-sand beaches nearby deserted islands excellent diving and delicious seafood. Its varied nightlife filled with cheap booze makes it the premier backpacker party city in Cambodia. If you’re looking to soak up some sun Independence Beach and Otres Beach are probably your best bets. Serendipity Beach used to be a great party spot but there’s a lot of Chinese development going on now so I wouldn’t stay there. Where to Stay in Sihanoukville Monkey Republic – This hostel is awesome. It’s a happening place with a bar restaurant and pool. The staff is really friendly and they host a lot of events. Say hi to Aaron for me! They can also organize a lot of day trips for you too. Day 4 – Sihanoukville Today is a day for day trips. From Sihanoukville hop on a boat and take a 45-minute ride to Koh Rong. While you can stay overnight if you’re pressed for time you can do it in a day trip. The beaches here are way better than on the mainland and a lot less polluted. Snorkeling day trips cost approximately $21 USD and include lunch and equipment there are PADI-certified schools in the area that offer a variety of different dive trips for one or more days. If you don’t feel like heading to Koh Rong you could book motorbike trip into Bokor National Park as well as longer multiday trips if you’re interested. There you can hike through a great rainforest or see the atmospheric ruins of the French aristocracy for whom Bokor was a big draw back in the day. You’ll have some amazing views and find ruins waterfalls and temples all around. You could also do a day trip to Kampot and the pepper fields in that area too. Day 5 – Siem Reap It’s gonna be a busy travel day. From Sihanoukville you’ll need to return to Phnom Penh and then get on another bus to Siem Reap. I recommend Capitol Tours. It’s a 12-hour ride so it’ll be evening by the time you get to Siem Reap. Note It’s better to take the night bus so as not to waste a day. You won’t sleep well but you also won’t lose a day! Siem Reap is located on the northeastern side of Tonle Sap Lake and is the main access to Angkor Wat. The center remains a rural old town with French-style houses and shops. The area around the Old Market is crowded with locals and foreigners all day long. Where to Stay in Siem Reap Topsky Hostel – This hostel offers basic accommodations in a pretty quiet area that’s not far from the action. Try to get a lower bunk with a privacy curtain. The friendly staff will help you arrange a tuk-tuk and activities too. Day 6 – Siem Reap Spend your day at Angkor Wat the ancient city that was the center of the Khmer Empire that once ruled most of Southeast Asia. The temple was built in the 12th century and covers over 500 acres. The most popular temples are Angkor Wat Bayon Ta Phrom and Angkor Thom. I would recommend getting a multiday pass so you can visit some of the outer temples where there are fewer visitors. You can hire a tuk-tuk for the day for around $20-25 USD or rent bicycles and explore on your own. Angkor Wat is open daily from 5am to 6pm. Admission is $37 USD per person for a day pass $62 USD for a three-day pass and $72 USD for a seven-day pass. Day 7 – Siem Reap Enjoy your last day in Cambodia by exploring more of the Siem Reap area. Head over to the Angkor Wat complex for several more hours in the morning and then head over to astonishing Banteay Srei. Known as the city of women” this temple was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and features a number of outstanding red sandstone statues. You need an Angkor Wat Pass to visit. If you have time visit Tonle Sap Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake. It is 52km 32 miles from Siem Reap. Sailing down the river and around the lake gives you a look at how closely Cambodian life is tied to this major waterway. Tours start around $2.50 USD per person. What to See and Do in Cambodia A Two-Week itinerary Want to spend more time in Cambodia? Great! You should! There are tons of other places to visit. Here are my suggestions Days 1 & 2 – Phnom Penh Follow the Phnom Penh itinerary from above. Day 3 & 4 – Sihanoukville Follow the Sihanoukville itinerary from above. Day 5 & 6 – Koh Rong Head out to Koh Rong which got its name after the legend of a giant King Kong–like ape that once called the island home. It’s a 45-minute trip from Sihanoukville and a great place to relax on the beach or go snorkeling. There are a lot of accommodation options and it’s a popular spot with backpackers. Day trips costs around $25 USD and include lunch and snorkeling equipment but since you have the time spend a few nights here relaxing and enjoying beach life. There are also other islands nearby if you want to stay longer and explore including Koh Rong Samloem which is becoming something of a backpacker paradise there’s even a Full Moon Party there now. Days 7 & 8 – Kep In the morning travel by bus to Kep which is about two hours from Sihanoukville. This quaint beach town and fishing village is the quiet version of Sihanoukville a nice place to relax near the ocean but without a party atmosphere. It’s famous for its pepper crab and empty beaches. Consider taking two full days here. Sure it’s quite sleepy and there’s not a lot to do but it’s the perfect place to relax eat all the delicious crabs the city is famous for and read a book. You can also spend some time on nearby Rabbit Island Koh Tonsay too a secluded and charming escape from the world if you’re looking to disconnect. Basic bungalows can be rented for under $10 USD per night. Where to Stay in Kep Khmer House Hostel – Kep is pretty spread out so wherever you stay make sure you rent a bike or scooter. This hostel is a good option as it’s not far from the Crab Market. Day 9 – Kampot The southern region of Cambodia is filled with pepper farms where you can learn about the history of the spice see how it is grown and pick up what is considered some of the finest pepper in the world. I’d spend one night in Kampot. It’s another quiet town on the coast. Most people come here to enjoy the scenic riverside views as well as the rolling hills that surround the city. The area used to be a getaway for the French so you’ll see old French architecture around. At night the street near the old bridge is lined with fruit shake vendors. Try a million. The city is famous for them. Also if you only do one thing in this entire itinerary make sure it’s eating the ribs at The Rusty Keyhole. They are some of the best ribs I’ve ever had in my entire life. You have to order them the day before. You’ll also get healthy side of mashed potatoes and coleslaw too. It’s one of the best meals I’ve ever had. I still dream of it. Where to Stay in Kampot The Magic Sponge – This is one of my favorite hostels in Cambodia. Make sure you book early as it tends to sell out. It’s a really nice relaxed guesthouse where you’ll get your own bed not a bunk. You’ll feel at home here and it’s a short walk to the center of town. The dorm rooms are very clean. They also have a little mini-golf course too. Day 10 – Kampot Today hire hire a tuk-tuk driver to explore the Kampot area. The Phnom Chhngok Cave Temple has a religious shrine inside or you can head out and spend the day in Bokor as Kampot is relatively close to the park. Days 11 12 & 13 – Siem Reap Follow the Siem Reap itinerary from above. Angkor Wat is best seen slowly so use your days to explore it as much as possible. There are a lot of out-of-the-way temples to visit that are free of crowds. Day 14 – Siem Reap On your last day in Cambodia why not take a cooking class? The class sizes tend to be around six people and you will learn to prepare three different meals as well as get recipe cards at the end. Prices start around $20 USD per person local guesthouses can help arrange a class. What to See and Do in Cambodia A Three-Week Itinerary Have even more time for Cambodia? Good! Cambodia has a lot more to it than the major spots on the backpacker trail. Days 1 2 & 3 – Phnom Penh and Kirirom National Park Follow the above suggestions but also head out to Kirirom National Park for a day trip. This park has all sorts of walking trails mountain biking trails waterfalls and a few lakes. It’s a good place to go to take a break from the city. The park is around a two-hour drive from the city so you’ll need to hire a driver for the day. The best way to do this is to find some travelers to join you so you can share a ride which will cost around $80 for the day. Days 4 5 6 7 & 8 – Sihanoukville and the Islands Follow the above suggestions but at a much slower pace! Days 9 10 & 11 – Kep and Rabbit Island Follow the above suggestions for Kep but head out to Rabbit Island for a rustic island getaway. Days 12 & 13 – Kampot Follow the above suggestions! Days 14 15 & 16 – Siem Reap Follow the above suggestions! Day 17 – Koh Ker For a fun day trip from Siem Reap head to Koh Ker located around 2.5 hours from town. Koh Ker was briefly the capital of the Khmer Empire and many of the temples here are over 1000 years old. It’s a massive archeological site located in the jungle and it sees far fewer tourists than Siem Reap. There are no public buses that go there the roads were only paved a few years ago so you’ll have to arrange transportation via your hostel or hotel. Day 18 – Phnom Kulen For another fun day trip head to Phnom Kulen considered the country’s most sacred mountain. It’s located just 50km from Siem Reap and offers some amazing jungles hiking and picturesque waterfalls where you can take dip to beat the heat. You can easily spend a day here. If you head up to the summit there are some great views as well as a large reclining Buddha statue. Try to arrive early as the park fills up by lunchtime. Admission to the park is $20 USD. Day 19 – Battambang From Siem Reap you can take a three-hour bus to Battambang. Or try taking a riverboat on Tonle Sap for a unique experience there is one boat per day with tickets costing around $20 USD per person. When you arrive you’ll discover Cambodia without the tourism. Get familiar with Battambang by exploring the town on foot or by tuk-tuk. Check out the Phsar Boeung Choeuk and Phsar Naht markets. You’ll also want to visit the gorgeous pagodas and temples such as Wat Pippitharam near the Old Market Wat Bovil Wat Kandal and Wat Damreay Sar. In the evening check out the Battambang Circus. The show is put on by students at a Cambodian nonprofit arts school so your donations go to a good cause. Where to Stay in Battambang Sophea Hostel – This is a good place to meet locals and make some friends. It’s family-run and they try to make you feel at home. The facilities are pretty basic but typical dorms. There’s a nice garden and sitting area. While there’s no restaurant on-site there are plenty of nearby options. Day 20 – Battambang Take it easy this morning by touring the town a bit more on foot. Check out the colonial architecture along the waterfront and the governor’s residence. This building from the early 1900s is not open but you can marvel at the exterior. While you’re wandering don’t miss the Art Deco central market building and the Victory swimming pool where you can take a dip if you’re in the mood. You may want to visit the Battambang Museum admission is just $1 USD and you’ll learn a lot about the history of the area. After lunch you should grab a tuk-tuk and head a bit out of town to check out Phnom Sampeu. Take about an hour to climb to the monastery on the hill. You’ll also find some caves in the area with Buddhist temples in them. There’s also another cave at the foot of Phnom Sampeu this is where you want to be around dusk when millions of bats fly out of the cave in search of food. It’s an incredible sight! Day 21 – Siem Reap or Phnom Penh Make your way back to one of these towns depending on where your flight is leaving from. Enjoy the bus ride knowing it’s your last in Cambodia at least for now! *** I always love my time in Cambodia. It lacks the polish of Thailand making travel here a little more rustic and challenging. But more amazing than any of the country’s sights and activities are the people. I’ve always found them to be incredibly welcoming. Even with so much darkness clouding their recent history Cambodians always go above and beyond making any trip here a memorable one. But don’t take my word for it. Come and see this incredibly country for yourself. And let these suggested Cambodia itineraries help you plan your trip!

The Tragic Death of Phnom Penh’s Lake Area Visiting Bangkok My Suggested 3-5 Day Itinerary There are 5 Comments jan May 4 2019 at 1059 pm I also love Cambodia. Like you I really enjoyed Phnom Penh and would love to stay there for a few months or more. Kampot is such a dreamy town beside the river and I enjoyed the cheap and cold Cambodian beer. So good! Loved the Battambang circus also. So many of the places you’ve talked about we’ve been and enjoyed. Koh Ker and Phnom Kulen are the exceptions though and if or when we return to Cambodia they’ll be on our list. Cambodia is one country where you just know you will have a bus story to tell! Reply Artur May 6 2019 at 1026 am Thank you for the interesting and useful article. I have already been to Cambodia but I see that there is a reason to return there again. I also liked the country very much although I think that it still needs a lot of time to recover from the tragic events of the past. Reply George Fox-Edwards May 7 2019 at 1123 am Very handy itineraries and nice that you space them out to cover various timescales. From my experience I’d suggest swapping out Sihanoukville for a day in Kampot and a day on either Koh Rong or Koh Rong Sanloem depending on how crazy you want your evening to be!. Kampot was one of my favourite spots and Sihanoukville has indeed been overrun by big tourist hotel/casino blocks 🙁 Reply Hayley June 30 2019 at 931 pm Hi Matt! This article has been so helpful planning my itinerary traveling through Cambodia. Thank you! I’ve seen a lot of travel blog mention that you don’t need riel as everywhere takes USD. I just wanted to pop in real quick and say that I’ve ran into multiple situations always outside of the city center where the locals do not take USD. This has been in both Siem Reap and Battambang and has happened at both restaurants and markets. I’ve also asked multiple Khmer people about which current to use and they said while most tourist places accept USA they would prefer if people used Riel because that is the official currency of Cambodia. Reply Carol Henshaw January 29 2020 at 516 pm Our guide in 2008 did not know how old she was. Her father a teacher & therefore an intellectual was killed by the Khmer Rouge Her mother died of starvation and she was brought up by an older woman in the village. In the Killing Fields we were walking over ground with scraps of fabric sticking out an indication you are walking over mass graves. The rest of the country was beautiful and very interesting.

Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 In recent years there have been a handful of countries that have emerged as exciting up-and-coming travel destinations. These are destinations that are affordable interesting unique and most importantly free from the hordes of tourists that have clogged the cultural arteries of cities like Barcelona Reykjavik and Venice. One of those countries is Georgia. Formerly part of the Soviet Union Georgia has become a popular destination in region for both backpackers and digital nomads alike. Tourist numbers are climbing fast with nearly nine million foreigners visiting Georgia in 2018. While the majority of them come from neighboring countries it’s also a destination that is quickly becoming popular with western tourists too. Tbilisi the country’s capital sees the most visitors — and for good reason. It’s a stunning city with a picturesque Old Town that has been colorfully restored in recent years. There is also lots to see and do in and around the city like exploring the Narikala fort ruins seeing the Jvari Monastery on the nearby mountain top and visiting the many beautiful cathedrals and churches that dot the city. Outside of Tbilisi travelers can explore the mountains and caves of Georgia’s picturesque landscapes and if you like wine you’ll be happy to learn that Georgia is actually one of the oldest wine regions in the world! Best of all Georgia is super cheap a huge plus in my book! But is Georgia safe? While there was some danger a decade back during the Russo-Georgian War Georgia is now a safe country to visit. In fact the International Crime Index rated Georgia as the seventh safest country in the world in 2017! But because many people don’t know much about Georgia I still get some messages from people asking about the safety concerns there. So what do you need to think about before you go to Georgia? Are there any places you shouldn’t go? The eight safety tips below will tell you all about the risks in Georgia and how to deal with them so that you can enjoy your trip safely. 1. Avoid South Ossetia and Abkhazia – The regions of South Ossetia on the Russian border north of Tbilisi and Abkhazia bordering Russia and the Black Sea in the far west of Georgia are not safe to visit. These are breakaway regions of Georgia which have experienced high conflict in recent years. There are still car bombs and other terrorist attacks reported periodically in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and there are unexploded landmines too. Just don’t visit the areas and you’ll be fine. Also don’t try to travel through them into Georgia from Russia as that’s illegal under Georgian law. 2. Stay alert – Like in any country where the locals see the tourists as being wealthier petty theft can happen. It’s a lower risk than in many countries but it’s still important to take precautions. Don’t wear flashy jewelry or watches or flaunt large amounts of cash. Keep an eye on your bags at all times too. The most common incidents occur in busy tourist areas or on crowded public transportation. If you can keep your guard up in these places you’ll be fine. 3. Beware of the bar scam – There are been reports of tourists in Tbilisi being scammed by locals who invite them into a bar for food and drinks and then force them to pay a really high bill. It’s not common here but it’s something to be aware of. 4. Be wary of demonstrations or protests – It’s quite common for political demonstrations to take place in Tbilisi and sometimes other parts of Georgia though they most commonly happen outside the parliament on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. While the most likely problem is just an interruption to public transport you should always be aware that protests can turn violent and it’s probably safer to stay away. 5. Be careful when driving – Unfortunately the road conditions in much of Georgia aren’t great. When combined with reckless driving from the locals traffic accidents are pretty common. Sometimes road markings are lacking and there is often confusion about which driver has right of way. When in a car always wear a seatbelt. Additionally avoid driving after dark as well as the lack of good lighting makes it even more dangerous. 6. Learn a few words or have a translation app ready – Georgians are usually really friendly but not many of them speak English. If something goes wrong they are always happy to help you out but you might need a few words of the local language or a good translation app to help you explain what you need. The Georgian language is pretty special – it’s one of the oldest in the world and it has a unique script. If you can learn a few words before you go. There are lots of free resources online and you can download Google Translate just in case you need to translate on the go. 7. Be cautious in the mountains – Georgia’s beautiful alps are making it a popular destination for skiing and mountaineering. But at the moment it’s still hard to get up-to-date accurate information about the weather conditions there so you need to be cautious. If in doubt skip the adventure for the day. Also although they’re improving the safety standards for adventure sports in the mountains in Georgia are still lower than you might expect. If you’re having doubts about an activity try using a specialist guide and check reviews for safety levels before you go. 8. Buy travel insurance – I never leave home without travel insurance. While most trips are uneventful it’s important to be prepared just in case. Travel insurance can save you hundreds and thousands of dollars and provide critical assistance in an emergency. Remember it’s always better to be safe than sorry! We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70.

The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance FAQ’s on Safety in Georgia To help you stay safe and make the most out of your visit here are some answers to the most common questions I get about traveling to Georgia Is Georgia dangerous to visit? Most parts of Georgia are extremely safe to visit. However you should definitely avoid the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions on the border with Russia. You should also be aware that the Pankisi Gorge area north-east of Tbilisi has been known for terrorist training and activity in the past although recent reports seem to suggest that it is currently safe to visit. Is Tbilisi a safe city? The Georgian capital Tbilisi is generally a very safe place to visit. Be aware that the drivers can be a little erratic so you need to have your wits about you as a pedestrian. There are also some reports of petty crime against tourists like pickpocketing in the main tourist areas so keep an eye on your belongings but the risk is lower than in many other European cities. Is the tap water safe in Georgia? While it can be reasonably safe to drink the tap water in some parts of Georgia and it’s sourced from freshwater sources in the mountains there have been incidents of travelers picking up giardia during their travels. Unfortunately this means it’s best to avoid the tap water while you’re here. The best way to make sure your drinking water is safe is to bring a SteriPen or LifeStraw for your reusable water bottle. This way you’ll be able to purify the tap water so you don’t get sick — and avoid using single-use plastic bottles in the process. Are the taxis safe in Georgia? Taxis are a common way to get around in Georgia and are usually quite. Just make sure you wear your seatbelt as drivers here can be aggressive and the rules of the road are interpreted more as suggestions than law. Be aware that taxis here don’t have meters so you’ll need to agree on a price in advance. Ask your hostel or hotel staff for advice about how much you should expect to pay before you catch a ride. That way you can avoid getting overcharged. If you’re a solo female traveler I’d avoid taking taxis alone at night but that’s my advice for pretty much every city. Is Georgia safe for solo female travelers? Given how safe Georgia is in general it’s probably no surprise to hear that yes Georgia is safe for solo female travelers. The usual rules apply though don’t walk alone at night beware of strangers offering your drinks or food especially in bars in Tbilisi and never leave your drink unattended. While it’s rare there have been incidents of drink spiking in Georgia. In short as long as you use the common-sense practices you use at home you should have no problems here. Here are helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel Women Shouldn’t Be Afraid To Travel Alone *** So should you visit Georgia? You can consider yourself very safe in Georgia. It might be a relatively unknown destination to travelers but that doesn’t mean it’s dangerous. Be aware of lower driving and road standards and take the usual precautions with your belongings — especially when you’re in a more crowded tourist area. Do that and you’ll have a safe trip to Georgia! Book Your Trip to Georgia Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation To find the best budget accommodation use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the most comprehensive inventory. Some of my favorite places to stay in Costa Rica Fabrika Tblisi – This hostel is also a bar and co-working space housed in an old Soviet warehouse. It’s got a cool vibe and the people here are wonderful. This is the best place to stay in the country if you ask me. Temi Hostel Kutaisi – This hostel is small but the staff are great and it’s clean and cozy. It’s in a great location too. Boutique Hotel and Medusa Hostel Batumi – This place is relatively new so the beds are comfy and have curtains and the place is well maintained. The staff are super helpful and will make sure you have an amazing visit to Batumi. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations.

I finally saw the light and came to love it. London has a million things to do to keep you busy a lifetime over. With its amazing architecture world-class art museums tons of historical sites and unique shopping experiences what’s not to love? What’s not to love about a city where the pubs are so small everyone just stands on the street with their pint glass?! And from its beautiful gardens to the excitement of Piccadilly Circus there’s just an energy that can’t be beat. But London is huge containing more than 8 million people and 48 neighborhoods stretching over 607 square miles. I mean it’s HUGE. Any city that warrants a I survived the subway” T-shirt usually is. Stay in the wrong neighborhood and you’ll spend hours on the tube.” So which are the best neighborhoods and places to stay when you visit London? That depends on a lot of things especially what your idea of fun is. Each neighborhood has its own charm. So I’ll break down the best neighborhoods and accommodations in London for travelers according to me The City of London This is technically the center of London sometimes called The Square Mile” and it’s where the Romans set up a small military outpost named Londinium in 43 CE. You can still see evidence of the Romans here including the crumbling wall on Tower Hill. Now the area a financial district. There are several good markets here like Whitecross Street with its large number of international food vendors the Sunday Upmarket in the Old Truman Brewery for handmade crafts and clothing and Leather Lane for a more traditional mix of everything from leather to tropical flowers. I like the history quiet and central location of this neighborhood. Best Places to Stay in The City BUDGET YHA London St Paul’s – Opposite St. Paul’s Cathedral this was once the school for the cathedral’s choirboys you can actually still see some of their graffiti on the walls. There’s no kitchen on-site but there is a small restaurant and bar. It’s not a party hostel as families often stay here. So it’s ideal for a good night’s sleep. MID-RANGE Citadines Barbican London – Renovated in 2017 this hotel is comfortable affordable and close to the Barbican tube stop.. There are some really great restaurants nearby like Tinseltown and Workshop Coffee but there is also a small Sourced Market in the hotel for when you need to grab something to eat on the run. LUXURY Counting House – The Counting House is actually an iconic English pub with 15 large luxury rooms above it with the most comfortable beds you’ll ever sleep in Egyptian cotton sheets!. Some rooms come with living rooms. A free hearty breakfast is included. This is a very traditional posh British hotel! Kensington/South Kensington If you have come to London to soak up British history or to indulge your love for all things royal this is the neighborhood to be. Kensington is where London’s Museum Quarter is including the Victoria & Albert Museum the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum. It’s really close to Hyde Park and the regal Kensington Gardens. I love to stroll the neighborhood and gaze at the mansion-lined streets. It’s quiet quant and classically British. Best Places to Stay in Kensington/South Kensington BUDGET Astor Hyde Park – This hostel is in a quiet neighborhood right off Hyde Park and within walking distance to the Natural History and the Victoria & Albert Museums. There’s a great social vibe and the friendly hotel staff will help you arrange tours and activities. Plus the £1 breakfast can’t be beat! I love the old wooden décor — you feel more like you’re in a home than a hostel. The dorms are huge and there’s plenty of room to sprawl out. Try to avoid the rooms on the upper floors though as the hostel has no elevator. MID-RANGE London Lodge Hotel – You can book single rooms in this bright Victorian townhouse while the executive rooms have more floor space and larger bathrooms. The rooms are each uniquely decorated to make them feel more like a home with colorful patterned wallpaper and carpeting and vintage furniture. LUXURY The Ampersand Hotel – The Ampersand is a luxury boutique hotel next to the South Kensington station. Each beautiful room has a different theme like music or astronomy and if you’re staying on the top floor you get a great view over London. They do a posh afternoon tea in the drawing rooms and you can play ping-pong in the games room. Mayfair Mayfair is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London. Located between Hyde Park and the West End it’s home to numerous five-star hotels classy art galleries and ultra-expensive shops but quiet at night. If you’re looking to stay in one of the city’s fancier and more beautiful neighborhoods this is it! Best Places to Stay in Mayfair BUDGET Mermaid Suite Hotel – There are no hostels in this neighborhood but the Mermaid Suite Hotel on Oxford Street is one of the best affordable options. You’ll get a private room with an en suite bathroom satellite TV and tea and coffee. There’s also a free continental breakfast. MID-RANGE Mayfair Guesthouse – Although all the rooms in this guesthouse are private and spacious some have balconies most of them come with shared bathrooms. It’s a really good value property for this part of town. LUXURY The Beaumont Hotel – Walking into the lobby is like stepping back into time. The walnut-paneled walls are covered in original classic paintings and photography and all the rooms are art deco style with king-sized beds. The marble bathroom floors are heated. Take advantage of the sauna steam room fitness center and hammam. If you’re going to treat yourself to dinner try the fresh lobster at the Colony Grill. Or you can pretend it’s the 1920s and order a strong whiskey cocktail in the low light of Jimmy’s Bar. Soho Soho is one of London’s most vibrant neighborhoods. The former red-light district Soho is home to hundreds of restaurants pubs stores all-night coffee shops and theaters. It’s eclectic and exciting and London’s artistic community thrives here. I love Soho at night when the pubs here spill onto the street with folks having a pint after work. You’re a twenty minute walk from a lot of the main attractions especially the theaters of the West End. This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city. Best Places to Stay in Soho BUDGET SoHostel – This large hostel I kept getting lost in the hallways has a rooftop tiki”-style bar nightly drink specials quiz nights live music and karaoke. It also has a big common space with a restaurant with cheap food like £5 pizzas and beer. The beds are comfy and the showers super clean. It’s one of the best hostels in London. If you book directly with them they often have special rates. MID-RANGE Mimi’s Hotel Soho – Mimi’s is a newer hotel and its affordability is based on its tiny rooms. They come in tiny” mini” cozy” and lux” but even the lux rooms are pretty small. On the other hand there’s floor heating specially filtered water and really nice marble bathrooms. The hotel’s on-street bar Henson’s gets really busy at night. LUXURY The Soho Hotel – No two guestrooms are the same at the Soho Hotel they’re also enormous and most have floor-to-ceiling windows. There’s a well-equipped gym and even a personal trainer on-site but if you’d rather take a book to the cozy library and read you can do that too. There are tons of restaurants bars cafés and theaters surrounding the hotel and Oxford and Regent Streets are both just a quick walk away. Covent Garden Covent Garden is just east of Soho. This is the theater district and is also known for its historic indoor market and throngs of tourists. There are plenty of street performers and lots of shopping opportunities. But it’s also a quirky neighborhood with cobblestone streets cool shops restaurants and a historic square. It’s also very central. Best Places to Stay in Covent Garden BUDGET Astor Museum Inn – Like the Astor Hyde Park the dorms rooms here are pretty basic but they aren’t overpriced are clean and there’s a cozy lounge and kitchen. Free dinners are also offered frequently. It’s not as quaint as the Hyde Park branch but it is a better location. MID-RANGE Strand Palace Hotel – This hotel has been around since the early 1900s and all its rooms are built around six inner courtyards. If you want a quiet space ask for a room overlooking the interior. There are single-room options too if you’re traveling solo and don’t mind a small space. LUXURY Fielding Hotel – The Fielding Hotel is named for author Henry Fielding and in keeping with the period the building has a lot of 19th-century charm. The rooms are tiny but they come equipped with large TVs and tea and coffee facilities and some even have claw-foot bathtubs. The hotel is located across from the Royal Opera House and just five minutes from the famous Covent Garden Market. Shoreditch/Spitalfields This artsy hip neighborhood in East London is an up and coming neighborhood filled with outdoor markets vintage clothing stores bars and restaurants and it’s one of the best nightlife districts in town. The abundance of street art contrasts old industrial warehouses and dimly lit streets. Thanks to the immigrant influence here you’re never too far from a döner kebab or a plate of Peruvian ceviche. Best Places to Stay in Shoreditch/Spitalfields BUDGET The Dictionary – The hostel itself has a great rooftop terrace a bar for drinks and free breakfast. There’s a big kitchen in case you want to cook too. The rooms are bare but they’re spacious and kept clean and the beds are fairly comfortable. MID-RANGE Brick Lane Hotel – This offers basic but very clean accommodations including single double and triple rooms with en suite bathrooms. Each room has a tea and coffee station and a desk.

Like Shoreditch it has a lot of vintage and unusual shops like Cyberdog the futuristic glow-in-the-dark shop that’s also part rave.

Best Places to Stay in King’s Cross/Camden BUDGET Generator – This is Generator’s first hostel it’s now a huge chain spread all over Europe and it’s housed in an old police station. You can’t go wrong with this chain. Like most of their hostels Generator London has lots of modern upscale fixtures a huge common area a bar and a restaurant no common kitchen though.

If the weather is nice you have to get a cocktail in The Courtyard garden – there’s a ton of graffiti art and even an installation of a giant zebra. Southwark This historic district on the south bank of the Thames has a lot going for it. Tourists flock to the neighborhood as it is home to the Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. There are several food markets but Borough Market is the best especially for foodies. You can’t miss London’s tallest most modern building the Shard. Make sure to take a walk along the river as it’s a scenic route that affords great views of the city skyline. You can cross back and forth the Thames via the Tower Millennium or London Bridges.

This is a pretty big party place with an outdoor terrace and a ton of social events to get you well acquainted with your fellow travelers like regular beer pong nights and musical performances.

Clapham For a long time Clapham was a rundown suburb of London but in recent years Clapham has turned into one of those up-and-coming districts with a constantly improving list of restaurants nightclubs music venues specialty shops and more. It’s now one of the hip places to live in the city thanks in part to the cheap rent there!

It’s a city that I’ve been to many times. Once a major city in the Roman Empire the city still places an important role in the region and is home to millions of residents and visitors enjoying all the delicious sangria and gin mouthwatering food stunning beaches warm weather the rich history and culture and unique architecture that Barcelona is famous for. Barcelona is one of the most vibrant fun energetic cities in the world. Barcelona is such a popular place that in recent years it’s even had to clamp down on overtourism” to help reduce the number of visitors. This is something I fully agree with since cities must learn to balance tourism with local life. With so much to see and do in and around Barcelona where do you begin? How many days do you need to visit? I think to really get a feel for Barcelona you should plan for four or five days. While you could see it in less you’ll do yourself a disservice if you rush your visit. This is a city of late-night dinners late morning and afternoon siestas. Life isn’t rushed here and neither should your visit. This 2-5 day itinerary highlights all the best things to see and do and help you organize your visit so you can see it all! Table of Contents Day 1 Barri Gotic Park Güell Barcelona History Museum & more! Day 2 Picasso Museum La Boquería La Rambla & more! Day 3 Montjuïc Hill Cooking Class Harbor Cable Car & more! Day 4 Day Trip to Girona Other Things to See and Do Montserrat Gaudi Bike Tour & more! Barcelona Itinerary Day 1 Take a free walking tour I love free walking tours. I think they are a wonderful way to get to know a new city find your way around and learn some history in the process. And since they are filled with traveler too they can also be a good way to meet other people. My recommended walking tour companies in Barcelona are Sandeman’s Free Walking Tours Barcelona Free Tours By Foot Get lost in the Barri Gotic Barcelona’s old Gothic Quarter is my favorite part of town filled with narrow winding streets and historic buildings. Spend a few hours getting lost in this district. To me it’s the most beautiful area in the city. The area also has numerous attractions worth seeing Barcelona History Museum – Barcelona has one of the best city history museums I’ve ever visited including 4000 square meters of Roman ruins beneath the museum that you can walk through. There is a free detailed audio guide and meticulous explanations of the exhibits. If you do one thing in the city make it this. I visit every time I’m in Barcelona. The ruins are just stunning. Admission is €7. Address Plaça del Rei. The Grand Royal Palace – The Palau Reial Major near the history museum was the home of Barcelona’s counts and later the kings of Aragon. It has a very detailed history about the city and region through the centuries. Admission is €7. Free on the first Sunday of the month and every Sunday after 3pm. Address Plaça del Rei. Chapel of Santa Àgata – This royal chapel was built in 1302. The most interesting thing inside is the beautiful altarpiece made by Jaume Huguet that was added in the 15th century. It contains beautiful paintings of religious symbols in the style of the Middle Ages. Don’t miss it! Admission is €7. Address Plaça del Rei. Barcelona Cathedral – Built in the late 13th to early 15th centuries this is a classic Gothic cathedral with huge spires colorful stained glass and incredible wood carvings. If you go inside pay the extra €3 to visit the terraces where you’ll get an incredible view of Barcelona. Admission is €7 though you can sometimes get in for free there’s no apparent schedule to this. Address Placita de la Seu 3. Explore Gaudí’s architecture Gaudí is Barcelona’s most famous and creative architect. His unique style use of nature motifs and catalog of work is legendary – and part of the reason so many people visit the city. No visit to the city is complete without a tour of Gaudí’s works. You can find them everywhere — in addition to the buildings listed below he even designed lampposts monuments and sculptures. Here are the best sights to see Park Güell – Park Güell is a 45-acre garden complex designed and built between 1900 to 1914. It’s since been converted into a municipal garden and is now a World Heritage Site. The focal point of the park is the main terrace which is surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. Known for incorporating various themes into his work Gaudí incorporated artistic elements of Catalan nationalism as well as ancient poetry and mysticism into this work. The park is right near La Sagrada Familia so it’s easy to visit both. I like how colorful everything in the park is! Tickets are €8.50 at the ticket office or €7.50 when you order in advance online. Children six years old and younger are free. Address Carrer d’Olot. La Sagrada Família – The most famous of Gaudí’s work….and one that seems to never be finished. The church has been under construction for over than 100 years the groundbreaking was in 1882 and is supposed to be done in 2030!. Gaudí was a devout Catholic and spent the last 10 years of his life working on this project. The church blends influences of man nature and religion in its detailed architecture. The audio guide is worth purchasing as it covers the history of the church in great detail. Try to visit mid-morning to late afternoon so you can witness the sunlight cascade throughout all the stained glass. Admission is €15 online/€18 at the door. Address Plaça de la Sagrada Familia. Casa Batlló – Casa Batllo is a building restored by Antoni Gaudí in the early 1900s. He spent 2 years on the project completely revamping the exterior main floor patio and roof. With its undulating shape it’s definitely one of the more eye-catching of his creations. Located in the Eixample district of Barcelona it like everything Gaudí designed was heavy influenced by the Art Nouveau style. The facade was decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles that he collected from the trash of a nearby glass shop. The roof is arched and has been likened to the back of a dragon. It’s one of my favorite Gaudí buildings. Admission is €24.50 online/€28.50 at door. Address Passeig de Gràcia 43. Casa Milà also called La Pedrera – From 1906 to 1910 Gaudi work on Casa Mila also known as La Pedrera” the stone quarry as the building has a facade of limestone. The goal was to evoke the sense of a snowy mountain. Gaudí himself a Catholic and a devotee of the Virgin Mary also planned for the Casa Milà to be a spiritual symbol and included many religious elements like an excerpt from the rosary prayer on the cornice and statues of Mary St. Michael and St. Gabriel. Casa Milà became run down and partially abandoned until it was restored in the late 1980s to its original form. Admission is €22 online/€25 at door. Address Passeig de Gràcia 92. Palau Güell – Located off La Rambla Palau Guell Guell Palace building doesn’t jump out at you like other Gaudí structures. Built from 1886-88 it was designed for one of Gaudi’s patrons Eusebi Güell. The home is centered around the main room used to entertain high-society guests. The main party room has a high ceiling with small holes near the top where lanterns were hung at night from the outside to give the appearance of a starlit sky. There are colorful tree-like chimneys on top. It’s a bit creepy and gothic to me. One of my favorites too! Admission is €12 free on the first Sunday of every month. Address Carrer Nou de la Rambla 3-5. Note Advanced reservations are recommended for Park Guell Sagrada Familia Casa Mila and Casa Batllo so you can skip the lines! Barcelona Itinerary Day 2 Visit the Picasso Museum While I’m not a huge fan of most of Picasso’s later work it’s still interesting to learn about the life and work of one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century. With more than 4000 pieces of art there certainly is a lot to see here. Admission is €11 with discounts available for students and seniors. Free Thursday evenings 6-9pm and on the first Sunday of each month. Address Carrer Montcada 15-23. Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art MACBA This museum has over 5000 works including an extensive collection of pieces by Spanish artists such as Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso. There are also works by Americans Andy Warhol and Alexander Calder who is known for his innovative mobiles. If you love modern art be sure to add this to your itinerary. Admission is €10 with discounts available. Free Saturdays 4-8pm. It’s always free for anyone under 14. Address Plaça dels Àngels 1. La Boquería This public market has an amazing array of food stalls and restaurants. It’s been at this location for hundreds of years in a building with a beautiful iron entrance. It’s right off La Rambla a long popular central thoroughfare see below so the market is typically very busy. But grab a snack or an inexpensive lunch of ham bread cheese and fruit and enjoy the scene. There’s a wide variety of seafood including fish shrimp octopus and oysters as well as nuts candy wine and tapas. NOTE Due to overcrowding tourist groups are now restricted to 15 people or less. You’ll have no problem moving about on your own but if you’re in a large group….well be prepared to get kicked out! The city is appropriately trying to take back the markets for locals. Watch for changes to how they allow tourists into the market. Take a stroll on La Rambla The popular 1.2km long boulevard with a broad but crowded walkway in the center has many beautiful buildings along it including the Gran Teatre del Liceu the city’s opera house. Near the theater you can also see a mosaic by Joan Miró. And there are street performers galore here they even have their own union. While this street is ground zero for tourists in the city don’t eat at the restaurants here they suck it’s worth a stroll down at least once. Hit the beach You’ve done a ton of walking so far so take the afternoon to relax! Barcelona has a wide and long beach Barceloneta that is incredibly popular year-round. The water is good to swim in the sand is golden colored and there are a lot of good restaurants on the boardwalk. It’s always busy with tourists and locals however so walk further from the center to reach some quieter and cleaner beaches such as Sant Sebastià in the south and Somorrostro in the north. Watch some flamenco Spend your evening watching flamenco at one of these places Los Tarantos – This is Barcelona’s oldest flamenco venue. It’s a short show just 30 minutes so it’s a good place for an introduction to the art and won’t take up your entire night. Admission from €15. Address Plaça Reial 17. Palau Dalmases – One of the best things about the flamenco shows here is the venue. This palace has amazing décor and incredible architecture. Admission is €25 with one drink included. Address Carrer de Montcada 20. Tablao Flamenco Cordobes – This show is in a convenient location on Barcelona’s main walkway but it’s pricey. Admission is €45 drink and show or €79.50 dinner and show.

Admission is €43 drink and show or €61 dinner and show. Address Av. de Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia 13. Barcelona Itinerary Day 3 Ride the harbor cable car The 1450-meter-long harbor aerial tramway with red cars connects Barceloneta and Montjuïc a prominent hill.

Barcelona Itinerary Day 4 Take a day trip to Girona This medieval city just 100km from Barcelona is one of my favorite destinations in Spain – and far too overlooked by travelers. Here you can climb atop the city walls wander the narrow lanes of the Jewish Quarter and soak up the ambiance at one of its many cafés. They filmed Game of Thrones here too! There’s a lot of history and delicious food in the city! The Renfe train ride is about 80 minutes on the normal train return tickets from €20 the high-speed train gets there in 38 minutes return tickets from €30. Other Things to See and Do in Barcelona If you have more than four days in Barcelona you’re in luck. There are plenty of other activities to fill your time Head to Montserrat – The Montserrat mountain range is just outside of the city and makes for a great getaway from Barcelona’s urban atmosphere. You can reach the area by taking a one-hour train ride. Once there pay a visit to the famous shrine of the Black Madonna at the monastery and walk around the park. The Benedictine monastery and the valley of unique rocky pillars make for some really awesome photography. Return train tickets are around €20 and you’ll also need to decide whether to take the cable car my preference or funicular up the mountain. Visit an old-school amusement park – Tibidabo Barcelona built in 1899 is one of the oldest amusement parks in the world. On a tall mountain in the Serra de Collserola it also offers an incredible view of Barcelona and the coastline. It’s open on the weekends except in the winter. Admission is €28.50 for adults €10.30 for children under 1.2m tall and free for children under 0.90m tall. Address Plaça del Tibidabo 3. Catch an outdoor film – If you’re in Barcelona in July or August consider going up to Montjuïc Castle to catch an outdoor film on the lawn of the castle’s moat. Screenings take place on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and are preceded by some cool live music. Watch a soccer match – The first football” game I ever saw was in Barcelona. It was Espanyol versus Valencia. I still have the shirt I bought that day. Barcelona’s two teams are Espanyol and FC Barcelona and if a match is going on try to take in one. Locals are obsessed with the sport and you’ll make a lot of good friends at the game! If you can’t make a game you can tour the stadium and the FCB or Barça Museum. Tour admission is €26 online/€29.50 at the door. Match tickets are from €29 depending on the opponent. Address C. d’Aristides Maillol 12. Visit the aquarium – Perfect for a rainy day the Barcelona Aquarium has more than 11000 animals showcasing species from a variety of underwater ecosystems. The walk-through tunnel is the best part. Admission €20. Address Moll d’Espanya del Port Vell. Gaze at Barcelona’s free public art – Gaudí outdid himself with the huge fountain located in the Parc de la Ciutadella a tribute to the god Neptune. I absolutely love the art and fountain here. Gaudi designed the famous Cascada Fountain when he was an architecture student. On a warm day I just like to sit and stare at the fountain. There’s also a zoo in the park and some short walking paths. Take a bottle of wine grab some ham and have a picnic. Other offbeat Gaudí works include the lampposts in Plaça Reial and Pla de Palau and the Miralles gate and wall on Passeig de Manuel Girona. Barcelona native Joan Miró’s work is found throughout the town and you can see his famous Woman and Bird” sculpture at Parc de Joan Miró. There are also Miró mosaics on La Rambla and at the airport.

Where to Eat in Barcelona For some excellent food be sure to check out some of my favorite places Les Quinze Nits – Delicious food at a great price in the famous Plaça Reial. It’s a bit touristy but even the locals come here for the value. It has a typical Spanish menu. Avoid the long lines at dinner by going for lunch instead. Address Plaça Reial 6. La Fonda – Good food with large portions near Plaça Reial. Its set menu will give you more than you can eat and it features beautiful décor and a robust wine selection. Address Escudellers 10. Pinotxo Bar – Just inside the Boquería food market this little stall is always packed and serves some of the most famous tapas in the area. I stopped there while on a food tour and it was delicious. Try the chickpea salad! Address La Boquería La Rambla 91. The Four Cats – This was one of Picasso’s favorite haunts and a popular hangout for artists in the early 1900s. Grab a drink and maybe some tapas the patatas bravas are delicious! and soak up the place’s history. Address Carrer de Montsió 3. *** Barcelona has something for everyone.

Posted Azerbaijan is one of those emerging destinations that tourists are finally starting to discover. Until 1991 it was part of the Soviet Union and ever since it became independent travelers have increasingly started to visit this lesser-known country. The number of foreign visitors has nearly tripled in the last decade to almost three million in 2018. While the sightseeing hot spots might not be well known there are plenty of things to see and do in Azerbaijan. The capital Baku has unique architecture including lots of Parisian-style buildings from the 19th century. It is also home to some very futuristic constructions funded by the country’s oil wealth such as the three Flame Towers which are covered in LED screens that display dancing flames. Outside of Baku you can see mud volcanoes visit 40000-year-old rock paintings at Gobustan or head to the hills to hike in the Caucasus Mountains. But is Azerbaijan safe? On the whole Azerbaijan is very safe. Since the country is ruled by a strongman who wants very much to increase tourism to the country crimes against visitors are virtually unheard of. Why? Because if someone is caught committing a crime against a tourist the punishments will be quite severe. Most crimes are usually small and involve taking advantage of people in crowded places where perpetrators are less likely to get caught. With that said there are a few things to remember and a couple of locations to avoid. The tips below will help make your experience in Azerbaijan safe and enjoyable. 8 Safety Tips for Azerbaijan 1. Stay aware of your belongings – Petty theft and pickpocketing are rare here as the government which is a dictatorship punishes thieves quite harshly. Nevertheless petty theft does happen from time to time in busy outdoor markets in Azerbaijan as well as on the Baku metro and other public transport. Be more aware of your belongings when you’re in crowded places and don’t flaunt anything expensive. 2. Look out for drink-related scams – There have been some reports of travelers being robbed after having their drinks spiked particularly in Western-style nightclubs and bars in Baku. Don’t take food or drink from strangers or people you’ve just met and always keep an eye on drinks you’ve ordered. There are also reports of scams targeting men at bars when women ask a foreign man to buy her drinks. She ends up leaving him with a very high bar tab and if he’s unable to pay a group of men might use physical force to insist. 3. Don’t insult the ruling Aliyev family – The president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev who took over from his father Heydar in 2003 and his family are not to be mocked or spoken about badly. He has won five elections with around 80% of the vote but there’s plenty of evidence that he and his New Azerbaijan Party are responsible for widespread corruption and a lack of democratic process along with jailing people who have criticized the family or the government. Play it safe and avoid talking politics while you’re here. 4. Don’t go near or talk about Armenia – Avoid the border of Armenia and Azerbaijan where sporadic armed clashes still take place. In particular don’t go near the Nagorno-Karabakh region which is a disputed area where armed conflict is common. There are land mines in these regions as well another good reason to steer clear. The safest thing is simply not to mention Armenia at all. There’s an ongoing bitter conflict between the two nations and Azerbaijanis can get angry if you try to talk about Armenia. If you’re of Armenian descent — for example if you have an Armenian surname — this might cause problems for you in Azerbaijan so be prepared. 5. Be careful on the roads – Many of the roads in Azerbaijan are in poor condition and drivers often speed. You also need to watch out for people on foot and livestock in rural Azerbaijan. If you can avoid it don’t drive at night — there is usually little or no lighting on the roads and there are a lot of potholes and bumps that can cause a bad accident if you can’t see them coming. On the plus side the blood alcohol limit here is zero so there is no tolerance for drinking and driving which means you’re less likely to encounter drunk drivers here. If driving make sure you follow this law to the letter. Road safety is likely going to be your biggest concern here so always be extra careful when driving or near busy roads. 6. Refuse to pay bribes – There’s quite a culture of bribery and corruption in Azerbaijan so you might find yourself in a situation where you’re asked to pay a bribe. Although it can feel difficult it’s OK to refuse to pay and usually that will be the end of it. Many Azerbaijanis are embarrassed by the extent of corruption and bribery and will do their best to hide it from foreign tourists. Unfortunately there is a minority who will still demand bribes — sometimes even officials. 7. Look out for fake police – It’s quite a common scam to come across criminals dressed as police officers. In their disguise they will target foreigners and try to issue you a fake traffic infringement or demand you pay a fine for photographing in the street. If in doubt ask them to take you to a police station. Hopefully they will then agree to leave you alone. 8. Buy travel insurance – Every time you travel you should make sure you have an appropriate level of travel insurance. You never know what might go wrong! Hopefully nothing will happen to you while you’re exploring Azerbaijan but you’ll be really grateful you have travel insurance if you are involved in a car accident become the victim of theft or get sick and find yourself in an emergency situation. We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70.

The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance FAQ on Azerbaijan Safety To help you plan your trip here are answers to the most frequently asked questions we get about safety in Azerbaijan How safe is Baku for tourists? Thanks to income from oil and gas Baku is a modern capital city with decent public transport and is generally safe. There are some risks of petty theft in crowds or bars and tourists can be a target of drink spiking and other scams see above in Western-style bars and nightclubs. Be extra vigilant on a night out. Maybe the most dangerous part of being in Baku is the traffic. Many Azerbaijanis drive very fast and without much regard for the rules of the road. If you’re a pedestrian be wary of vehicles when you’re near a road and especially when you’re crossing. When in doubt follow the lead of the locals. Is it safe to drive in Azerbaijan? Driving in Baku can be challenging quite a lot of traffic fast drivers and pedestrians who don’t pay much attention. However it’s probably more dangerous to drive in rural areas both because of the poor driving standards and the low quality of the highways. The road conditions are particularly bad outside the cities and driving at night is especially dangerous as the roads are poorly lit or not lit at all. Is Azerbaijan safe for women traveling alone? In general Azerbaijan is safe for all people traveling solo but some women have reported incidents of unwanted male attention while walking alone and taking taxis. If going out at night make sure you have someone to accompany you just to be safe. Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel Women Shouldn’t Be Afraid to Travel Alone Is the drinking water safe in Azerbaijan? The tap water in Azerbaijan should be boiled before drinking to make sure that it is free of contaminants. Boil the water for at least 1 minute to make sure it’s clean. While you can also buy bottled water here I’d just bringing a reusable water bottle and a Lifestraw or SteriPen. They can purify your water while also reducing your environmental impact. *** From the contrasts of 19th-century architecture with the envelope-pushing modern buildings of Baku to the scenic vistas of the sparsely-populated towns and villages you’ll find plenty of things to see and do in Azerbaijan. Just be sure to use common sense by avoiding talking about sensitive topics such as the war with Armenia when you are talking to locals. Be aware of the potential for petty theft and scams keep an eye out and your valuables out of sight. Do that and you’ll be just fine. On the whole Azerbaijan is safe to visit and tourism numbers are growing for a good reason. Spend some time seeing Azerbaijan now while it’s still not crowded with tourists — you won’t regret it! Book Your Trip to Azerbaijan Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay elsewhere use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. I use them all the time. My favorite places to stay in Azerbaijan are Sahil Hostel Baku – This hostel is clean spacious and well maintained. It won Hostelworld’s 2019 award for best hostel in the city. Old Ganja Hostel Ganja – While thos hostel itself is rather no frills the staff here are incredible and go above and beyond to ensure you have a great time in Ganja. Lahij Guesthouse Lahij – With free Wi-Fi great views and a charming and rustic interior this hoestl is a good choice for anyone looking for a more unique stay in Lahij. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong.

Reply Renuka Walter October 24 2019 at 830 am No mention of Armenia! Sounds quite scary…! Would love to visit Azerbaijan. Sounds like an interesting destination. Reply Nihad S March 3 2020 at 339 am I totally disagree with the 7.th. I live in Azerbaijan for 23 years and I never heard anything like that or even similar to that. Wearing like a policeman is crime and nobody would like to risk it. Nothing happened like that before. Also about the roads. Most of the roads in the central areas are new and flat. Of course there are some roads that are a little bit old but mostly they are either out of the city or inside the neighborhood. About safety I can say that Azerbaijan is so safe country to travel. I’ve traveled almost all of the european countries and I can say that they are more dangerous than Azerbaijan. Also wherever you go Azerbaijani people will welcome you really warm and try to do their best in order to host you in their country 🙂 Reply Leave a Comment Cancel reply By posting a comment you agree to our community friendly anti-spam comment policy that can be found here.

As gringo central” for Colombia you can’t walk five feet without coming across one with majority located in El Pablado Gringoland and Laureles up-and-coming Gringoland. In fact if you look on Hostelworld you’ll find 93 hostels in this city. That’s a lot of hostels. I spent close to three weeks in Medellín first for an extended time over the holidays and then again as I made my way from north to south. Like I do whenever I’m in cities that long I decided to stay in as many hostels as possible to find out which were the best. A lot of online lists purport to tell you the best hostels in the city but I found that my experiences staying in them differed so greatly from the reviews I began to think Ya know I don’t think people really stayed here!” And there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Medellín are Location – Medellín is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Medellín you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

Los Patios This stylish hostel has themed floors inspired by Colombia’s natural surroundings mountains jungles sea and plains. It’s part of a massive two-building complex that also has a co-working space a gym rooftop bars an organic garden whose herbs you can use a Spanish school and communal kitchens. It was by far my favorite hostel in the entirety of the city. In fact I think it is one of the best hostels I’ve ever stayed in! Each dorm bed comes with a privacy curtain and the private rooms are as comfortable as hotels. The bathrooms were amazing and the beds super comfy — I got some of my best nights’ sleep here.

Hostel Rango Boutique Hostel Rango is one of the more upscale hostels in the city. The dorm beds are super comfy though the beds lack privacy curtains. Each bed comes with reading lights two power sockets and personal lockers. The bathrooms are nicer than anything I’ve ever seen in a hostel and rival that of a luxury hotel. I mean that water pressure! That rustic design? So good! I want these bathrooms in my home. Private rooms are also available and come with a few additional touches like TVs and mini-fridges but they are as expensive as hotels so skip them. I found the open industrial décor is super fashionable and the hostel’s restaurant and bar area great for grabbing a meal and a really good professional cocktail honestly the bar alone is worth visiting. The staff will also help to set you up with activities like food tours and free walking tours. Hostel Rango Boutique at a Glance $$ Restaurant/bar on-site makes it eays to meet people Organizes tours and activities Comfy dorm beds with lots of outlets Beds from $18 USD privates from $75 USD. —-> Click here to book your stay at Hostel Rango Boutique! 3. Sugar Cane Hostel German- and Colombian-owned Sugar Cane is small. There are just a few private and dorm rooms on one level. The rooms are impressively clean although they lack the character of the larger hostels in town. The roof has a common area with a few hammocks as well as the hostel’s kitchen. Breakfast is free you serve yourself and comes with all the essentials like bread eggs muesli coffee and tea. Every Sunday the German owner I forget his name cooks up his famous barbecue of chicken steak sausages and all the fixings! It’s a pretty standard simple hostel but the owner really makes you feel like family and he helped me a lot during my stay. Sugar Cane Hostel at a Glance $ Laid-back lounge with hammocks on the roof Free breakfast Weekly BBQ makes it easy to meet people Beds from $10 USD private rooms from $28 USD. —-> Click here to book your stay at Sugar Cane Hostel! 4. Happy Buddha Boutique Hostel This is the largest party hostel in Medellín so if you’re looking to get crazy this your best bet! The staff works hard to keep people happy and drunk including organizing drinking games salsa classes and pub crawls. You’ll get free breakfast and coffee in the mornings. The drink are cheap here and there are two on-site restaurants selling sushi and tacos. Thankfully the huge bar area is separate from the rooms so it’s pretty quiet. But the rooms are fairly basic and the beds nothing special — you’ll sleep but won’t be blown away by anything. The real reason to come here is to be in the middle of the party! A lot of pub crawls stop here. Happy Buddha Boutique Hostel at a Glance $ Lively party vibe makes it easy to meet people Organizes tons of activities Free breakfast and cheap drinks Beds from $10 USD private rooms from $28 USD. —-> Click here to book your stay at Happy Buddha Boutique Hostel! 5. The Wandering Paisa The Wandering Paisa is located in the upscale area of Laureles which is the up and coming touristy area. All the dorms are covered in South American and Colombian cultural artwork by local students. Each bed comes with a large locker and a privacy divider which makes it easier to sleep. While the beds are average I was a big fan of the nice pillows. The kitchen is has the basic essentials. The Paisa Bar is a fun spot to hang out in and local musicians perform on the sundeck. The hostel also offers free salsa lessons and Spanish classes. If you want to get out of Poblado this is the place to stay.

Black Sheep Hostel The Black Sheep Hostel one of Medellín’s most popular was also the first in town. I really loved this hostel. The rooms while pretty bare are spotless and the bathrooms have great water pressure and are cleaned regularly. There are lots of common spaces here including a large balcony and terrace area. The beer sold is cheap and I found guests here were always socializing and hanging out the way they should. The Kiwi staff owner is super nice and staff members are all university students that are great at handing out local advice. The hostel also offers a ton of tour options that you can book directly from and they’ll even exchange money if you need. This is another classic” hostel that gets everything right! I loved it.

Purple Monkey This is definitely one of the liveliest party hostels in Medellín. It’s quirky and upbeat with a massive rooftop bar area. I found the dorms to be small and cramped and it was a bit weird to go upstairs and outside to the shower area but the place is kept very clean there’s free breakfast and you really only come here to party so who cares about anything else! Purple Monkey at a Glance $ Massive rooftop bar makes it easy to meet people Free breakfast Super social atmosphere Beds from $11 USD. —-> Click here to book your stay at Purple Monkey! 8. Casa Kiwi Hostel Casa Kiwi Hostel is another institution and located in the middle of Poblado. The dorms are small and I found the beds to be a little thin but each bed has a locker and overall the building is clean and tidy. There’s a big kitchen with free coffee and tea but the hostel’s restaurant serves up tasty and cheap food. It also has a rooftop terrace a plunge pool a bar plenty of hammocks and a mini-theater. As one of the most popular hostels in the city it’s really easy to meet people here as it’s always full! Casa Kiwi Hostel at a Glance $ Restaurant on-site makes it easy to mingle Rooptop terrace and pool Great place to meet people Beds from $11 USD private rooms from $31 USD. —-> Click here to book your stay at Casa Kiwi Hostel! *** Two places I would not recommend staying are Monet’s and Selina. Monet’s is new and cheap and has friendly owners but it’s far from the action the walls are thin and the accommodations pretty basic. If you were on a tight tight budget and everywhere else was full it would be good for a night. I wouldn’t spend more time there than that. Selina is a super popular hostel with digital nomads and has locations around the world. It’s always so hyped up that I was pretty excited to stay there. However I was greatly disappointed with it. It was good spot to work from they have a co-working space there are resturants on site and the bar though overpriced was nice place to meet expats and travelers but the beds were hard the rooms had little privacy and the bathrooms weren’t well kept. Given the high premium it charges I just didn’t see the value in staying there. Better to stay elsewhere and go party at Selina instead! You get more bang for your peso elsewhere. *** So there you have it the best hostels in Medellín based on my recent firsthand experience. You can’t go wrong with any of them but by far the best best BEST hostel in the city is Los Patios. It’s one of the greatest hostels I’ve ever stayed in! Did we miss any?

Black sheep is popular but I’m not sure why. The rooms are really dated and smell bad. Kinda far from everything but the metro. Social but so are most social hostels”. Los Patios was really nice and centrally located like Purple Monkey. Social atmosphere could be a hit or a miss because of all the different levels. Selina is good for big groups aka large Israeli groups. As with most Selina’s I found that it looked nice on the outside but lacked general upkeep. The beds were flimsy and it was just too big of a hostel for my liking. I really liked the Colombian staff members when I was there. They were awesome and helped me practice my Spanish but then again I could say that about most Colombians.

Growing up Budapest seemed like this historic yet mysterious place closed off by the Soviets but filled with historic grandeur. When I first visited the gritty rundown streets charmed me. Budapest felt edgy in sharp contrast to say Prague’s more sanitized history. IT was a city of underground bars in abandoned buildings hearty food and serious people. Over the years I’ve seen the city change as the tourists visit in droves. And while no longer as edgy those ruin bars are no longer hidden Budapest is still something else. It offers some of the best nightlife in Europe tons of spas and hot springs stunning historic buildings and museums and lots of green space. Budapest is a city with layers. No matter what you’re interested in you’ll be able to find it here. To help you make the most out of your next trip here are my top 24 things to see and do in Budapest. 1. Take a Free Walking Tour Whenever I arrive in a new destination I always take a free walking tour. It’s a budget-friendly way to see the main sights learn about the destination and ask any questions you have to a local expert. They’re a quick and easy way to get an overview of a city which will help you plan the rest of your trip. Budapest has a number of good free tours available. Here are a few you can check out to get started Strawberry Tours Trip to Budapest Generation Tours 2. Soak at the Baths Budapest is known for its thermal spa baths it’s one of the best things about this city. You’ll find more than 100 mineral hot springs here many dating back to the Roman Empire. The most popular is the Széchenyi Baths in City Park. With 18 pools it’s the largest and most famous in Europe. The historic buildings that house the spa were built in 1913 and it’s a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. Don’t forget your bathing suit and flip-flops you can rent towels and lockers. Állatkerti krt. 9-11 +36 1-363-3210 www.szechenyifurdo.hu. Open daily 6am-10pm. Admission starts at 4900 HUF. 3. Ruin Bars The nightlife in Budapest is one of the best in Europe — and ruin bars are a big reason why. Located in the old Jewish Quarter much of the neighborhood was left to decay after World War II. During the 90s bars began to appear in the abandoned buildings in the area. Now this underground scene is well on the map. But that doesn’t make this eclectic arty and funky spaces any less fun. Szimpla Kert Instant and Fogasház are my three favorites but for a more detailed list of what’s hot right now check out my post on the best ruin bars in Budapest! 4. Castle Hill This historic area is home to baroque houses and Habsburg monuments. Cobblestone streets and narrow alleys that hark back to the city’s medieval roots parallel panoramic views of Pest and the Danube. This section of the city is actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site with the Old Town in the north and the massive palace to the south which dates to the 13th century. 6. Buda Castle In the Castle Hill area you’ll also find Buda Castle it’s more of a palace complex than anything else. The original complex was constructed in the 13th century however the huge Baroque palace that exists today was actually built between 1749-1769. Originally intended for the nobility the palace was looted by the Nazis and then the Soviets during World War II. Fun fact Beneath the castle Vlad the Impaler colloquially known as Count Dracula was imprisoned for 14 years. In the dungeon area there is also a labyrinth that tourists used to be able to explore — in the dark no less — though it’s now closed. You’ll also find some museums here as well see below. Szent György tér 2 +36 1 458 3000 budacastlebudapest.com. The courtyards are open 24/7 while the castle is open daily from 10am-8pm. 5. Hospital in the Rock This museum served as a hospital bomb shelter prison and nuclear bunker. Here you’ll learn about the impacts that World War II the 1956 revolution and the Cold War had on the city and its people. Opened in 2008 it’s one of the most popular attractions in town. Admission includes a one-hour guided tour of the museums which has all sorts of wax figures tools equipment and furnishings. Lovas ut 4/c  +36 70 701 0101 sziklakorhaz.eu/en. Open daily 10am-8pm. Admission is 4000 HUF. 6. Hungarian National Gallery Opened in 1957 this museum focuses on Hungarian artists and history of which I knew very little before my first visit. The gallery is located in Buda Castle home to paintings and sculptures from the renaissance and middle ages including wooden altarpieces from the 1400s. You can also tour the building’s massive dome. The gallery hosts rotating temporary exhibits too so check the website to find out what’s on during your visit. 1014 Budapest +36 20 439 7325 mng.hu. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am-6pm last tickets sold at 5pm. Admission is 1800 HUF and audio guides are available for 800 HUF. 7. Budapest History Museum This museum covers four floors of Buda Castle and provides a comprehensive overview of the city’s entire history. It’s a must for anyone looking to get a more detailed look at the city’s 2000-year past. My favorite exhibit was the 1000 Years of Budapest” display. Be sure to get the audio guide as it provides a lot of good supplemental information. It’s worth the cost. +36 1 487 8800  budacastlebudapest.com/budapest-history-museum. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am-4pm 6pm in the summer. Admission varies by season 2000-2400 HUF. An audio guide is available for 1200 HUF. Admission is free on national holidays. 8. The Cave Church In the 1920s Catholic monks built this church in a large cave system that had been previously used by a hermit monk. Known as Saint Ivan’s Cave the cave was used as a hospital during World War II. When the communists came to power after the war they covered the entrance in concrete and executed the head monk. In 1989 as the Iron Curtain fell the church was reopened and is now a popular place for tourists as well as a place of worship for locals. Get the audio guide to make the most out of your visit. There is a lot of history here. Sziklatemlom út Gellért Hill sziklatemplom.hu/web/fooldal.html. Open Monday-Saturday 930am-730pm. Admission is 600 HUF. 9. Matthias Church This neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church is one of the most unique churches in Europe. I’ve literally seen hundreds of churches and cathedrals across the continent and this is one of the most original. The original church in this spot was built in the 11th century though nothing remains of it the current building was constructed in the 14th century and was heavily renovated in the 19th century. During the Turkish invasion of the 16th century it was converted to a mosque which is why its vibrant colors and designs that aren’t common in European churches the church has a colorful roof that almost makes it look like it was built from Lego. Once inside you’ll see the huge vaulted ceilings and ornate décor. Szentháromság tér 2 +36 1 355 5657 matyas-templom.hu. Open 9am-5pm on weekdays 9am-1pm on Saturdays and 1pm-5pm on Sundays. Admission is 1800 HUF. Guided tours are available for 2500 HUF. 10. Fisherman’s Bastion Built between 1895 and 1902 this terrace is comprised of seven towers that look out over the river. Each one is meant to represent one of the seven Hungarian tribes that founded the city. The terrace was designed by the same architect who created the Matthias Church and provides stunning panoramic views across the Danube River. Competing legends say that the name comes from either the fact that the terrace overlooks the old fishermen’s guild or that the fishermen’s guild was responsible for protecting that area of the wall. No one is quite certain which is right. Szentháromság tér +36 1 458 3030 fishermansbastion.com. Open daily 9am-11pm. Admission is free with an additional charge of 1000 HUF to visit the upper turrets. 11. Hungarian Presidential Palace The Hungarian Presidental Palace has been the workplace of the president since 2003. Known as Sándor-palota Alexander Palace it’s not nearly as impressive as the surrounding buildings but if you time your visit right you can see the changing of the guard ceremony at the top of each hour from 9am-5pm excluding Sundays. Sometimes the palace will be open for tours but this rarely happens so don’t get your hopes up. Szent György tér 1-2 +36 1 224 5000. Admission to the changing of the guard is free. 12. Buda Tower This reconstructed tower” is all that remains of the Church of Mary Magdalene which was originally built in the 13th century but was destroyed during World War II. When the Turks occupied the city between 1541-1699 the church was converted into a mosque. It reopened in 2017 and you can now climb the 172 steps that lead to the top. That said the views from Castle Hill are just as good — and free — so I’d skip climbing the steps and just admire this historic tower from the outside. Kapisztrán tér 6 budatower.hu/en. Open daily 10am-6pm but only on the weekends in January and February. Admission is 1500 HUF. 13. Walk Across the Chain Bridge The Széchenyi Chain Bridge connects Buda with Pest and is a wrought-iron and stone suspension bridge. The bridge originally opened in 1849 but was damaged during World War II and had to be rebuilt. Spend some time strolling across the bridge and taking in the view. Don’t miss Gresham Palace located on the Pest side. It’s an Art Nouveau building that is now a luxurious Four Seasons hotel. 14. Visit Parliament Built in 1902 this is the largest building in the country and home to the national assembly. This massive structure — which covers over 18000 square meters — took almost 20 years to build. You can take guided tours of the building where you can learn about the history of the city and how the government of the country works. If you plan to visit purchase your tickets in advance as the lines can get quite long. Kossuth Lajos tér 1-3 +36 1 441 4000 parlament.hu. Open daily 8am-6pm. Admission is 6000 HUF. 15. Stroll Along the Danube After visiting Parliament take a walk along the river. Head south to check out the promenade and its many green spaces and sculptures including the sobering Shoes on the Danube Bank” a memorial honoring the Jews who were shot here during World War II. If you have a book or just want to take in the view this is a reflective place to stop and relax. 16. Great Market Hall This is the oldest and largest indoor market in the country.

But that doesn’t mean a trip there has to break the bank. There are plenty of ways to save money during your visit to Iceland including during your stay in the cozy capital city of Reykjavik. Home to just 125000 people Reykjavik is a small city that is bustling with life and activities all year round. It’s artsy cute fun and just filled with an awesome energy! Whether you’re visiting Reykjavik on a weekend city break or planning to head out and explore the entire country there are plenty of ways to save money during your stint in the city! To help you do that here are my favorite free or cheap things to do in and around Iceland’s awesome capital Free Things to Do in Reykjavik 1. Take a Free Walking Tour One of the best ways to start a trip to a new city is to take a walking tour. You’ll get to see the main sights learn some history and acclimatize to the culture. Plus you have a local expert who you can ask questions to which is an invaluable resource in and of itself! The two companies I recommend are The City Walk and Free Walking Tours Reykjavik. You can’t go wrong with either. Remember to tip your guide! 2. Enjoy the Local Entertainment Since the harsh climate forces many Icelanders to be indoors much of the year they’ve developed a creative and artistic culture. There are lots of Icelandic painters poets writers and musicians. You can usually catch a free live show in Reykjavík at Café Rosenberg sometimes there’s a cover charge at the door Hlemmur Square Hostel usually on Wednesday nights KEX Hostel HI Loft Hostel and the Drunk Rabbit Irish Pub which usually has someone who sings solo with his guitar. 3. Find Free Hot Springs While the Blue Lagoon may be the most popular hot spring in the area there are tons of others around the country that are free or at the very least less money than the Blue Lagoon. Visit the website Hotpot Iceland to find the best hot springs near the city. One nearby hot spring worth visiting is in Reykjadalur. It’s around a 40-minute drive from town and involves a bit of a hike to get there about 30 minutes but it’s much more secluded – and much less expensive – than the Blue Lagoon! 4. Hang out with the Locals Iceland has a very active Couchsurfing community. I’ve stayed with hosts in Reykjavík as well as in Akureyri Iceland’s main northern city. While many hosts are expats living in Iceland it’s still a great way to save some money and get helpful local insights! Additionally if you don’t want to stay with a stranger there are usually weekly meet-ups you can attend! Make some friends! 5. Hit the Beach Nauthólsvík is a man-made beach that not only has hot tubs but also a heated swimming area! It’s popular with locals and gets quite busy in the summer so make sure to come early to get a good spot. There is also a non-heated swimming area so if you’re feeling brave you can test the waters spoiler it’s cold. 6. Hike Mount Esja If you’re looking to stretch your legs head up Esja. The summit sits around 900m above sea level offering you some amazing views of the city and surrounding area. Located just 10km from the city the hike will take a couple of hours but the views are definitely worth it! Just make sure you check the weather as it’s unwise to hike during rain or snow. 7. Visit the Harpa Music Hall & Conference Center Opened in 2011 this cultural and social center is worth checking out just to see the architecture for yourself. You can also catch the Iceland Symphony Orchestra Reykjavik Big Band and the Icelandic Opera here. The venue also hosts tons of other shows and performances as well so check their website for an up-to-date schedule performances will have a fee. Austurbakki 2 +354 528 5000 en.harpa.is. See the website for perforamnce dates and times. 8. See Reykjavík’s Botanical Gardens The city operates this beautifully-designed botanical garden that is home to over 5000 plant species. You’ll also see ponds birdlife and beautiful flora dotting the small garden. There’s also a café nearby that’s open in the summer that features dishes made with herbs and spices grown on-site in the garden. Laugardalur 104 Reykjavík +354 411 8650 grasagardur.is. Open daily from 10am-3pm 10pm in the summer. 9. Visit the Grótta Lighthouse This lighthouse sits at the edge of the city and is a wonderful place to bird watch and gaze out at the stretching Atlantic ocean. It ’s a long walk along the coast from the city center but the scenic view and gorgeous coastal walk are definitely worth it. If you’re visiting in the winter months this is also a great place to see the northern lights! 10. Walk or Bike the Coast Reykjavík is a small city and its coastline is walkable or bikeable if you want to rent one. Some great stops along the way are the Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach and the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula. If you’re not interested in biking around by yourself feel free to take a bike tour instead. Iceland Bike is the best bike tour company for this! 11. Visit Perlan This is a dome-shaped building called The Pearl” and it offers another great place to get a view of the city and surrounding area! On clear days you can see as far as Snæfellsjökull the 700000-year-old glacier-capped volcano that sits on the western coast of the island. Inside the dome there is a cocktail bar and restaurant so it makes for a nice place to go out and enjoy the view. 12. See the Sun Voyager This iconic statue sits known as Sólfar in Icelandic was built in 1990 by Icelandic sculptor Jón Gunnar Árnason. It’s his interpretation of discovery using the design of a traditional Viking ship to represent the promise of discovering new territory and the freedom that comes with traveling to new worlds. 13. Experience the Northern Lights If you’re visiting Reykjavik between October and March you’ll have a good chance of seeing the Aurora on a clear night. You’ll want to get away from the city a bit to have the best view as the light pollution will make it hard to see. Cheap Things to Do in Reykjavik 14. Take in the View from Hallgrímskirkja This church is one of the most memorable that I’ve seen. The stark concrete façade was designed to mimic the Icelandic landscape which I think it does quite well. It was named after the 17th-century clergyman and Icelandic poet Hallgrímur Pétursson who wrote the Hymns of the Passion. It’s the tallest building in Reykjavík and for a small fee you can go up to the top to get incredible shots of the city and its multicolored rooftops.

Entrance into the church is free but entry to the tower is 1000 ISK for adults and 100 ISK for kids. The tower is closed on Sundays during mass. 15. Visit the Reykjavík Punk Museum This museum is housed in an old underground public bathroom seriously and is dedicated to the punk and new wave scene that started took root here in the late 70’s. The museum highlights how many of Icelandic’s famous musical performers like Björk can be traced back to their punk roots. It’s definitely worth a visit. Bankastræti 2 101 Reykjavík +354 568 2003 thepunkmuseum.is. Open Monday to Friday from 10am-10pm and weekends from 12pm-10p. Admission is 1000 ISK for adults and free for kids 15 and under. 16.

The museum is focused on Icelandic artwork from the 19th and 20th century and highlights the diverse nature of the art scene in Iceland. While it is mostly local artists some foreign works are showcased here as well. Fríkirkjuvegur 7 101 Reykjavík +354 515 9600 listasafn.is.

Buy one ticket for 1500 ISK valid for three museums The National Gallery of Iceland the Sigurjón Ólafsson Museum and the Ásgrímur JónssonCollection. 17. The Icelandic Phallological Museum This is one of the weirdest museums you’ll ever have a chance to go to – which s partly why you should go! Entirely not sexual the museum has collected penises from varies species roaming the earth land and sea. The founder an Icelandic historian named Sigurdur Hjartarson started the penis museum as a joke but it’s become something much more. The whole museum is pretty small so you won’t need more than 30-60 minutes but it’s pretty interesting and informative you’ll actually learn a lot about how species procreate in addition to seeing a lot of…well exhibits. Laugavegur 116 105 Reykjavík +354 561 6663 phallus.is. Open daily from 10am-6pm. Admission is 1500 ISK for adults 1000 ISK for seniors and persons with disabilities and free for kids 13 and under. 18. Head to Videy Island This is a small island located just off of Reykjavík. It’s a great little island for a picnic or a stroll if you’re looking for something a bit off the usual tourist trail. The island is most famous for the Imagine Peace Tower envisioned and built by Yoko Ono. On each 9th of October Yoko Ono comes to light the tower on the birthday of John Lennon and it is lit until December 8th the day John was killed. The ferry is operated by daily in the summer and on the weekends in the winter. Skarfabakki Pier and Ægisgardur Harbor +354 519 5000 elding.is/videy-ferry-skarfabakki.

The high-action wax sculpted scenes are an interesting way to learn about Viking times when life was hard and dependent on the harsh elements and people were poor. It’s a good family activity.

While this isn’t my favorite hot dog place in the country it does make for a fun and iconic stop and the dogs are still pretty great!. Tryggvatagata 1 101 Reykjavík +354 511 1566 bbp.is. See the website for other locations as well as up-to-date hours of operation. 22. Relax at a Cozy Cafe One of my favorite things to do when I visit somewhere is to sit back relax and people watch.

Definitely cheap from what I remember. Could be on the list. Loved the public swimming pool as well. Spent hours people watching water sliding and jumping from hot tub to hot tub. Authentic cultural experience right there. Good call. Thanks for the write-up! Can’t wait to go back some day although I think it will be much different than it was four years ago.

It’s filled with delicious food there’s lots of amazing sushi here spacious parks don’t miss Stanley Park and is close to both the mountains and the ocean. The city consistently ranks in the top five best places to live in the world — and it’s no surprise why. It’s a wonderful wonderful city that I’ve loved ever since I first visited in 2004 with my family. Since then I’ve come back a handful of times to explore it on my own. I’ve seen the city change a lot of the last fifteen years — and one of the things that has changed for the benefit of us travelers is that there are a lot more hostels. Vancouver now has one of the best hostel scenes in Canada and you won’t be disappointed with what you find here. That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Vancouver are Location – Vancouver is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Vancouver you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Vancouver that I like the most. If you don’t want to read the longer list below the following hostels are the best in each category Best Hostel for Budget Travelers Vancouver Backpacker House Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers HI Vancouver Downtown Best Hostel for Families HI Vancouver Central Best Hostel for Partying Cambie Hostel Gastown or Cambie Hostel Seymour Best Hostel for Digital Nomads HI Vancouver Downtown Best Overall Hostel Samesun Vancouver Want the specifics of each hostel? Here’s my comprehensive list of the best hostels in Vancouver Price Legend per night $ = Under $25 USD $$ = $25-30 USD $$$ = Over $30 USD 1. Cambie Hostel Seymour Cambie Hostel Seymour is located in Gastown a hip area of Vancouver loaded with bars and restaurants. This hostel is pretty basic and small dorms are two or four beds and the hostel itself doesn’t have much ambience expect bare rooms and bathrooms in need of a refresh. But guests don’t stay here because of the property they stay because of its prime location and easy access to other destinations in the city and to the airport. But there is a common area and a chill room” which comes complete with its very own hostel cat. If you’re cooking the kitchen isn’t huge and seating is limited but the hostel also makes it easy to go out and dine. They offer $5 off breakfast at the popular Cambie Bar a part of the Gastown sister hostel a quick walk down the road see below. Below the hostel is the popular Malone’s Social Lounge & Tap the reason for the late-night noise and Chihuahuas Mexican Grill so you can eat and drink without going far. Because of its proximity to the bars it gets loud at night. If you want a lively hostel stay here. Cambie Hostel Seymour at a Glance $$ Bar below the hostel with discounts Lively social atmosphere makes it easy to meet people Laid-back common areas for hanging out and relaxing Beds from $25 USD privates from $55 USD for the night —> Book your stay at Cambie Hostel Seymour! 2. Cambie Hostel Gastown This Gastown hostel offers comfortable beds a small common room to meet and mingle in and access to Gastown’s restaurants and bars. This includes The Cambie the hostel’s bar which draws in crowds of locals. It can get incredibly loud so bring some noise-cancelling headphones because basic earplugs won’t cut it. Like its sister hostel a few blocks away there’s also housecat to keep you company if you’re allergic to cars bring allergy meds. Housed in a building dating back to the late 1800s it’s in need of a little renovation. The hostel has a small kitchen and the showers are close to the toilets which makes it cramped. Its location is its main selling point though so if you’re not expecting anything special other than direct access to Gastown and all it has to offer this is a good place for you. Cambie Hostel Gastown at a Glance $ Great place to meet other travelers Central location right downtown Bar on-site for hanging out and mingling Beds from $23 USD rooms from $53 USD a night —> Book your stay at Cambie Hostel Gastown! 3. HI Vancouver Central Like many of the other hostels in town HI Vancouver Central is an old building which means the property could use a little love. Fortunately the rooms here offer comfortable beds and every room has a ensuite bathroom. Choose from two-bed or four-bed dorms or private four-bed rooms. Located on Granville Street it’s in the heart of the action with many pubs and clubs around making it noisy at night but lively and fun too. The hostel has a free breakfast serving bagels and other baked goods as well as some fruit and cereal. It has a small common room and basic kitchen with only a toaster microwave and kettle. HI also offers tours daily to destinations around town as well as a pub crawl. HI Vancouver Central at a Glance $$ Organizes lots of activities walking tours pub crawls Large private rooms great for families Free breakfast Beds from $29 USD a night rooms from $52 USD a night —> Book your stay at HI Vancouver Central! 4. HI Vancouver Downtown Tucked into a quieter part of the city HI Vancouver Downtown is a good spot for heading out to explore popular Granville and Davie Streets which offer plenty of cafés restaurants and shopping. It’s also a quick walk to the beach and ferries to Granville Island where you’ll find lots of shopping as well as walking distance to the beautiful Stanley Park. The hostel itself isn’t all that impressive the dorms don’t have enough outlets to accommodate every bed the bathrooms are old and can be a bit musty and the Wi-Fi doesn’t work very well. But the hostel does have a free continental breakfast a game room with foosball and pool a library and a TV room. It also runs tours and has bike rentals so you can easily explore more of the city. HI Vancouver Downtown at a Glance $$ Lots of common areas so it’s easy to meet people Free breakfast Organizes lots of activities Beds from $29 USD rooms from $71 USD a night —> Book your stay at HI Vancouver Downtown! 5. Samesun Vancouver The Samesun chain of hostels consistently rank as some of the best in the cities where they are located. Samesun Vancouver is no exception. My favorite feature of this hostel is in the six-bed dorms which offer cozy pod beds and give you a bit more privacy than normal bunks as well as your own light shelf and outlets. The bathrooms are clean and there are plenty of them so you’re not left waiting in line. There’s a lot to love at this hostel. It’s has a decent free breakfast including eggs and hot cereal a full kitchen common areas for meeting people and relaxing daily hikes and even the Beaver Bar a lounge serving food and beer with a daily happy hour. The only real downsides of Samesun are the small rooms it’s hard to maneuver in the four-bed dorm the lack of elevators so you’ve got to haul your belongings up flights of stairs and Wi-Fi that doesn’t work well if at all. Its location is excellent however it’s in the Granville district which is loaded with bars and restaurants and near historic Gastown. Like most other hostels in the city it’s located in an area where the bars are open late so if you’re sensitive to noise bring earplugs. Samesun Vancouver at a Glance $$ Bar on-site for hanging out and meeting people Convenient location in Granville lots of bars and restaurants nearby Free breakfast Beds from $27 USD rooms from $75 USD a night —> Book your stay at Samesun Vancouver! 6. Vancouver Backpacker House The Vancouver Backpacker House is about as barebones as it can get — it has only a self-check-in so you have to contact the staff in advance it does not accept credit cards without a huge fee the rooms don’t have enough lockers and its location is not in the city proper. It also has some interesting house rules like not all of the bathrooms are open to use all of the time. The 10-bed dorm room is in the basement and oddly the private rooms have interior windows. Depending on the room you book you may have to walk to another building once you’ve checked in. But if you’re on a tight budget and the other hostels are packed this place works. It’s near public transit that takes you into the city in about 15 minutes. Vancouver Backpacker House at a Glance $ Super affordable accommodation Laid back atmosphere Beds from $22 USD rooms from $41 USD a night —> Book your stay at Vancouver Backpacker House! *** While the hostel scene in Vancouver may not be as extensive as other parts of the world you’ll still find lots of suitable options here. In an expensive city like Vancouver hostels are your best option if you’re on a budget — especially if you’re looking to enjoy the city’s rambunctious nightlife. Just make sure you have some good earplugs or noise-canceling headphones if you’re a light sleeper. This is a lively city after all! Book Your Trip to Vancouver Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

There are plenty of electrical outlets one at every bed and the lockers are spacious. Watch out though – the communal showers have no doors or curtains they are separated by gender though. Overall the hostel has a modern stylish feel and the dorms are all reasonably sized 8-bed dorms are the largest you’ll find so you’re not crammed in like sardines!.

Wombats I love Wombats. It’s a bit big for a hostel as there are hundreds of beds the only downside but its filled travelers has really snug beds ensuite bathrooms lockers and a big breakfast. It’s clean and there’s a fully equipped kitchen too. But the real highlight is the rooftop bar with the outdoor patio that offers sweeping views of the city! It’s an awesome spot to drink a beer and meet people! The staff here go over and above too which is a huge perk if you want to ask lots of questions and get some itinerary input.

I had some really fun moments here though there’s not much common space at the hostel so the bar really is the best place to meet people they try to get everyone there to eat and drink as much as possible. If you’re not looking to drink or party this won’t be the best place to stay. But if you are the rooms here are clean and it’s pretty quiet in the hostel itself.

The beds and rooms are average not great but not bad and the lockers in the rooms are very small. But each bunk has a light and power outlet and towels and hair dryers are included. It’s in Kreuzkölln — in the middle of Kreuzberg and Neukölln — which is one of the best areas of Berlin for drinking and dining. If you’re not looking to party and meet people this is a hostel worth staying at.

No they weren’t there to see what this new openly country was really about. They were there on paid press trips funded by a company called Gateway KSA an NGO designed to promote the country. Note The organization says it’s independent of the government but it has Saudi royal family members on its board and given the complete control the family has over the country I doubt they bring in influential Westerners without Royal approval. Now let me be clear I don’t think there’s anything wrong with visiting Saudi Arabia. I have a few friends who just did. If you want to travel somewhere you should. People are not their governments and I’m not one for travel boycotts. But taking money from a government is a lot different than paying your own way. As Rick Steves has said travel is a political act and taking government money can create the impression of tacit approval of it. So when a government offers to sponsor a trip I think the question that needs to be asked is Is this a government I want to appear to support?” The government of Saudi Arabia oppresses its people and promotes extremism abroad. It jails activists including bloggers has a horrible record on women’s and LGBT rights kills journalists Khashoggi is just the most famous example and suppresses dissent tortures detainees uses flogging and amputation as punishments and is among the world’s leading executioners. Those involved in these paid trips say they were simply showing off the destination and the people. It’s not about the government” they said. Saudi Arabia is a beautiful place and there are lots of interesting things to see there.” No doubt there is beauty in that country and no doubt there are incredibly warm and wonderful people there too. Yet I believe that taking money from government-funded organizations creates a moral hazard when you consider that the government jails its own bloggers and disappears” LGBTQ and women’s rights advocates. Psychology has shown time and time again everyone tries to reduce dissonance to justify their actions.2 In this case I think those taking these trips were either just clueless about issues with the countries or created rationalizations when a giant check was waved in front of them. Both reasons are disheartening and are morally shallow. That’s not saying that I always bring up politics or societal conditions in my posts. Or that it’s necessarily the job of a travel writer to always discuss local politics. After all no government is perfect. They all have their faults. You can find terrible things committed by governments around the world. But I think some destinations require more detailed and deeper coverage. How can one go to the Amazon without commenting on policies that lead to its destruction? How can one go on safari without talking about wildlife issues? There are aspects of travel that require more insightful reporting. Places like Saudi Arabia Syria Nicaragua Chile and North Korea for example are among many places that require more rounded reporting given their political situations and the fact that one is in the middle of a civil war. Not bringing up the elephant in the room the government’s actions also does readers a disservice because it may put them at risk when they visit since they might believe they can travel like the influencer did or how they do in the West. Press trips are not like regular trips. They come with handlers special access drivers guides and a host of other benefits a regular traveler will never get. Now there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s one way industry insiders find out what’s new. But washing one’s hands of the political realities of sponsored travel is the problem especially with influencers and bloggers who lack the editorial firewall traditional publications have. It’s why when I asked on a recent survey if people trust bloggers who take a lot of paid trips 85% said no. In another recent study only 4% said they trust online influencers. So prevalent are the hashtags #ad and #sponsored that people tune them out. Sure there have always been paid trips but I feel there’s less of a sense of ethics among modern travel influencers. Looking back on the early days of blogging I feel there were lines we wouldn’t cross — mostly because we were travelers too and we had an idea about the context of the trips we were on. But now there’s more money floating around as millions of dollars per year are thrown at influencers. I’ve been offered huge sums to promote products I once got offered $15000 for a single blog post. It’s hard to turn that down if you don’t have another source of income. Moreover social media didn’t exist when most bloggers started and we had to rely solely on our blogs and in-person relationships. Now with so many platforms so many people competing for gigs so much money out there and the feedback loop social media provides I think people are justifying morally dubious activities in a way that didn’t happen in the past. Yes traditional writers bemoaned us the same way I’m bemoaning influencers” now but I don’t remember standing en masse on people’s rooftops in Greece going off trail to take pictures of flowers or hanging off ledges for the perfect shot the way I see people doing those things now. Too much of today’s content is look at me” not learn from me.” So what can be done? My advice for people who consume travel content is to avoid people who do things that aren’t legal or ethical and don’t paint a full picture of what’s happening in a country. By glossing over thorny issues they make it more likely you’ll think everything is fine and increase the risk of something going wrong. Look for those who are sharing more than pretty photos. Look for those doing things you the consumer can also do not just on a paid promotional trip because those are the ones who are going to be able to help you learn how to travel better in real life. And my fellow creatives I urge you to consider the ethics of who sponsors your trip and to give your readers the most complete and accurate information. Don’t just feature glossy pictures. We get it every place has wonderful people every place has beauty. But some places require more in-depth context. Some paid trips shouldn’t be taken. Because while special access and paid trips are fun they aren’t as fun when the money received from them drips in the blood of the very citizens you are trying to highlight. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. I use them all the time. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness injury theft and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. I’ve been using World Nomads for ten years.

There are far too many travel bloggers & influencers with dubious ethics. It doesn’t help that the platforms make it impossible to report things like undisclosed sponsored trips or illegal behavior like trespassing or unauthorized drone usage. Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 239 pm I see people do so many illegal things for the ‘gram. It’s sickening. Reply Kat S January 8 2020 at 1211 pm Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this. I think they are incredibly on point. I lived in Riyadh for ten summers when I was a child because my mother worked there and while I agree that it’s a beautiful intriguing country to explore the red sand deserts are otherworldly in my memory I would not advocate travelers especially amateur travelers or solo female travelers to just go there. For the same reason that one does not go to North Korea to sightsee. Saudi may be open” to tourism now but that doesn’t automatically mean its culture and people are. Anyway I don’t want to make this too long but just to thank you for using your platform to educate & forewarn people. We need more travel content like you instead of Instaperfect shots with no substance behind it! Reply Oli January 8 2020 at 115 pm I dont really agree. The question is not so much who pays the bill for the trip but if we should promote countries like Saudi Arabia at all. Because lets face the facts Even if bloggers pay the trips by themselves they can only earn commissions if they promote it. So no matter if its a sponsored trip or not there is never a complete independence. So the key question is Shall we promote Saudi Arabia or not? Thats definitely a tough question. One one there are the reasons you have mentioned here on the other hand I would be believe that tourism would help the country to open up and modernize from within – which is certainly a positive development. On the other hand if those efforts to promote tourism fail then its likely that those positive reforms will not be continued. Considering all that I as a blogger would propably also participate on a sponsored trip to Saudi Arabia though a lot.would depend on the fine print of the agreement. Reply Sebrin January 8 2020 at 334 pm I think this is a great post incredibly well balanced. Because if we believe all writers/bloggers have a voice we certainly must understand that the competition for being seen is what motivates a lot of decisions especially when they’re putting their lives/careers on the line to provide ppl with content. But this does not allow them to play ignorant. Their JOB is to provide their point of view yes but not an ignorant one. An informed one that relays both sides so they not only have a well crafted argument but they create trust for their audience. Reply Kirsten January 8 2020 at 1103 pm I would like to visit one day. But I turned down the invite I received to visit on a trip paid for by the Saudi Gov’t for the reasons you talk about here and thanks for doing so. While I’d like to support the people I’d want to find a way to do so which wasn’t paid for and sponsored by a gov’t that kills jails and tortures members of the media and who view women as lesser citizens. Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 237 pm Exactly! 🙂 Reply HERBERT PASTERNAK January 9 2020 at 350 pm A thought provoking article that deserves high praise. Thank you Matt for going off the beaten path of topics and giving your reads something to think about. Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 237 pm Thanks! Reply katherine banks January 9 2020 at 540 pm As bloggers I feel like we have a responsibility to be transparent and let our readers know that our experience is not necessarily the experience they will have. Let them make an informed decision. Reply Nicole January 10 2020 at 1159 am Totally agree with you that readers should be careful in choosing the types of contents to believe in. For instance many photos these days have been so heavily edited that the readers might just get disappointed when they arrive at the actual destinations. Personally I’m okay with reading press trips as they do provide insights especially to new offerings. As long as the content offers a balanced views including risks and challenges is properly disclosed and not against any ethics I think I’m okay….as I understand how content creators need to pay bills too. Reply NomadicMatt January 10 2020 at 232 pm But the rub is that not all content offers balanced views. A lot of what you see from sponsored content is extremely whitewashed. No one wants to bite the hand that feeds them! Reply Nicole January 11 2020 at 1222 pm That’s true. It’s hard to be unbiased with a sponsored post. That’s why it’s very important that the influencer choose carefully what types of jobs to take up like what you’ve suggested. 🙂 Reply Lula Sierra John January 10 2020 at 221 pm So pleased to see you stand for more than free travel. Any trip by visitors to certain countries always makes a statement for that country but if it’s paid for by that country it means they’re looking for approval. There is no question that the approval has to include the politics too when you travel there its not just approval on their beautiful scenery. Time we heard from more courageous people. Reply Rachel Heller January 12 2020 at 1120 am I completely agree with you but I would also add that it’s not just if the government pays for your trip. Even if you paid for it yourself much of the tourism infrastructure is owned by the ruling class. You’d be adding to their income which presumably reinforces their hold on power. Until there is a truly independent tourism infrastructure e.g airbnb-type rooms in people’s houses hotels run by middle-class people not part of the ruling family etc. it’s best not to travel there. Which is really a shame because I would LOVE to see their UNESCO sites. Reply Elisa January 12 2020 at 141 pm Great post! Totally agree . As well even if you pay for your travel expenses you shouldn’t travel in country where there’s a dictatorship or where women are treated as sub-humans and have no rights at all. Some will say that tourists can offer a way of a different way of living to locals but I’m honestly not willing to come to terms with blatant human rights violations. Expecially being a woman. Reply Mary Jo Harte January 12 2020 at 454 pm Great article! So glad to see this addressed!

With world-class beaches unusual wildlife stunning natural landscapes a unique history and a fun and vibrant culture Australia has something to offer every traveler who makes the journey to the Land Down Under. While the country is easy to navigate as a solo traveler there are also plenty of amazing tour options for those who prefer traveling in groups or who might not have the time to plan their own getaway. I’ve been visiting Australia since 2006 and have used many tour companies over the years in addition to getting around on my own. So in this post I share my list of the best travel companies in Australia to help you make the most out of your next trip. From simple walking tours to in-depth multi-day excursions there’s something on the list for every interest — and every budget! Quick Overview Best Bike Tour Bonza Bike Tours Best Walking Tour I’m Free Best Party Tour The Magic Bus Best Multi-Day Tour Intrepid Travel 1. Best Bike Tour Company Bonza Bike Tours Bonza is a bike tour company in Sydney that offers a number of options depending on what you’re interested in. The Highlights tour lasts 2.5 hours and will show you all the major points of interest in Sydney. It’s suitable for families and kids as well costing 99 AUD $68 USD for adults and 79 AUD $54 USD for children. For a more in-depth experience the Classic tour lasts four hours and will give you a much more thorough introduction to this world-class city. They also offer bike rentals so you can just explore the city on your own in case you don’t have the time for a full-tour. —> Click here to learn more about Bonza! 2. Best Walking Tour Company I’m Free I always like to start a trip with a free walking tour as they are a helpful way to get oriented and ask a local all my questions. Both Sydney and Melbourne have insightful and free! walking tours offered by I’m Free. Their tours last 2-3 hours and are a great way to learn about history and culture from a local. There are a few tour options in each city so you have some flexibility with timing as well as which areas you focus on. If you haven’t done much research before your arrival this is a good company to start with. Be sure to tip your guide at the end! —> Click here to learn more about I’m Free! 3. Runner Up Walking Tour Company iCity Tours If you find yourself all the way out in Perth iCity Tours has a handful of awesome free walking tours. They are organized by Visit Perth and run by volunteers so it’s a fun way to interact with the locals and really get a sense of what life is like in Australia’s underrated coastal city. There are five different free tours on offer each lasting around 90 minutes. The Orientation tour offers a quick introduction to the city and its past. If you have more time be sure to check out the Convicts and Colonials tour as well. It will give you a sense of what life was like as a convict in Western Australia. —> Click here to learn more about iCity Tours 4. Best Party Tour Company The Magic Bus This backpacker bus is the perfect choice for travelers looking to party. Each month the trip departs with 25 backpackers aged 18-35 for 3-4 weeks of exploring the country’s national parks camping bonfires and non-stop parties and shenanigans. Trips go from Perth north to Broome or east to Melbourne each month so you have to time your trip accordingly to line up with the set departure. The itineraries are always flexible as they let riders vote on where to go and what to do so every trip is unique. They try to keep a balance of 50% men and 50% women as well as a balance of different nationalities so there is always a diverse group. Trips begin at 1200 AUD $822 USD per person. —> Click here to learn more about The Magic Bus! 5. Runner Up The Oz Experience With The Oz Experience you’ll get a pass for 60-90 days. Instead of guides you’ll be given a list of activities such as diving ATV trips sailing and surfing camps that are included in your pass to do whenever you want based on your schedule. It’s a flexible compromise for people looking for some guidance but who also want independence. Prices vary from 1139 to 3519 AUD $781 to $2412 USD depending on how many excursions are included as well as how many days your bus pass is valid for. While this is a hugely popular option I personally dislike this company. I really found it lacking so I would skip this and take The Magic Bus instead. While lots of people like The Oz Experience I just didn’t find good value for the money. —> Click here to learn more about The Oz Experience! 6. Our Top Tour Pick Intrepid Travel Intrepid is my go-to travel company when it comes to multi-day excursions. In Australia they offer 70 different itineraries to choose from ranging from a quick two-day tour to an in-depth 24-day adventure around the entire country. Unlike some of the companies above this is not a party tour. They are small groups led by expert local guides with a focus on culture history and food as well as ethical travel and leaving a small environmental impact. You’re guaranteed to return home with a much deeper and more nuanced appreciation of your destination. And you’ll get a much broader range of ages and travel styles with Intrepid tours too it’s not just for backpackers.

In fact I’ve always wanted to go to all the Stans”. It’s the region of the world I probably want to visit the most. After having lived in Kazakhstan for 8 years Doug Fears knows a thing or two about the country and how to navigate it. In this guest post Doug offers some in-depth advice about how to travel around Kazakhstan by train! Night spilled across the Kazakh steppe. The train’s steel wheels clickety-clacked below gently prompting me to point toward a bowl of plastic-wrapped apples. Suddenly my drunken dining car companion began gesticulating wildly while repeating his favorite and perhaps only English-language phrase No problem!” With a shake of the head and wave of the hand this newfound friend seemed to dismiss all other apples as second-rate. Apples originated from Kazakhstan after all and we had just departed the city of Almaty the father of apples.” I simply had to try one. It was delicious. Taking the train through Kazakhstan the world’s ninth largest country presents a changing cultural tapestry every time. Imagine a vast land once secretive and closed to outsiders where travelers can now experience an eclectic blend of Silk Road culture offbeat Soviet-era history and wide-open spaces spiced with warm Kazakh hospitality. I’ve shared cabins with young soldiers border police language professors and martial artists just to name a few. My favorite memories are the meals and card games enjoyed with these folks even when I didn’t have a common language. So forget everything about the movie Borat and climb aboard as you browse ancient bazaars ride the rails and trek to pristine mountain lakes. Planning Your Route I suggest the following itinerary flying into the capital Nur-Sultan formerly Astana airport code TSE heading north to nearby Lake Burabay taking a fast train back south to Karaganda then an overnight classic train to Almaty in the southeast with a possible extension to Turkistan a city and region in the south of the country. If you want to continue on in Central Asia you can easily extend your trip from Almaty to see the gorgeous mountain vistas of nearby Kyrgyzstan or continue by train from Turkistan south to Uzbekistan. The best time to go is between May and October as northern Kazakhstan is blanketed in snow from November through April with typical temps in the minus-20 range. Those wanting to snow ski or experience the excitement of New Year’s the country’s biggest holiday however should consider a wintertime trip. Visas are no longer needed for most visitors to Kazakhstan for 30 days and Kyrgyzstan for 60 days though advance visas are required for Uzbekistan Russia and China. Buying Train Tickets There are three types of trains the fast business-class Talgo regular long-distance trains and regional electrics. Budget travelers should opt for regular trains for most trips. Regional electrics are generally slow and will be of limited use. On regular trains — highly recommended for the best cultural experience — the two main classes are kupe a four-person closed compartment with two upper and lower bunks and platzkar an open rolling dormitory holding 54 travelers on two-level bunks. The kupe is quieter and more private but single women might want to choose the somewhat safer open platzkar as they could be in a locked cabin with three men no gender distinctions are made when making reservations. Also realize that not all trains run daily. The new Kazakhstan e-ticket website is not easy to use while there is an English menu it requires you to enter destination cities using a Russian keyboard! Some foreign bankcards won’t work for payment and even successful ticket purchases are often blocked by spam filters. However there is an option to chat online with an English-language consultant who can help you find and purchase tickets. My suggestion is to use this site as a reference to find train timetables and to purchase long-distance train tickets that are more likely to be sold out. You can use the helpful site Real Russia for international train ticket purchases especially for traveling from Moscow to Central Asia. Then go to a train station or train ticket office in the city as some have kiosk machines that you can try. Another option is to write your destination and date on a piece of paper and present it to a ticket agent at a station or train office for help. Once you have your ticket the most important things to know are the date and time of departure and wagon number. Check the posted signs in the station to find which platform number your train is on and walk toward that wagon — the conductor will check your ID and ticket and help you board. Kazakhstan Costs Traveling by train is much safer and enjoyable than by bus and an incredible value for the long distances traveled. A standard overnight train ticket from Karaganda to Almaty will be about $9 USD for platzkar and $14 for kupe. By comparison the business-class Talgo on the same route costs $25 in a four-berth kupe but it does reduce travel time by six hours and has much cleaner bathrooms!. A night train provides double value serving as both bed and transport they are cooler and more comfortable in the summer travel season too! Local city buses are cheap about $0.20 per ride regardless of distance. Hotel rooms in the city centers of Nur-Sultan and Almaty range from $30 to $50 per night with breakfast. Full apartments $25/night or shared guest rooms $10/night can be booked on Airbnb. Food is also reasonably priced. I suggest finding a hotel with breakfast included on booking.com eating picnic-style meals on the train and enjoying a streetside café for other meals grilled shashlik skewers bread salad and drink for about $4 though if you can’t peel it or cook it it’s best to forget it. And make sure to try the local apples! Essential Kazakhstan Travel Hacks Do reserve an upper bunk if you like relaxing onboard lower bunks are shared during the daytime and used for communal meals but you need to be reasonably fit to climb the mini-ladder. Do bring a comfortable change of clothes to wear onboard track suit shorts and T-shirt. It’s perfectly normal to ask others to step outside while you change. Do bring extra food to share tea/coffee instant noodles sausage cucumbers bread biscuits apples sweets. Note there is always a steaming samovar of hot water in each car for making tea or noodles. Do pack a small train kit mug fork/spoon/knife toilet paper plate wet wipes plastic sandals collapsible hand fan deck of cards bottled water. Do take your street shoes off when entering a train compartment. Do plan your bathroom visits as the toilets are locked about 15 minutes before and after station stops read the timetable posted in each wagon. Do take some small gifts from your home country magnets key rings to share. Don’t buy unsold seats from touts lurking around stations — I’ve been stuck sharing a four-berth kupe with six people plus a giant-screen TV! Don’t get scolded for lying on a bare mattress but don’t pay extra for sheets and towels in kupe class. They are now included in the kupe ticket fare but beware you may be awakened very early by the conductor collecting them on overnight trains! Don’t be bullied by transport police or immigration officials at borders — show your passport and ticket and nothing more. Don’t miss your stop get stranded on the platform buying ice cream or above all be forced to jump off a moving train! Best Kazakhstan Train Routes Because of the challenges with the ticketing website I’ve listed the most helpful train routes for getting around. Note that all of these run daily. While northbound trains from Nur-Sultan stop at Borovoye/Shchuchinsk it might be easier to take a shared van or minibus for the short 2.5-hour trip. Just listen or ask for Borovoye” at the Nur-Sultan-1 train station where vans wait to fill up and leave throughout the day. You can do the same if heading directly south from Nur-Sultan to Karaganda as a new tollway has opened cutting the travel time between these two major cities to two hours although all Nur-Sultan-to-Almaty trains also stop there. Note that both Nur-Sultan and Almaty have two train stations in different parts of the city — make sure you go to the right one! Train #031 from Almaty to Semey in the northeast traces the historical TurkSib” route — from here you can head east to explore the Altay Mountains or continue north into Russia to connect with the legendary Trans-Siberian route.

Other off-the-beaten-track locations such as the Baykonur rocket base and Altay Mountains require special permission and advance planning. Here’s an overview of the major destinations Nur-Sultan formerly Astana – one of the world’s youngest capital cities a futuristic Tomorrowland-esqe blend of gleaming buildings shopping centers and sculpted monuments. Lake Burabay formerly Borovoye – a scenic forested lake resort just 2.5 hours north of Nur-Sultan featuring a wide range of accommodations and attractions. Karaganda – Kazakhstan’s third city” with its leafy wide boulevards is a good base for exploring Soviet-era history particularly the museum of political repression at nearby Dolinka one of the largest labor camps in the Gulag system. Almaty – Central Asia’s most cosmopolitan city. The stunning backdrop of the Tien Shan Mountains frames this busy business center a great base for making day trips to the nearby mountains the skate/ski center at Medeu/Chimbulak and the red rock Charyn Canyon. Turkistan – Kazakhstan’s holiest site and the country’s best place to see Silk Road architecture and tile work. Baykonur Cosmodrome – the world’s most active launch site for manned space missions. Rocket enthusiasts will need to book well in advance with an agency like Nomadic Travel Kazakhstan to try and see a launch. The Far Northeast – Well off the beaten path Semey Ust-Kamenogorsk and the pristine Altay Mountains are in a beautiful region worth the extra effort to see. Visiting the sensitive border zone or former Polygon nuclear test site will require special permits and advance planning. *** As a child of the Cold War era I recall hiding under my desk during drills to the sound of air-raid sirens as we lived in genuine fear of nuclear war. I never dreamed I would visit the big blank spots on the map labeled USSR” especially the Siberian steppe and Central Asia. Nowadays with internet communication and open borders an amazing opportunity awaits to wander across these once-forbidden zones sharing goodwill and learning something too. And one final tip make sure to buy apples before you board the train! Though I only visited the train’s dining car once I did purchase the pack of shiny apples that evening munching on what I figured was a true local delicacy.

There’s a lot more to the country than just all-inclusive resorts! In this guest post she offers some an in-depth breakdown of how to travel around Cuba like a local. I’ve been traveling between Cuba and the US since I was born. Actually even before I was born my mom came to the States when she was pregnant with me. I like to say I was made in Havana and born in the USA. As a Cuban-American who wrote a book on the country and runs tours there I’ve made it my mission to share my appreciation for Cuban culture with everyone who wants to experience it. People frequently ask me if Cuba is expensive. It doesn’t have to be. It can be quite an affordable place to visit. From obvious tried-and-true advice like eat at locations at least three blocks away from popular tourist sites to little-known tips only the locals know here’s how to experience Cuba on a budget. 1. How to save money on Cuban currency exchanges Cuban currency cannot be purchased overseas as it is not traded internationally so you’ll need to get it on arrival. Cuba has two currencies the CUC which is what tourists and visitors use and the CUP also called the peso used by everyone else. As a visitor all your transactions will be done in CUC which is roughly equal to one US dollar. There are about 25 CUP to 1 CUC. In a country with 2 currencies it is important to know the difference between a CUP and CUC. For example you don’t want to overpay in CUC when something is priced in CUP. And when you receive change from a CUC make sure the change is not in CUP. The best way to keep them straight is to remember that a CUC has monuments on its face and a CUP or peso has pictures of people. Once in Cuba you should exchange money at the airport CADECA.” A CADECA is the official government exchange location. Keep in mind that you will need your passport in order to exchange currency. Change only enough to get you to your accommodation then change more at the CADECAs in town as they have better rates. Avoid exchanging currency at banks and hotels as these offer less favorable rates. US citizens should be aware that credit cards drawn on US banks are not accepted in Cuba and ATMs cannot dispense money from US banks so you must bring enough cash to last the entire trip. 2. How to save money on your accommodations in Cuba For the best value for your money you can’t beat a casa particular. Casas particulares or casas for short are the homes of local Cubans who rent rooms to visitors like a B&B. You can rent a room in a private home for an average of 30 CUC per night. The best part of staying with a Cuban family is that you can have an authentically Cuban experience. You eat with them hang out in their living room play with their kids or pets. You’re treated like one of the family while you are there. That’s a lot more rewarding than staying at a sterile hotel. It’s easy to book a casa. You can reserve on Airbnb or any number of similar online sites though Airbnb often has the largest selection and one of the few sites Americans can widely use. You should pre-book a casa from home at least for your first night’s stay in Cuba. Once in Cuba you can book the following nights yourself either through your host or just by looking for a house with the casa sign a blue anchor with a roof on a white background and simply knocking on the door. Otherwise hostels will be your best option for saving money. Some top-rated Havana hostels include the following Cuba 58 Hostel Casa Rene & Madelyn Hostal DRobles Casa Novo Guest House Hostal Corazón del Mundo Casa Zeila Prices per night range from around 5 to 15 CUC though most are around 11 CUC. I find casas to be the best accommodation option. A hostel may be cheaper but there are many casas with hostel pricing so you get the best of both worlds low cost plus interaction with a local family. Isn’t the connection with other cultures one of the main reasons we travel? 3. The best places to eat in Cuba without breaking the bank The best places to eat in Cuba are paladares. These are privately owned vs. government owned restaurants. There are all types of paladares from high-end establishments in renovated mansions to hole-in-the-wall stands. Traditional dishes you will find at paladares include arroz con pollo chicken and rice ropa vieja shredded beef and lechón roast pork. Typical drinks include the classic mojito daiquiri and Cuba Libre. Fruit juices are also readily available. The local beers Bucanero and Cristal are very good. Any guidebook will point out the paladares. You can also find them in the A La Mesa app. Typical costs in CUCs for meals in paladares are as follows High-end paladar Lunch 10–25 Dinner 15–35 Mid-range paladar Lunch 7–10 Dinner 10–25 Some of my favorite paladares in Havana include Doña Eutemia near the cathedral Los Mercaderes and San Cristóbal where US President Obama had lunch. A typical meal at one of these will cost about 15–20 CUC. Street vendors are also found throughout the country and offer little sandwiches pizza croquettes pastries and other snacks for 1 to 3 CUC. The food is not great but it certainly is budget-friendly. 4. Cuban transportation on a budget Transportation is likely to be your biggest expense with taxis being the most common. Rule number one for getting around in Cuba is to negotiate before getting in. Tell the driver where you want to go or show him in writing and ask how much ¿Cuánto?”. Whatever the driver says counter with a couple of CUCs lower. The drivers are used to this they generally start at a higher rate anticipating that they will end up with a lower fee. Yellow taxis are government-run vs. privately owned. These are used by tourists and tend to be the most expensive. Coco-taxis are essentially motorcycles with a cover shaped to look like a yellow coconut hence the name and they are everywhere. They tend to be cheaper but can only take two people at a time. Bici-taxis are rickshaw-like bicycles that’ll take you around Old Havana. Another option is the colectivo or collective taxi. These are cars that travel busy thoroughfares within city limits picking up and dropping off people as they go along. A trip from one end of a busy central street to the other or anywhere in between will cost about half a CUC. The taxi is shared with up to six people. Buses are overcrowded unreliable and not air-conditioned but they are very cheap. They travel major routes mostly outside Old Havana. Typical transportation costs Yellow government taxi 10 CUC within city limits Coco-taxi 5 CUC within city limits only fits 2 people Bici-taxi 2 CUC per person only fits 2 people not motorized Collective taxi Half a CUC per trip in a shared taxi Bus About 0.20 CUC A fun way to explore a big city like Havana is by taking a tour in a classic American convertible from the ’50s but at 40 to 50 CUC an hour they aren’t very budget-friendly. 5. Staying connected in Cuba without paying a fortune Internet access in Cuba is iffy. It is not offered everywhere and where it is it is unreliable. The best way to stay connected is to purchase an internet connection card sold in increments of 1 CUC per hour at the local ETECSA the Cuban government’s telecommunications office with branches all over the island. You use the login and password on the card to connect your phone or computer. You can also purchase an internet connection card at most high-end hotels but the cost can be as high at 7 CUC per hour so purchasing your card at an ETECSA is a huge savings. Once you have your card find a location where you can connect. Most parks have connectivity as do areas around ETECSA offices. Just look for groups of people huddled over their phones. Higher-end hotels also offer Wi-Fi at outrageous fees. If you don’t use up your internet time the leftover will be saved on your card and you will be able to use it again. A typical daily budget For a typical day in Havana Cuba’s most expensive city you can expect to budget as follows Breakfast at your casa 5 CUC Street food snacks 2–5 CUC Lunch at a paladar 5–7 CUC Dinner at a paladar 5–10 CUC Alcoholic beverage mojito 2–3 CUC beer 2 CUC rum 5 CUC/bottle Room in a casa average 30 CUC Intracity taxi 2–10 CUC Museum entrance fee 2–8 CUC Entrance fee to a music venue free or 2–10 CUC Internet connection card 1–2 CUC To be on the safe side and leave yourself a little room to splurge budget 100 CUC/day. Keep in mind you may want to purchase the world-famous cigars and rum. The local art you find at the many galleries around town may also appeal to you. Traveling outside of Havana When traveling outside Havana you’ve got a couple of options. The most convenient and expensive is to reserve a taxi that will pick you up at your casa and deliver you door to door. Your casa host or hostel or hotel staff can arrange one for you. Another option is the national bus service which extends across the entire country. The buses are air-conditioned and the prices are very reasonable. Prices from Havana to popular destinations are as follows Havana to Viñales 12 CUC Havana to Trinidad 25 CUC Havana to Varadero 10 CUC Havana to Santiago on the far side of the island 51 CUC You need to purchase your tickets at the Viazul bus station at Avenida Independencia #101 at the corner of 19 de Mayo. The buses will take you to the bus stations in your destination city which are generally in very central locations convenient to wherever you want to go. There are car rental agencies throughout Cuba with which you can organize a self-drive tour. However keep in mind that the roads outside Havana can be in very poor condition and difficult to navigate. With easy transportation within the big cities and convenient bus service between cities a car rental may not be your most budget-friendly option. Domestic flights are pretty unreliable and I wouldn’t recommend it. *** Before traveling to Cuba US citizens should check the travel requirements. Ordinary tourism is prohibited for US citizens. All US visitors must travel to Cuba under one of 12 US government approved categories. Support for the Cuban People” is the most commonly used category and can be selected when purchasing the airline ticket. Experiencing Cuba on a budget certainly has its challenges but it is totally worth it. Cuba gets under your skin quickly. It bewitches and beckons you to explore more of it. No matter how many times I return to Cuba I always find something to amaze me a new art venue a remarkable piece of 18th century architecture or an innovative take on traditional Cuban cuisine. Cuba is a safe beautiful country with welcoming people and a fascinating culture. Put it on your must-visit list and you won’t be disappointed.

As a lover of history I long to release my inner archaeologist and explore the many ruins of the country. While it might be a long time before I get there my friend Jeremy Scott Foster from TravelFreak has visited a couple of times. In this guest post he’ll give you his best tips for saving money on your next visit to Egypt! I’ve been to Egypt twice. On my first trip four years ago I solo traveled the Sinai Peninsula along the Gulf of Aqaba stayed in shared hostels for $5 USD per night and took overnight buses that cost just as little. On my most recent trip last year I traveled from the very north of Egypt in Alexandria south to Cairo and then further south along the Nile River to the border with Sudan. And throughout it all I fall deeply in love with this country where foreign perception of violence keeps so many at arm’s length. The tourism industry in Egypt is still feeling pain as a result of the political upheaval civil unrest and terrorism-related activities that have marred its recent history. As tourist numbers have dwindled and competition for the tourist dollar has become fiercer travel deals have proliferated. But what most visitors miss is what you can gain — free of crowds and for little money too. From the chaos of Cairo to the more laid-back vibe of Luxor Egypt is an ideal destination for budget travelers. 1. How to Save Money on Accommodation Generally speaking accommodation in Egypt is relatively affordable. However there are a few helpful tricks that can cut down your expenses. Stay in hostels instead of hotels – Typically you can expect to find a bed in a shared dorm room with 4+ beds for between $5-8 USD per night or a comfortable private single room for about $15 USD per night. You will likely have to share a bathroom but at least you have your privacy. Use Hostelworld to look for the best prices. I recommend Dahab Hostel in Cairo and Al Salam Camp in Luxor. Use Booking.com to compare prices for hotels – If you’re looking for cheap hotels or guesthouses in Egypt I recommend checking Booking.com. A private room in a guesthouse or hotel goes for about $40 USD per night. Prices are generally listed per room not per person. So if you are traveling with a friend you can save even more money by splitting the cost. Look for accommodations that add offer a little extra – I also found that coupled with accommodation it was pretty common for hosts in guesthouses to offer extras such as breakfast and local tours at very reasonable prices. One of my incredible hosts cooked a traditional hot breakfast with tea and coffee for just $1 USD. Best of all he was more than happy to recommend some inexpensive local places to eat and buy food. Look beyond the standard hotel rooms for accommodation options – Vrbo and HomeAway are great Airbnb alternatives as they’ve been connecting budget travelers and homeowners since the ’90s. HomeAway is geared towards people wanting a proper vacation rental so you can expect a fully furnished home to live in which is great for longer stays. Vrbo lets you stay in a local’s house but at a slightly increased cost. You can usually find some pretty luxurious apartments starting from $50 USD per night. The upside is that you’ll have full access to your own kitchen which means you can further cut your costs by cooking at home. 2. How to Save Money on Food Stick to the local eats and street food – If you want to save money on food while traveling in Egypt do yourself a favor and steer clear of the Western chain food joints. While a cheeseburger is about half the price of what you pay at home it’s still more expensive less tasty and far less adventurous than experiencing the local cuisine. Why bother with a burger when you can eat the most delicious falafel in the world for $1 USD? Navigate the narrow alleyways of any bustling Cairo market like Khan El Khalili or Mohammed Ali Street to seek out the best shawarma $2 USD. Or grab a stuffed falafel sandwich from a street vendor on your way from one ancient relic to another $2 USD. You can literally find Arabic bread for 5 cents. It’s all cheap and very filling. And the hummus. It’s so. Darn. Good. If you’re staying at a guesthouse it’s common practice for them to offer full dinners for about $10 USD. The truth is that they’re actually just sourcing the food from restaurants in the neighborhood and taking a cut so by seeking out your own food options expect to spend about ¼ of the price. With that said don’t be afraid of street food or street vendors especially if the food is cooked in front of you. And if there is a crowd of locals waiting then chances are you’re onto a good thing. Eat at a kosheri – A kosheri is a small local restaurant that serves up generous portions of pasta chickpeas lentils etc. often for less than $1 USD! There’s no menu you just select the size of your portion and then you’re served this mishmash of deliciousness. Cook your own meals – As mentioned preparing your own meals while traveling is also a great money saver. If you have access to a kitchen just ask your host to point you in the direction of the nearest market. They also have the lowdown on where to eat for cheap so take advantage of their local knowledge! 3. How to Save Money on Transportation Bargain with your taxi driver – In most Egyptian cities taxis are an inexpensive and convenient way to get around. Now when I say convenient I mean they’ll get you to where you need to go relatively quickly. But I would be remiss if I didn’t add a few disclaimers. Taxi drivers can be aggressive on the road leaving you white-knuckled from hanging on for dear life. I’ve never experienced a more heart-stopping journey than a Cairo taxi ride. Furthermore while Cairo does have metered taxis don’t be lulled into a false sense of security. Meters are notoriously unreliable or rigged and drivers frequently forget” to turn them on. It’s one of the oldest travel scams in the book. The best practice is to use an unmetered taxi and agree on a price with the driver before getting in. Outside Cairo most taxis are unmetered so no matter what always agree on a price upfront. If you’re not sure how much is an acceptable price ask someone at your hostel or guesthouse for a pricing recommendation and then start your bargaining at about ½ that price. Oftentimes even they will give you a higher estimate than is normal it’s locals helping locals but the real price should be about ¾ of what you’ve been recommended. For longer-distance trips hiring a car with a driver is the most cost-effective option. The price will be the same whether you’re traveling by yourself or with a group of four so round up some travel buddies and split the cost. But of course be prepared for some aggressive haggling to get the best price. Be clear about where you want to go and for how long you will need the driver. Don’t worry if negotiations break down though. When it comes to haggling over price never be afraid to walk away. There are plenty of drivers available so just move on to the next one. Take the local train – Taking the train between Alexandria Cairo Luxor and Aswan is the most popular mode of transport for this route. If time or budget is a concern you can take an overnight train. By taking the sleeper train from Cairo to Luxor or Aswan you’ll save a night’s worth of accommodation in a hotel. A deluxe sleeper cabin for one is about $110 USD while a two-berth cabin is $80 USD per person. Cabins are secure and fares include an airline-style dinner and breakfast. The food is basic but it’s edible. But for a real bargain you can book the day train between Cairo and Luxor or Aswan for as little as $10 USD. However there’s one caveat for safety reasons the Egyptian government prohibits foreigners from purchasing day train tickets for this route. Officials say this is because only the night trains have armed guards in case of a terrorist attack but this is an incredibly rare occurrence. It’s easy to get around this though. You’ll need to book tickets online at enr.gov.eg you’ll have to register an account but it’s easy to do or ask your guide host or driver to book the tickets for you. They will likely oblige for a small fee. There are no reports of ticket attendants kicking any foreigners off the day train so you’ll be fine. And if not you’re only out $10 USD. Get the Flight Pass – The fastest way to travel around Egypt is by plane. Egypt Air is the national carrier and Star Alliance Member serving most major domestic destinations. Its Flight Pass is a cost-effective option that allows you to lock in low fares for domestic flights even if you haven’t determined your travel dates. All you have to do is purchase a minimum of four flights or credits and choose a time when you’d like to travel in the next 12 months. You can then book your flight up to seven days before departure. On the downside you’ll have to always fly back to your original departure point. That is instead of flying from Cairo to Luxor and Alexandria you’ll need to fly Cairo to Luxor and back to Cairo before going to Alexandria. That said the Flight Pass is still about 30% cheaper than booking the same multi-destination flights with other airlines. The Flight Pass is super customizable. You can select the number of flights e.g. four which is two round-trip flights for a period of time e.g. within one month and also how early you can book your flights e.g. one week before travel. This means that if you pick Cairo as your origin you can select two round-trip flights to Aswan Luxor Alexandria Sharm E Sheikh or Hurghada. Each flight is $73 USD one-way. But if I were to book a flight from Cairo to Luxor for one week from now that same leg would cost at least $142 USD! You can play around with this pass. For example if you purchase a similar pass to the one above but select one month” for how early you can book the flights become $66 USD each per one-way. If that’s too much of an inconvenience for you there are plenty of other airlines offering affordable flights. When it comes to finding cheap flights on other airlines I use Skyscanner. By being flexible with your dates you can save up to 50%. Keep in mind though that you might be traveling at inconvenient times like the middle of the night. In the Skyscanner search bar instead of entering specific dates select the Entire Month” option. This will show you a calendar with fare prices for departing and returning flights for every day of the month. This also works for one-way flights. However it does not work for multicity flights. 4. How to Save Money on Tours and Guides The best money-saving tip I can offer here is to avoid booking online before you arrive in Egypt. If you’re a Type A traveler who needs a plan in hand before you even arrive you’re not going to like this. But online agencies charge massively inflated prices and you will end up paying a lot less if you deal directly with the tour company or guide locally on the ground. Add in the feel-good factor of your money going directly to your guide their family and community and not to some middle person agency or large corporation and you’ve got yourself a win-win situation. You may need to be a little more flexible with your dates. But you will have the added advantage of being able to negotiate haggle in reality which translates to overall savings. Tours private drivers and the quintessential cruise down the Nile can all be booked locally at significantly lower prices than booking in advance. So if you can stomach it wait until you get your boots on the ground before booking your tours. Guides in my experience are an invaluable source of local knowledge and information. They have the inside scoop on the best vantage points for photos at all the epic landmarks. In addition they’re great at dealing with those persistent and sometimes aggressive street vendors. The best guides can be found by asking for recommendations from other travelers who have used their services but I always recommend my Egyptian brother Rami. Back in 2015 on my first trip to Egypt Rami and I connected by way of a mutual friend. We hit it off and ever since then I’ve helped him to grow the little tour business he and his family-run. It feels good to be able to help a local family in such a positive way. He’s honest affordable reliable incredibly communicative well connected and did I mention honest? That’s one of the difficult parts about traveling in places like Egypt when people are selling you things it’s hard to know who you can trust. But Rami is my man. Send him an email at ramielshaer2@gmail.com and let him know Jeremy sent you there are no commissions here — this is just a helpful referral to a well-deserving friend. He will sort you out or put you in touch with someone else in your preferred destination. 5. How to Save Money on Entrance and Admission Fees Get the International Student Identity Card – Entrance and admission prices for almost all monuments and attractions in Egypt are set as advertised. However you can get discounted tickets with an International Student Identity Card including 50% off some of Egypt’s best museums including the Luxor. Get a travel pass – You can get a Cairo Pass or a Luxor Pass multi-entrance discount passes from the Ministry of Antiquities the Egyptian Museum or the Giza Plateau for about $80 USD. You’ll save about 50% off entries to over 30 attractions in Cairo and Giza. You’ll find very little information about these passes online however so your best bet is to just show up at one of those locations and inquire there. Suggested Budgets for Traveling in Egypt While you can spend money on luxury resorts or private tours it’s entirely possible to travel through Egypt on the cheap. In fact you can easily spend as little as $30-$35 USD a day. The biggest way to reduce costs is to stay in dorm rooms or hostels. If you opt for a private room or mid-range hotel you can expect to spend $30-40 USD more per night. Where and what you eat also adds to your daily budget. For example street food is an affordable and filling option for dining in Egypt. You can eat everything from falafel and sandwiches to shawarma and koshari noodles for as little as $1 USD. Eating in a restaurant is more expensive but still relatively cheap compared to Western countries. Meals in a mid-range restaurant start at $4 USD while international dishes can be around $10 USD. Transportation is another added cost. Train travel can be cheap but may not be the most efficient option if your time is limited. So if you plan to fly between your destinations expect to add $50-$100 USD to your budget for each flight. Of course your daily budget will also increase if you book private guides or splurge on souvenirs and gifts. And remember haggling is one of the most important skills if you’re looking to save money in Egypt. Taxis excursions and other services can usually be bargained down to a lower rate than what is initially quoted. So if you have a high tolerance for haggling your daily budget could easily be less. Regardless it’s always better to go slightly over budget especially somewhere with as many must-see sights and experiences as Egypt! *** The key to budget travel in Egypt is to be generally well informed and to have a good sense of humor the latter goes a long way when dealing with vendors. Haggling and scammers are all part of everyday travel life in Egypt. There are very few goods and services that can’t be bargained for. Most importantly always ALWAYS ask for and agree on a price first before accepting any goods or services. Most importantly don’t be afraid to politely say no and walk away. Now it’s time to start planning your trip to Egypt for maximum adventures at minimum cost in the land of Pharaohs pyramids and wonders of the ancient world. Get to it!

From staying in hostels to taxi bargains. The food tip is really the key. You should experience the local food and it will taste much better than the western one. A win-win situation no doubt. But one thing I’m not sure about is taking night buses. I mean wouldn’t it ruin the whole purpose of travelling in a new city. You would want to experience the daytime liveliness and views which you would miss if you cut cost there. Anyway a great travel guide man. Thanks! Reply Jeremy Scott Foster February 9 2020 at 551 pm I think it ultimately comes down to how much time you have available and what your priorities are. If you’re interested in the landscapes and maybe making some friends on the bus then a daytime bus would be great! If your goal is just to get somewhere then a night bus is definitely the way to go. Reply Mark February 7 2020 at 524 pm Great tips. Spot on regarding haggling. To get the best deals in Egypt and many parts of the world you need to know how to haggle well. In my experience it also helps to learn a bit of Arabic as almost no tourists bother to do so. It will set you apart from the crowd and endear you more to the locals. Most Egyptians are incredibly warm and friendly people and you will have a much richer experience as a result. Reply Jeremy Scott Foster February 9 2020 at 552 pm That’s a great tip! Learning a new language is always helpful no matter where you go. Reply Blanca February 9 2020 at 643 pm So many great tips! Can’t wait to visit Egypt but having to be alert all the time to avoid being ripped off makes me nervous… Haggling can be fun if you have a good sense of humor and some patience but it truly gets exhausting when you need to negotiate a fair price for absolutely everything. Reply Brian Lum February 11 2020 at 651 pm Fantastic tips! I’m pretty new when it comes to street food and have had a few bad experiences. I know you said that street vendors can be the way to go and the falafel sounds amazing but is there any food you think we should stay away from?

Though a small country that doesn’t take too long to drive around there’s just SO much on offer that you could still easily spend weeks here and not run out of amazing sights to see activities to do and delicious food to eat. To help you get started planning your trip here’s a list of what I consider to be some of the best things to see and do in Israel 1. Tel Aviv With almost four million people in the greater Tel Aviv area this beach city on the Mediterranean has a lively cosmopolitan vibe. It’s the country’s most modern city and where the majority of international flights arrive there are also international airports in Haifa and Eilat but Tel Aviv is the main point of arrival. While the city has a lot to offer including 13 beaches one of the major draws is the food. The culinary scene is full of inventive eateries using fresh organic ingredients and mixing traditional Israeli cuisine with tastes from around the world reflecting the many ethnicities that make up the country’s population. There’s even a huge number of vegan options too Israel is an incredible destination for vegetarian and vegan travelers. You can also stroll the stalls at the Carmel Market and the Levinsky Market for tasty local street food. Tel Aviv also has a nightlife that would rival New York or London. For a night out you can find rooftop bars wine bars and craft beer breweries all over town. In particular check out venues lining Rothschild Boulevard. Also there’s a strong music scene with tons of live concerts happening around town in all genres as well as a world-class philharmonic orchestra. There’s lots of great theatre here too! During the day visit any of dozens of museums including the popular Yitzhak Rabin Center the Tel Aviv Museum of Art or the Museum of the Jewish People. Tel Aviv also has many informative and insightful walking tour companies to help you learn more about the city’s past its people its street art and its architecture Tel Aviv’s Bauhaus structures the White City” is a UNESCO World Heritage site. New Europe is the best free walking tour in town just be sure to tip. And don’t miss the ancient port of Jaffa home to a large flea market an artists quarter fine restaurants a mixed population of Arabs and Jews and great views of Tel Aviv. 2. The Dead Sea Israel and Jordan share the Dead Sea. Covering over 600 square kilometers its shores are the lowest point on earth and its water is so salty — over eight times more than the ocean — that virtually no sea life can survive in it hence its name. That saltiness also means you float on the water salt increases buoyancy which is why you’ll see lots of people here snapping pictures as they float the day away. Unfortunately it also means that if you have any cuts on your body you will feel them keenly! Additionally industrial exploitation has shrunk the shoreline and caused sinkholes in some areas so beware of that and pay attention to any signage. The salt and other minerals like magnesium and bromide have historically been thought of as healing which is why there are tons of health retreats lining the shore. While many beaches are only accessible through a resort there are also several public ones along the coast including Neve Midbar in the north and Ein Bokek in the south. 3. Jerusalem Jerusalem is one of the oldest cities in the world with its history stretching back about 5000 years. Referred to as the Holy City” in Arabic al-Quds Jerusalem holds an important place in three of the world’s major religions Christianity Judaism and Islam. Home to over a million people it’s a destination for pilgrims and tourists alike brimming with an incredible and often controversial history. The walled Old City not to mention nearby Mount Zion and the City of David the original site of Jerusalem include so many famous and significant sites that you could easily spend several days touring them. For Jews the Western Wall formerly called the Wailing Wall is considered the holiest place for prayer. It is divided into men’s and women’s sections and there are tunnels on one side that can be explored. The Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount just above the Western Wall are among the holiest sites for Muslims behind only Mecca and Medina. For Christians the Via Dolorosa and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City mark the path of Jesus’s final walk to his execution and the site of his crucifixion. In the western newer section of Jerusalem be sure to visit Yad Vashem the deeply emotional official memorial for the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. There’s also the Israel Museum which is home to the Dead Sea Scrolls and other treasures of Israel’s past. For an insightful overview of the city take a walking tour or food tour. There’s the Machane Yehuda market tour and Abraham Tours which also runs an amazing hostel organizes daily walking tours highlighting Jerusalem’s past from different and often competing perspectives. 4. Biblical Sites As an epicenter for three major religions Israel has a lot of important shrines and pilgrimage destinations. A large number of travelers join biblical tours either guided tours or self-guided ones to visit places like the Galilee Bethlehem and Jericho the latter two in Palestine. Galilee is home to a number of Christian sites including Nazareth where you’ll find the largest church in the Middle East and the Jesus Trail or the Gospel Trail hikes from Nazareth to the Sea of Galilee — which is also home to numerous sites of Christian interest such as Capernaum Tabgha where Jesus fed people loaves and fishes Cana and the Mount of Beatitudes the supposed location of the Sermon on the Mount. Known as the birthplace of Jesus Bethlehem is a must-visit destination. Be sure to visit the Church of the Nativity one of the most important Christian sites ostensibly where Jesus was born and also one of the world’s oldest operating churches it opened in 333 CE. Near Jericho you’ll find Qasr el Yahud on the Jordan River said to be the place where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and the Monastery of St George a cliff-hanging complex carved into a sheer rock wall in the Judean Desert. 5. The Negev Desert The Negev Desert covers the southern half of Israel and spans over 13000 square kilometers taking up 55% of the entire country. It’s a starkly beautiful place. For the best views visit the Florence and George Wise Observatory near Mitzpe Ramon. Also don’t miss Timna Park in the far south near Eilat which has incredible geological formations huge sandstone pillars and sand of many colors. There’s also an annual hot air balloon festival held there each autumn. The Negev is full of all kinds of adventure activities too from sandboarding in the dunes in the north to rappelling off the cliffs of the Ramon Crater. If you don’t have a car you’ll find no shortage of tour companies to take you around. 6. Masada National Park and Fortress One of the most-visited parts of the Negev Desert is Masada National Park. Located just 100km 62 miles south of Jerusalem on the edge of the Dead Sea this was the ancient fortress built by King Herod the Great on a plateau. It’s famed for being a refuge for Jewish rebels against the Roman Empire who lived up there for seven years before committing mass suicide after a siege by the Romans back in 73 CE. Today it’s a symbol of Israeli determination and one of the country’s most popular attractions. There’s a cable car up to the fortress but an alternative is to hike up the Snake Path a 60-90-minute hike offering views of the arid landscape the Dead Sea and Jordan. Just be aware that it can be really hot in summer it’s a desert after all and sometimes authorities close the path if the weather is too hot. Bring lots of water. It’s better and cooler to ascend before dawn and see the sunrise over Jordan from the trail or the summit. Open daily from 8am until 3pm-5pm. Admission to the park is $9 USD. You can reach the park in about 90 minutes from Jerusalem by car. 7. Dive Israel’s Reefs and Wrecks Israel borders the Mediterranean Sea and has a short coastline on the Red Sea — both of which offer world-class snorkeling and scuba diving. Some of the best spots on the Red Sea where you can see incredible coral and sea life include Coral Reef Beach Migdalor Beach and Princess Beach. For scuba divers the water deepens very quickly off Eilat so you can do deep-water diving without needing to use a boat to get further from the shore. Those who don’t wish to go in the water can visit the Underwater Observatory Marine Park. On the Mediterranean coast divers can explore shipwrecks and ancient Roman ruins at the Underwater Archaeological Park at Caesarea. 8. Israel’s Lesser-Known Archaeological Sites There has been human activity in what is now Israel for over 100000 years making the region incredibly rich when it comes to archaeological finds. While most people are familiar with the main sites such as Jerusalem Caesarea and Masada there are actually tons more to see throughout the country. In fact there are more than 300 excavations active in Israel which means that there are new discoveries being made all the time. Here are some of the best lesser-known sites Megiddo – Located southeast of Haifa this was once a fortified city with its origins going back to around 3000 BCE. The Hebrew name Har Megiddo” Mount Megiddo became in Greek Armageddon” as this is the supposed site of the end-times battle. Today the ruins host an excellent and informative museum that sheds light on the area and its sprawling history. Templars’ Tunnel in Akko – This secret tunnel was built by the medieval Templars at their fortress in Akko Acre in the 13th century. It stretches 150m and was only discovered in 1994. The site is accessible to the public which means you can actually explore the tunnel yourself. Beit She’an – This Biblical site dates back to the 6th century BCE and is home to beautiful and well-preserved Roman ruins including bathhouses a theater column-lined streets and much more. It was the Roman capital of northern Israel and is one of the largest archaeological sites in the world. Beit Guvrin-Maresha – Located in Beit Guvrin-Maresha National Park near Kiryat Gat this Roman ruin was known as Eleutheropolis during the Roman and Byzantine eras. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to a Jewish cemetery an amphitheater and a Byzantine church. You can also find the ruins of public baths and burial caves here as well. Herodium National Park – Located just outside of Jerusalem this fortress built into a hill rivals the more popular Masada yet sees a fraction of the visitors. Here you’ll find palatial ruins underground tunnels secret caves lookout points offering beautiful views and the famous tomb of Herod the Great. As for the more well-known Caesarea National Park it’s located just 30 minutes by car south of Haifa. As one of the country’s biggest archaeological sites it’s home to Roman Byzantine and Crusader cities. It’s famous for its Roman aqueduct hippodrome and amphitheater a great place to see a concert plus there is a public beach and shopping nearby. 9. Learn About Gaza and the West Bank Located on the southwest coast Gaza has a long past. In recent history the region has been controlled by the British Egyptians and Israelis and is currently ruled de facto by Hamas. Palestine-Israel relations are a sensitive topic — and I have no desire to get into that in this post — but understanding the conflict is vital to understanding the region and its history. While you can’t easily visit Gaza it’s just 71 km 44 miles from Tel Aviv and there are several border tours you can take to learn more about the ongoing conflict. Abraham Tours runs dual-narrative” tours of Gaza that offer insight into the complex history of the conflict they also run tours about the West Bank. Additionally Green Olive Tours a joint Israeli-Palestinian company offers tons of insightful single and multiday tours around Gaza and the West Bank as well. And these are some reputable NGOs that work in Gaza that you can reach out to Palestinian Circus School Medical Aid for Palestinians The Freedom Theatre 10. Haifa Haifa a relaxed port city on Mount Carmel in the north is another must-see destination. Home to just under 300000 people the city’s history stretches back to the third century CE. An important industrial hub Haifa boasts a mix of Muslim Jewish and Christian inhabitants which has helped it maintain a diverse and cosmopolitan feel. Haifa is also home to Israel’s only subway a single line with six stops You could easily spend a few days just seeing the highlights. Don’t miss the UNESCO World Heritage Baha’i Gardens in the city center a beautiful terraced garden that is home to the golden-domed Baha’i Shrine of the Báb. For an amazing view take the cable car up Mount Carmel to the Stella Maris Carmelite Monastery. The ride is just five minutes and costs 35 ILS $10 USD round-trip. You’ll be rewarded with a picture-perfect view of Haifa and the Mediterranean. You can also base yourself in Haifa while taking day trips to Nazareth Megiddo or other destinations in Galilee or along the coast. 11. Visit a Kibbutz A kibbutz is a collective community typically centered around a particular job or workplace. They started back in 1910 and were originally centered around collective agriculture. The concept spread rapidly and today there are still nearly 300 across the country. Many are open to visits from tourists who are looking for a more unique travel experience. Here are some of the most popular kibbutzim if you’re looking to learn more Kibbutz Ein Gev – Located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee this is one of the biggest kibbutzim in the country. It’s home to a beachside resort open to visitors as well as several agricultural operations including dairy farming and a banana plantation. Over 600 people live in the kibbutz and you can take a short train tour through it to learn more or book a stay at its holiday resort. The tours last 30 minutes and cost 16 ILS under $5 USD. Kibbutz Degania Alef – Established in 1910 this was Israel’s first kibbutz. It is home to over 500 people who all work in the community’s factories farms or service industries. There are also two small museums in the community that shed light on its history and development as well as some historical buildings you can visit to learn more you’ll need to book your museum visits in advance. Kibbutz Ein Gedi – Located on the Dead Sea this kibbutz is famous for its botanical garden which spans almost 25 acres and is home to over 900 species of plants. Founded in 1953 the kibbutz is home to just over 600 people and is focused on agriculture and tourism. Free tours are available daily in English and Hebrew. *** Whether you are interested in religious history are curious about archaeology or just want to spend time outdoors hiking diving and snorkeling you’ll find what you’re looking for in Israel. It’s truly a world-class destination for laid-back vacationers foodies and intrepid backpackers looking to get off the beaten trail. No matter what you’re looking for Israel won’t disappoint.

Absolutely the best trip we have taken to date. Such a beautiful and diverse landscape. The deserts in the south are beautiful and the northern mountains are gorgeous. We spent the entire trip staying with Abrham Hostels. They have three locations Tel Aviv Jerusalem and Nazarerth with a fourth coming Eilat. Each location offers tours and transit from one to the next. It was incredibly convenient not to have to worry about transport the entire time we were there. They had three full day tours in the West Bank which was awesome. Israel was somewhat surreal… there are just so many places that you’ve been hearing about your entire life from either sunday school or the news… getting to see them myself was an amazing experience. Reply Charlie March 7 2020 at 411 pm Hi Doug What was your budget? How did you make the arrangements with Abraham hostels? I t seems they provide transportation between cities? Israel travel has been a lifetime dream for me. Now with the corona virus seems even further away Reply Lookoom March 7 2020 at 931 pm Another great post. I felt the same overwhelming feeling when I spent two weeks in Israel I arrived with a long list of sites to visit I still have half of them to see yet. However it is necessary to be flexible as security measures can quickly make it impossible to access some places that happened to me. My strangest night was indeed the one spent in a kibbutz everything was silent and plunged into darkness. Reply Richard March 9 2020 at 1217 am Great pics and info.

It’s fast-paced futuristic and bursting with weird and wonderful activities to keep you busy including gorgeous shrines palaces and temples hip clubs and bars and fashionable people and shopping not to mention cherry blossoms. Tokyo lives up to all the hype you’ve heard about it. You never know what you’ll find here. One second you’ll run into a group of women dressed in pig masks and ’80s dresses and the next you’re in a robot café. Or a centuries-old temple. It’s also one of the biggest cities in the world home to over 13 million people — almost 40 million if you count the Greater Tokyo Area. It’s massive! Not surprisingly it’ll take some time to see it all. And there are so many nooks and crannies to explore that it’s easy to get lost.

Tokyo Itinerary Day 1 Visit the Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Market As of 2018 the main fish market moved to Toyosu. The new market is twice the size of Tsukiji making it the largest fish market in the world. Just make sure to get a visitor’s pass when you enter. Eat just-caught sushi for breakfast and marvel at the chaotic atmosphere at the world’s largest tuna market. The auction here powers much of the world’s sushi supply and it is truly breathtaking. All around you are fish with colors and shapes you didn’t know existed. I have never seen more seafood I couldn’t identify. The old outer market where you can find food and shops is still in the same location in Tsukiji. You can still head there to eat and look around but the main market is now in Toyosu. Tsukiji Fish Market 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji Chuo +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu Koto +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday from 5am-5pm though most shops don’t open until 7am. Admission is free. Relax in Ueno Park Ueno Park is a lovely spot to spend the day. It’s a perfect spot to photograph the many cherry trees and have a picnic. Don’t miss these sites in the park Tokyo National Museum – This museum is in the north end of the park. Established in 1872 this massive building houses one of the world’s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia particularly Japan. 13-9 Uenokoen Taito +81 3-3822-1111 tnm.jp.

Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum Built in 1933 this small museum used to be the official residence of the Prince and Princess Asaka. The prince had studied in Paris and wanted to bring the art deco style to Japan which explains the building’s style and decorations.

Stroll Along the Meguro River The Meguro River weaves almost five miles through the city and makes for a magnificent stroll.

Check out Asakusa If you want to check out some of Tokyo’s historic religious sites be sure to spend some time wandering around Asakusa. Two places that I’d suggest you visit are Senso-ji – This is Tokyo’s most popular and famous temple. It’s beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the beautiful Kaminari Gate. There’s a huge statue of Kannon the goddess of mercy inside the main hall. Look at the wooden wishes” cards hanging off to the side you can write your own and join the artistic display. It’s very busy during the day so maybe check out the grounds in the evening. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa Taito +81 3-3842-0181 senso-ji.jp. The grounds are open 24/7 though the temple itself is open daily 6am-5pm. Admission is free. Asakusa Shrine – Not far from Senso-ji is this Shinto shrine. This is much more peaceful than Senso-ji as there are fewer people and you’ll able to see people praying meditating or performing traditional rituals. It was built during the Edo period and survived the air raids of World War II. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa Taito +81 3-3844-1575 asakusajinja.jp. Open daily 9am-430pm. Admission is free. Have Dinner with Ninjas For a unique dining experience head to Ninja Akasaka a ninja-themed restaurant designed like an Edo-era building with waitstaff clothed in stereotypical all-black garb and trained in all sorts of tricks and illusions. You’ll order off old scrolls while being entertained by the skillful tricks of your server! It’s super fun. Tokyu Plaza Akasaka +81 3-5157-3936 ninjaakasaka.com. Open daily 5pm-1030pm 945pm on Sundays Drink in Golden Gai If you are looking for something interesting to do at night this alley of backstreet bars is a cool spot to start at. There isn’t much going on here during the day but come sundown these zigzag hallways and closet-sized beer rooms are filled with interesting people and cheap drinks. Tokyo Itinerary Day 2 Stop by the Imperial Palace The Imperial Palace home to the Emperor of Japan is a terrific spot to learn about Japan’s history and culture. Formerly Edo Castle it was built in the 15th century and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day. When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace. Though you can’t go inside or get super close the building is amazing. It is surrounded by beautiful grounds and a park and there’s a moat around the stone walls. You can also see the changing of the guard ceremony though it’s relatively low-key and unassuming. Admission to the grounds is free. Visit the National Art Center Opened in 2007 this museum and gallery doesn’t actually have a permanent collection but rather houses a never-ending series of temporary exhibitions from impressionism to modern art.

Stroll through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden This park is over 144 acres with some 20000 trees. Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II during the air raids but was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. During spring this beautiful park is one of the best spaces to see cherry blossoms. My favorite part is the Japanese landscape garden which has several ponds with bridges and islands. It’s a peaceful little oasis within the hustle and bustle of the city. 11 Naitomachi Shinjuku +81 3-3350-0151 env.go.jp/garden/shinjukugyoen/index.html. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-4pm.

This area is buzzing at night with bright lights and frenzied activity like Times Square on steroids. Make sure to visit the statue between Shibuya Station and the intersection it’s a tribute to Hachiko the loyal dog made famous in the film Hachi A Dog’s Tale. Eat at the Robot Restaurant This restaurant is an absolute sensory overload. Lasers robots monsters…it has it all!

Reply Hazel Joy April 29 2019 at 406 pm Tokyo looks like a daunting city but you have put together a list of things to do which seems pretty easy to follow. I’ve always wanted to go to Japan every since seeing Lost in Translation” and ever since hearing that the Okinawa lifestyle is one of the world’s healthiest. And dinner with ninjas? Hell yeah sign me up! Reply Rob May 7 2019 at 959 pm I lived in Japan recently for 6 months near Tokyo. And I have to say this is a very good itinerary. One can’t really do it all in a week but there are a lot of good suggestions here. One more to add would be the go-carts. You drive around Tokyo for an hour or two in go-carts and see a lot of the city. It’s fun. Just bring an international drivers license which is easy to get at AAA. Reply Eunice Tan February 22 2020 at 1228 am This is a great itinerary for getting the most out of your time in Tokyo! I’ve been to Tokyo several times now and haven’t done half the things on this list. Really makes me want to go back again.

It’s a celebration that brings people together to celebrate all the potential that a new year offers. It’s a day of hope and celebration. And it’s not too far away either! Soon people from around the world will be ringing in the new year soon with fireworks festivals friends parties and songs. It’s a fun holiday that knows no nationality. If you’re ready to stay up past your bedtime and indulge in the revelry here are my top ten best places to go for New Year’s Eve in 2019 1. New York City Times Square has been a focal point of New Year’s activity for more than a hundred years. Around one million people will crowd into the square to watch the famous ball drop. On top of that around a BILLION more people will watch from home making this one of the biggest events of the year — every year! If you want to watch the ball drop in person be sure to arrive early people start gathering in the afternoon to get a good spot and dress warmly! However there are lots of parties throughout the city and most New Yorkers try to aim for some of the downtown clubs and bars or a house party! Check out my free travel guide to New York City for more information on how to get there save money and enjoy the city during your visit! 2. Sydney Australia is one of the first countries in the world to experience New Year’s Eve making Sydney the first major city in the world to greet a new year sorry New Zealand you aren’t as big!. The city hosts one of the largest firework displays in the world. They last almost a full fifteen minutes and are best viewed from one of the boats in the harbor or surrounding hills. After the display the celebrations usually last until dawn. Locals love enjoying this day as it’s also in the middle of their summer so the weather is always great! Unsurprisingly accommodation disappears fast so be sure to book well in advance if you want to spend the New Year down under! Check out my free travel guide to Sydney for more information on how to get there save money and enjoy the city when you visit! 3. London London rings in the new year with an astonishing fireworks display that’s launched from the London Eye. The fireworks can be seen from rooftops and balconies all across London so you don’t need to leave your hotel to get a good view. If you want to get out there and really experience the display the best views are from Westminster Bridge and the north embankment of the River Thames opposite the London Eye. Check out my free travel guide to London for more information on what to see and do in London when you visit during the holiday! 4. Paris Paris is the perfect destination for a romantic New Year’s Eve getaway. It has high class dining clubbing fantastic fireworks and the chance to sip Champagne on the Champs-Elysees. Around midnight you can watch the Eiffel Tower’s light show. Another great place to spend the evening is Montmartre as it offers spectacular views of the entire Paris skyline. While you won’t get the same level of epic fireworks as you would in Sydney there are still great parties through the city and many people light off their own fireworks from the Champs-Elysees. The city stays open late! Check out my travel guide to Paris for more information on spending New Year’s in Paris! It includes things to do see costs and how to get around! 5. Ko Phangan Thailand Over 20000 young people cram on Haat Rin beach in Thailand to celebrate the New Year. Backpackers and travelers from around the world dance paint themselves up and drink buckets of alcohol from dusk until the first dawn of the new year. They fill the beach and it’s one of the wildest outdoor parties there is on New Year’s.

Check out my travel guide to Ko Phangan for more information including information on the famous Full Moon Party. 6. Kiribati What better way to ring in the New Year than to be the first person to do it? This spot in the Pacific is officially the first place in the world to see the New Year. It’s like going into the future! Tourism here has picked up in recent years as the locals have tried to capitalize on that interesting fact but the island remains mostly an untouched getaway. There’s not much to do here and accommodation isn’t by any means luxurious but what better way to spend the new year than on an island in the South Pacific? Be sure to plan this well in advance as few flights go here and limited accommodation makes its difficult to find spots. 7. Tokyo If a single night of partying isn’t enough for you head to Tokyo. The capital city of Japan starts celebrating on the 29th of December giving you a few extra days to let loose and give the year a proper send-off. Not only do they start early but the party almost doesn’t stop. New Year’s celebrations here continue until January 4th. While most of the major tourist sites in the city are closed during this time the streets of Tokyo as well as all restaurants and clubs are packed with locals and visitors alike. The city offers up numerous fireworks displays dancing and all the karaoke you can sing! Check out my travel guide to Tokyo for more information on what to do see and ways to save money. 8. Las Vegas The city that parties every night throughout the year certainly knows how to throw a New Year’s Eve bash to remember. There are so many clubs hotels bars and casinos to choose from in Las Vegas Nevada that it’s almost impossible to not celebrate in style. Outdoors The Strip” is closed to traffic so everyone can watch the grand fireworks displays high above the city’s neon lights. If you want to wade through the crowds make your way downtown to Fremont Street and join the massive block party complete with confetti a massive wine toast concerts by big-name rockers and a five-block-long illuminated canopy 90 feet overhead on which state-of-the-art sound and light shows are shown. Check out my travel guide to Las Vegas for more information on enjoying life in Sin City without spending a sinful amount of money. 9. San Juan Del Sur This holiday hotspot in Central America is a surfing and beach mecca for travelers of all ages and styles. During New Years the city is bursting with tourists and locals who come from the surrounding area to enjoy time on the beach with their families and party hard Nicaraguans sure know how to have fun!. This is definitely a place to go if you’re looking to get bit crazy and then nurse your hangover on the beach the next day. There’s usually a giant beach party where locals and tourists mingle dance drink and countdown a new year together! 10. Edinburgh When it comes to New Year’s Eve celebrations Edinburgh is one of those places that can’t be beat. Their Hogmanay is one of the most fun parties I’ve ever been too. Each year over 100000 people take part in the two-day celebration that involves a Viking procession fireworks over the castle bonfires concerts and a carnival. It’s out of this world fun. It gets super crowded and you’ll need tickets to the shows so be sure to book in advance. You can even walk the viking procession to the bonfire!

No matter where you are in the world this holiday is about celebrating with friends and family. Wherever they are will be the best place to celebrate. Who wants to spend such a great day with strangers? Paris London New York a jungle the beach your home — it doesn’t matter.

Thanks for writing this and thanks for the incredible pictures. Reply Celine December 31 2008 at 854 am Hi Matt I’ve enjoyed – or endured the freezing cold of – a New Year’s Eve at Times Square a few years back. It was crazy but incredibly exciting. Dropped in to wish you a happy New Year and may 2009 bring in peace joy and life’s best to you. Happy Travels. Reply Linda December 31 2008 at 910 am Great list though I’m not impressed at the dig at New Zealand we have cities of over a million people! Well we have one. I’m surprised you didn’t include Edinburgh – it’s regarded by many as THE place to be at New Year’s or Hogmanay as they call it in Scotland. There’s a huge party and fantastic fireworks not to mention heaps of guys wandering around in kilts. Reply Linda December 31 2008 at 913 am Juan I think Prague is better for Christmas.

Reply Kerry January 1 2010 at 948 am It doesn’t really surprise me that many would claim their cities and country as the first funny though that New Zealand has the first major cities in the world that greet the New Year it may not be as BIG as Australia since you believe over population to be a criteria for being bestowed this honour but us Kiwis love our lush open spaces and striking scenic beauty so feel free to claim the New Year as being your first! we here in NZ know who get’s to welcome it in first and are happy to stand aside have a beer and laugh at the rest of the wannabes!!!

Reply Steve Gordon October 27 2011 at 814 am I am from the U.S. and I’ve been to NYC and L.V. nice list btw but I’m suprised the Rio de Janeiro didn’t make the list! If you are into travel you have got to experience it. Reply Nidhin November 18 2011 at 847 am I was wanting to go a different place other than goaIndia for this NYE…. From what I have heard Sri-Lanka is a great place to party and at the same time it will not pinch your wallets 🙂 For those of you’ll wanting to try out new places than the aforementioned my suggestion would strongly be Goa or Sri-Lanka. Reply Helen December 14 2016 at 147 am Edinburgh really is the home of NYE celebrations. Scotland loves NYE so much there is even a special name for it Hogmanay! London doesn’t come close to the street parties in Edinburgh. If you haven’t been to Edinburgh for Hogmanay Matt then I suggest that could be a plan for next year! Reply Helen December 14 2016 at 342 am Matt I just read the post about your visit to Hogmanay 2014. It is a great reflection of the vibrancy of this event. Glad you got a chance to experience it. Having moved from Scotland to Australia I will miss Hogmanay but I am looking forward to going to Sydney for NYE at some point. Reply Owen Lloyd November 21 2018 at 644 am I’ll be in Ljubljana I believe this New Year hope it’ll be great! Love the post man great content as usual.

I know that everybody is proposing a place I thought of adding Athens celebrating NYE in Acropolis is quite something! Reply Oscar Brumel November 25 2018 at 1246 pm Wow Thanks for the tip about Edinburgh! I’ve been there countless times and I had no idea that they like to put up a show on the new years eve. Might go there this year who knows! The tickets are always cheap to Scotland from where I live. Aside from that I wanted to thank you for your book on how to travel the world for 50$ a day. Last month I completed it and I must say that it was an awesome read. Reply Pete Rojwongsuriya November 27 2018 at 1106 pm For me it’s definitely being back home in Bangkok where the weather is much cooler now excellent for doing outdoor activities which is not easy to do in a place like Bangkok and best of all the city is empty because all the locals go to either the north or the south to celebrate which means it is the only time of year Bangkok is free of the dreaded traffic! The quiet empty Bangkok is the best. 🙂 Reply Mark Gwilliam December 6 2018 at 833 pm Ouch…as a Kiwi Auckland surely warrants being called a major city! 🙂 Apart from that I loved your post Matt. I’m looking forward to being first to see 2019 from Auckland’s beautiful harbour and waterfront! Reply Oliver October 9 2019 at 629 pm Hi Matt. My wife and I really want to celebrate the New Year in Paris. But I didn’t fully understand everything will work on holidays? And what about booking how early do you need to book everything? Thanks for the answer. Reply Tommy Berg December 27 2019 at 144 am Wow I totally missed Edinburgh. The medieval styled old town people and culture… I should plan a trip next year with my wife to re-live the moments again. 🙂 Reply Robert Harris April 22 2020 at 215 am Great article Matt! New York is definitely one of the best places to spend your New Year’s Eve! Apart from the ball drop at Times Sqaure the fireworks at the Central Park and at the Grand Army Plaza are also amazing.

But it’s also surrounded by stunning landscapes with both the ocean and the mountains within easy reach. It’s known for being a laid-back eclectic city — and an expensive one too. Since Seattle can be a little pricey budget travelers will likely want to stay in a hostel. Even with the prevalence of Airbnb hostels in Seattle are still the cheapest form of accommodation — and they’re usually perfect for meeting other travelers too. That said there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Seattle are Location – Seattle is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Seattle you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Seattle that I like the most Price Legend per night $ = Under $30 USD $$ = $30-40 USD $$$ = Over $40 USD 1. Green Tortoise Seattle Hostel This is my favorite hostel in Seattle. The dorm beds have privacy curtains and there are enough outlets to charge everything you might bring. The rooms aren’t very large though and the luggage storage is under the bottom bunk so if you’re sleeping there and your bunkmate needs something you’ll definitely hear it. You’ll also hear music and people late at night given its central location so bring earplugs. That said the bathrooms here really set this hostel apart from others they have rainfall showerheads and heated tile floors. The hostel also provides free breakfast complete with eggs cereal fruit and bread. There is a communal kitchen and common room with foosball and other games. They also run free walking tours and pub crawls and even host weekly ice cream socials! Green Tortoise is located across the street from the iconic Pike Place Market as well as the first-ever Starbucks. It’s also not far from other well-known sites like the Great Wheel and the Crocodile a bar famous for its live music — Nirvana Pearl Jam and other famous bands have played here. If you want the best hostel experience in the city stay here. Green Tortoise at a Glance $$ Great place to meet other travelers Privacy curtains so you’ll get a decent sleep Free breakfast Beds from $35 USD rooms from $98 USD a night —> Book your stay at Green Tortoise Seattle Hostel! 2. HI Seattle at the American Hotel The HI Seattle at the American Hotel offers same-sex dorm rooms there are no co-ed dorms here with shared bathrooms as well as private rooms some with en suite bathrooms. Rooms here are basic but the beds are comfortable. The kitchen is the best thing about the hostel as it’s large and perfect for cooking your own meals there’s also an international grocery store a quick walk away. Free continental breakfast is included though it’s nothing fancy. The hostel is only minutes away from both the BoltBus and Amtrak stations and its location in Chinatown/International District means there are lots of affordable restaurants nearby. It’s also close to historic Pioneer Square which is home to tons of hip coffee shops art galleries and restaurants as well as the Pinball Museum Smith Tower the oldest skyscraper in the city the ferry terminal and the Underground City. It’s just over a mile from Pike Place Market too.

It has a small kitchen and a basic free continental breakfast both of which can help lower your budget if you plan on cooking your own meals. There is no common room though so it’s not super easy to meet people. Also there is a limited number of bathrooms and showers so sometimes you may have to wait to get in. It’s located in the quirky neighborhood of Fremont where you’ll find the Fremont Troll a massive statue underneath the Aurora Bridge as well as a year-round Sunday market offering antiques art and food trucks. HotelHotel Hostel at a Glance $$ Laid-back and quiet atmosphere Lots of cool markets and food trucks nearby Free breakfast Beds from $30 USD rooms from $89 USD a night —> Book your stay at HotelHotel Hostel! 4. City Hostel If you like art you’ll love City Hostel as its 40+ rooms were recently redesigned renovated and repainted by local artists. Most rooms have squeaky bunk beds and some rooms can get loud because of the bars and clubs nearby but everything is quite clean. Free breakfast is included and there’s an outdoor patio and BBQ a communal kitchen a fireplace and a 20-seat theater too. It’s a great place for being social and meeting people. City Hostel is a 10-minute walk to Pike Place Market and nearby attractions like the Space Needle .

As I’ve come to learn — and as any traveler will tell you — things don’t always go as planned. You just never know what will happen. Sure nine times out of ten you’ll be completely fine. But every now and then you’ll stumble into an unfortunate situation. Maybe it’s just a missed flight or a delayed connection. Maybe your wallet disappears while riding a crowded bus. Maybe like me you burst an eardrum while scuba diving. Bad things unfortunately do happen when you travel. And they can get really expensive if you’re injured or fall sick abroad and are not insured. But what about if you’re taking a cruise — how does travel insurance work then? Well of course you still need travel insurance if you’re on a cruise but there are some extra things you’ll want to be aware of. 7 Things to Look for in a Cruise Travel Insurance Policy 1. Make sure that whichever travel insurance policy you choose you double-check that it’s valid for any emergency and problem that might arise on a cruise specifically. Often cruise coverage is an extra charge on top of your regular travel insurance. 2. Even if you’re cruising close to home you may still run into unforeseen issues. For example in the United States medical insurance stops covering you when your ship is more than six hours away from a US port in Australia it stops as soon as your ship leaves port. For that reason you’ll want to get a policy that covers you even if you’re in/around your home country. 3. Be aware that the treatment for less serious medical conditions — the kinds that don’t require you to leave the trip — are more expensive on a cruise ship than on land. Make sure your policy has a sufficient amount of medical coverage of at least $100000 USD. 4. Remember if you fall seriously ill when you’re at sea and you need to be evacuated to a hospital it’s more expensive than if you’re already on land. Evacuation by helicopter to the nearest treatment facility can be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Make sure your policy has sufficient evacuation coverage. If you don’t want to get stuck in that nearest” hospital consider getting Medjet. They are the premier membership program that then gets you all the way to a hospital at home. 5. Be sure to have cancellation delay or trip interruption coverage too. For example if you have a flight delay that means you’ll miss the start of the cruise it’s a lot more difficult to deal with than just arriving late for a land-based trip. Hurricanes or other severe weather events also affect cruises significantly and you’ll want your insurance policy to take that into account. 6. Take a look at the shore activities you might participate in during the cruise and check if any need to be mentioned to your insurer like certain adventure activities or water sports. 7. Unlike other kinds of travel you might be more likely to take valuable jewelry and expensive clothing on a cruise for some of the fancy dinners and events cruise ships hold. Often a regular travel insurance policy will only cover these items up to a certain value so check that your belongings are covered against possible loss or theft. What is the Best Cruise Travel Insurance? With so much to consider it can be hard to decide which cruise travel insurance to choose. Be aware that while many cruise companies offer their own insurance the conditions are often stricter and you might find it hard to make a claim. For example they often will only reimburse up to 75% of your expenses tend to have only a short list of reasons you are able to cancel for and rarely cover pre-existing medical conditions. You’re always better off using a third-party insurer. Whichever policy you decide on it’s vital that you read the policy details carefully so you know exactly what you are covered for. The insurers below are some I recommend that have specific cruise insurance policies and offer a decent amount of coverage for a lot of potential mishaps. Travel Guard Travel Guard has specific cruise insurance policies which makes it simpler than trying to find an add-on. If you’re getting a quote online they’ll ask you to specify if you’re taking a plane a cruise or both. They cover any emergency travel assistance trip interruption delay or cancellation. Medical expenses and emergency evacuation are covered but the maximum amount varies between the essential preferred and deluxe plans the essential plan includes a $150000 limit on emergency evacuation which might not be quite enough from some parts of the world but you can get up to a million dollars of coverage on the deluxe plan. VisitorsCoverage/IMG In early 2019 VisitorsCoverage and IMG partnered to launch a new insurance product specifically for cruise travelers called SafeCruise. The SafeCruise plan includes all the extra protection you need as a cruise traveler and even has an upgrade option to include coverage of up to 75% of prepaid nonrefundable costs if you cancel for any reason at all. The emergency evacuation or medical repatriation coverage has a high limit of $1000000. Additionally as long as you purchase insurance by the time you make your final trip payment there’s a waiver for most pre-existing conditions too. Insure My Trip Insure My Trip is an unbiased aggregator site that will look at many different insurance policies to find the one that best fits your needs. For example if your cruise is during hurricane season to an area that might be affected its search algorithm takes that into account and recommends travel insurance policies with good coverage for weather problems. *** Don’t go on a cruise without proper travel insurance. However you need to be aware that for a cruise you have to pay a bit more attention than usual to the conditions of the policy. Make sure that any policy you choose covers you sufficiently for medical evacuation medical treatment onboard and other mishaps like missed connections stolen luggage delays and cancellations. If you can’t afford to add cruise travel insurance on to the costs of your trip you probably can’t afford to travel. It’s just not worth the risk of coming home with a bill in the tens of thousands of dollars or more if something unexpected goes wrong. In my experience it’s always better to be safe than sorry. The peace of mind is worth the extra cost. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the largest inventory.

It’s a city home to hippies techies artists immigrants students and everyone in between. There’s incredible music wold-class food for all budgets some of the BEST Asian food in the country parks galore and amazing bohemian vibe to it. With so many diverse influences it’s no surprise that San Francisco has evolved into a world-class city that has a ton of amazing things to see and do. Personally I love visiting San Francisco for the food. It’s home to some of the best Asian and Mexican food in the country as well as some incredible cafes. But there is also much more to see here too. And just because it’s an expensive place to live doesn’t mean a visit has to break the bank either. To help you plan your trip here are the best 28 things to see and do in San Francisco 1. Take a Free Walking Tour The first thing I do whenever I arrive in a new destination is to take a walking tour. It’s the best way to get the lay of the land see the highlights and ask your questions to an expert local guide. Free Tours By Foot has a few different FREE options available covering different areas of the city. Just make sure to tip your guide If you want something more in-depth there are also plenty of paid tours you can take. Take Walks is my go-to walking tour company and they offer some interesting tours around the city. If you want to really learn a lot while having fun book a tour with them! 2. Walk the Golden Gate Bridge There is no question that the iconic Golden Gate Bridge is one of San Francisco’s most famous landmarks. Opened in 1937 it’s arguably the most-photographed bridge in the world. At its inception it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world spanning 4200 feet 1280m long and standing 746 feet 227m tall. You can walk across the bridge which I recommended or just stare at it from every angle and snap your own iconic photos. If you have time make your way to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It has a waterfront promenade sweeping views of the bridge and a few easy hiking trails. 3. Visit Crissy Field This park is located near the bridge and makes for a nice follow-up. It has a beach some restaurants piers where you can see locals fishing and plenty of green space to relax. It offers some sweeping views of the harbor making it a laid-back place to come in the summer to have a picnic lounge in the sun and watch life go by. 4. See The Palace of Fine Arts The Palace of Fine Arts is a Roman-style remnant of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition a world’s fair held in San Francisco. The outdoor rotunda and its lagoon are another one of the city’s most photographed sights. It’s also a fun social destination where you can bring friends to play giant Jenga cornhole ping pong and other games. The city often has events here. 601 Lyon Street +1 415-608-2220 palaceoffinearts.com. Open Tuesday-Sunday from 10am-5pm. Admission is free some events charge admission. 5. Wander Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39 The wharf was originally dominated by Italian immigrants who helped popularize the city’s fish market. To this day you can watch fishermen at work in Fish Alley the main street where the fishermen work. If you want to try some of the mouthwatering seafood that San Francisco is famous for I sugged Waterbar and the Anchor Oyster Bar. Pier 39 is touristy but it’s also a fun way to spend an hour or so. There are buskers tacky souvenir shops arcades an aquarium and tons of overpriced restaurants so avoid eating here. 6. Explore Alcatraz Alcatraz is probably the most famous or infamous prison in America. From 1934-1963 it housed the country’s most notorious criminals criminals like Al Capone. In its 29 year history not a single prisoner successfully escaped or so they say. After its closure it became a national landmark. Visitors can explore the island learn about the prison and what life was like as an inmate and tour the interior. It gets very busy in the summer so be sure to book ahead. +1 415-981-7625 alcatrazcruises.com. Tours run daily year-round and cost $39.90 USD which includes an audio tour. 7. Take a Day Trip to Berkeley Located just 20 minutes across the bay by car Berkeley is home to music hippies students and the University of California – Berkeley 30% of the city’s population go to school here. You can take a tour of the campus self-guided or guided hike up the Berkeley Hills or shop on Fourth Street the main thoroughfare. You’ll also find lots of vegan and vegetarian restaurants street performers and eclectic shops to browse. 8. Hang out in the Mission For an amazing view of the city head to Dolores Park in the Mission District. If you’re a history buff don’t miss the Misión San Francisco de Asís Mission Dolores. Founded in 1776 it’s the oldest surviving structure in the city and home to the only cemetery within city limits. It’s the structure that gives this part of town its name. The Mission District is also a fun place to spend a night out. The district has tons of great Mexican restaurants as well as lively bars and clubs. Grab a burrito at Taqueria Cancún or Papolete or visit one of the cocktail bars on 16th Dalva is good. 9. See Lombard Street This is the world’s windiest street. Surrounded by gardens and flowers it’s made up of eight hairpin turns because during the 1920s people in San Francisco were beginning to drive around in automobiles. However many of the city’s famous hills were too steep to navigate. The idea of using a curved street to help vehicles move downhill was embraced and the hill’s slope went from 27% to 16%. Now you can watch the cars and bikers navigate the sharp turns as tourists gawk at them. 10. Visit Coit Tower Perched atop Telegraph Hill this art deco tower was built in 1933. Standing 180-feet tall 55m it’s home to over 25 murals and offers a panoramic view of the city. The murals here were painted in 1934 by local artists and depict life in San Francisco during the Depression. The tower became a San Francisco Designated Landmark in 1984 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. 1 Telegraph Hill Blvd +1 315-249-0995sfrecpark.org/destination/telegraph-hill-pioneer-park/coit-tower.

Eat in Chinatown This is the biggest Chinatown in the United States and it’s the second most famous after New York City. Chinese immigrants first came to the West Coast in the 1850s and set up shop in San Francisco. Due to racial segregation this neighborhood became predominantly Chinese and remained so even after segregation ended. It’s one of the best places in the city to eat and you can find some incredible dim sum here. There are also lots of great teahouses bars souvenir stalls and fortune cookie makers. To really learn about the area its history and its people take a walking tour with Take Walks. They’re my go-to walking tour company because they use expert local guides and their tours are always fun and educational. 12. Ride the Cable Cars No visit to San Francisco is complete without riding on a cable car. The cable car system in San Francisco is the last manually-operated system in the entire world. Of the 22 lines that were originally created in the 19th century only three are still in operation. Since there is limited seating and since they are one of the biggest tourist attractions in the city waits can be long. Make sure you plan ahead try to go during a weekday when there are fewer visitors. Tickets are $7 USD. 13. Go on a Harbor Tour For a completely different look at the city take an afternoon cruise of San Francisco Bay. You’ll get to see some wildlife snap some great photos and learn about the bay and its place in San Francisco’s history. Around 40% of California drains into the bay and the area is home to all kinds of snakes rays otters sharks whales sea lions and more.

Posted 02/06/20 | February 6th 2020 At the end of 2019 the team and I ran a reader survey. We wanted to see what you liked didn’t like and wanted from us in the future. There were some interesting and helpful suggestions in there. I read through over a thousand responses as I wanted to see what you wanted from us. You can’t get better without feedback and we always want to make sure we’re serving your needs. So as we make our way through this year I wanted to share with you some changes you can expect to see on the website First we’re continuing to bring on new voices to write for us. You might have noticed that we’re having more guest posts to more destinations! We’re currently looking for articles about LGBT content stories by transgender people queer couples and solo gay lesbian or bi travelers Africa-related content bonus points if it’s East or Central Africa Middle East–related content Central Asia–related content India-related content China-related content Technology- or gear-related content Senior/Older travel Family travel If you want to write for us check out our guidelines page. Second I plan to write more travel stories this year. We do a lot of brass-tacks hard-numbers stuff here. The nuts and bolts of travel. Practical information. But last year writing my book inspired me to get into more storytelling. So this year as I make my way around the world I’m making an effort to create more stories about the places I visit — their history people and culture. So you’ll see such content popping up with more frequency. And you’ll see more history and culture in our how-to posts too. I want to start painting a more holistic view of each destination we write about. Third we’re going to be hosting a lot more events this year. We’ve started The Nomadic Network so we can do more in-person events this year. We really want to take this online community offline so we’re building a great website for that and hosting lots of events. For more information and ways you can get involved check this post out. Fourth a lot of you suggested topics you wanted to see so we’re busy making that happen! Some of the topics you’ll start to see more of over the course of the year are Eco-travel Traveling with pets Family/kid-friendly travel Traveling when you’re older How to make friends when you travel How to make the most of your time How to save more money BEFORE you go Off-beat destinations Thematic” ways to see a city Reader stories Ways to volunteer Itinerary posts And a bunch more! Obviously I can’t write all the time or expertly on all these topics which is why we’re going to be bringing in a few more regular contributors and writers now. So not only will you be seeing more content you’ll be seeing a lot more diverse voices on the website too. And as a sidebar to that since we have so much content now we’re going to be doing a new redesign in the middle of the year so the site will be easier to navigate. That’s it! Those are our big plans! We’re super excited about what’s in store for this year. – Matt Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

He had just returned from an overland drive from New York City to Patagonia. After I peppered him with questions about his trip I mean really how cool does that trip sound? he asked me one How do you deal with coming home staying in the travel mindset and keeping the lessons you learned alive?” It’s a great question and it touches on something a lot of travelers get blindsided by the post-travel blues. Post-trip depression is something many long-term travelers struggle with. Coming home is often harder than leaving or adjusting to life abroad because it’s so anticlimactic. Before your trip there is this massive buildup of emotions preparation and excitement. You’ve been planning your trip for months imagining yourself trekking through foreign lands meeting interesting people and going on an adventure. You’re moving toward a goal. You’re excited. A bright future of possibility lies before you. But then you come home after months or years abroad and it’s suddenly now what?” There’s no more buildup. Just a complete stop. You don’t come back with a bang you come back with a whimper. Your friends are only kind of interested in your trip but soon their eyes glaze over at your travel tales. Before you know it you fall back into your old routine and it’s as if the trip never happened. So what can you do to re-create that sense of travel when you get back home? And given the times we live in what do you do when you are quarantined because of coronavirus flights are grounded and the travel industry has come to a halt? How can you keep that sense of adventure alive while you are home literally in your home and generally in your community? Well here are 7 ways to bring the world to you when you can’t go to it 1.

You meet with the student regularly to show them local places share a holiday meal or just go out for coffee. It’s great for families and a good alternative to having people actually stay in your home. Reply Jess January 12 2017 at 223 pm Eat With is definitely one of my favorites! We could use more programs like this. Reply TF January 12 2017 at 347 pm You’d be surprised how many smaller cities have international/exotic pockets. The nursing home where my dad was in hospice was a mini United Nations. The medical workers were from Ghana Cameroon DRC Kenya Nepal Peru Philippines Pakistan cleaning help from Latin America….This in a mid-size Midwestern city. Talking to them brought out their stories as well as tips about where to find ethnic restaurants. Reply PB January 12 2017 at 557 pm We’re actually working on that! Not everyone can travel and even those that are able to can’t do it all the time. Reply Stephanie January 12 2017 at 851 pm Great suggestions! I notice that I’m much more open” while traveling and it’s hard to keep that mindset when I’m back in the daily grind. Meeting other travelers – or doing things I typically only do while traveling – helps. I’m a huge fan of Meetups! I belonged to several when I lived in Washington DC. Now my husband and I are living in Japan and I started my own French conversation group. It’s not only a great way to meet other French speakers but it gives me a channel to make Japanese friends. Reply Alex Webb January 13 2017 at 834 pm Great article. I particularly like the suggestion of bringing the world to you with couch surfing. Wanting to see the world was a big reason why I left my hometown after high school and moved to Hong Kong for university. It really opened up the world to me and introduced me to many new experiences that I couldn’t have had otherwise. I also was able to meet many new friends that I wouldn’t know otherwise. It really changed my life. Now that I’m back in the States I’ve gotta say that I agree–post travel depression is real and it can feel tough to acclimate back to normal life” in the culture you grew up in. I think your advice in this regard trying to meet new people from different cultures etc. is really true. The world would be a much better place if more people were more open and willing to listen to people from different cultures. We’re more similar than we may seem and learning about other ways of doing things and seeing the world is so important especially given debates about immigration going on around the world. Reply Kenny January 14 2017 at 1157 am Music is another great way to bring the world to you. Find music from the area you want to visit and it mentally transports you. Along that vein I am the organizer for a World Music Meetup here in Boston and we have a blast getting a taste of the world in our own backyard via music. When you do travel get a CD from the local scene and you have a great souvenir to remind yourself of that area when you return home. Reply Joe January 15 2017 at 946 am There’s a sense of this is boring” once you return home. CouchSurfing though is a great way to change that melancholy into excitement! My favorite host in Raleigh NC of all places brought me to another CouchSurfer’s house warming party! Three couples myself and a girl whose boyfriend was away… But I was no 8th wheel! They were all so inviting cooked amazing food… I enjoyed myself very much. The CS community is pretty dandy! Reply NomadicMatt January 15 2017 at 957 am This is a perfect example of why I love Couchsurfing! Reply Natalie January 15 2017 at 1010 am This is such a great article. I couldn’t travel much last year but I actually did kind of bring the world to me. I made several friends who are originally from Japan and one from Chile. Though going to evening meet ups and gatherings is really not an option because I have toddlers. However I am adventurous in meeting people talking to those who also have kids in particular. I highly recommend saying hi to people and seeing what happens. Reply Arianwen January 15 2017 at 136 pm Some great tips here! I definitely got post-trip depression after 10 months in Asia last year. I went from having all the independence I could wish for to living back at home with my dad for half a year while a visa application in relation to an amazing job opportunity overseas failed! It feels good to be on the road again and doing Meetups etc again. Reply Hurghada January 16 2017 at 145 am Music is another great way to bring the world to you.

I definitely struggle with after travel depression on a regular basis and love to surround myself with like-minded people at home. I also still attend university and enjoy spending time with exchange students learning their language or teaching them German. It’s also a nice way to invite the world into your home 🙂 Reply Caren January 19 2017 at 839 am I also love listening to Podcasts and just the other day I found there was a Laos Buddhist monastery in the small Appalachian town I’m living in right now! They also run a super authentic restaurant and it’s like being back in Southeast Asia all over again. I loved this article because I really hate coming home after a trip but there’s tons of ways to make it better! Reply Jennifer January 19 2017 at 1230 pm Post- travel depression is so real. I’m experiencing it now. Funny this post came up during my reverse culture-shock” state of mind. Thanks Matt for sharing Reply Deepika May 15 2017 at 739 am I agree with you NomadicMatt coming home is often harder than leaving for a travel person. But I never thought about it this way. I will definitely try these. Many of us often say I wish I could travel more but I don’t have the money.” Or sometimes the issue isn’t money but time. Or energy. Or children. You have the best advice for these problems. Reply Hope August 22 2017 at 1134 pm This is such a great article. I couldn’t travel much last year but I actually did kind of bring the world to me.

Reply Allison March 18 2020 at 240 am I’m glad everyone is writing articles like this for all of us who can’t scratch our travel itch! But I would not recommend that Woody Allen film there are a million other films set in and about Paris that aren’t directed by a person like him. Reply Renuka Walter March 18 2020 at 509 am I like the fact that you mentioned about reading travel blogs. This is a challenging time for all of us. Let’s hope to get on the other side soon. I’m spending my time writing learning new things and just praying. I hope this time is going to make all of us a lot humbler. Reply Charelle March 21 2020 at 903 am Thanks Matt really helpful now we can’t travel. Luckily I also have your blogging course to keep me busy at the moment. Hopefully times will get better soon and I hope you will feel better soon as well! Reply Sher March 26 2020 at 158 pm As an aspiring traveler but keeping a full-time job scratching that itch has been a skill I had to master. I teach in a University International Relations so I have a natural love affair with maps but I sometimes find myself pinning destinations I want to visit next! Watching travel shows also help. Up in the Air was something we were asked to watched in grad school and I never looked back when I started to love flying. And yes I think I have watched almost every single episode of Anthony Bourdain’s shows!

It’s an important topic I can’t adequately cover so I brought in an expert to share her advice for other women travelers to help cover the topics important and specific to them! In this month’s article she explores the double standards that come with solo female travel. I rushed to the gate at Julius Nyerere Airport in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. As the agent checked my passport he looked around me and perplexed asked if I was alone. I’d just finished up four months of solo traveling up from South Africa one of the best and most enriching solo trips of my life and replied that yes I was alone. Your husband lets you do that?” he asked incredulously. I get it. In Tanzania it’s unthinkable for a woman especially in her late twenties like I was to travel alone. I gently let him know that nobody lets” me do anything and that I’m unmarried. While I take pleasure in shifting paradigms when possible I still wonder what it would be like if I were a man. How would I be perceived when I solo travel or write about it? How would people treat me differently? 1. They wouldn’t ask me whether or not my husband lets me” travel alone. From Tanzania to the Philippines I’ve been asked where my boyfriend or husband is. I bet almost nobody would ask me if my girlfriend lets me travel alone if I were a man. I wouldn’t have to question whether or not I should lie about being single. I wouldn’t debate wearing a decoy wedding band. My safety wouldn’t be tied up in my singleness. 2. They wouldn’t question whether a boyfriend or daddy pays for my trips. Is it so strange to believe that a woman can fund her own lifestyle? Why is there such a pervasive myth that women who travel solo are being bankrolled by someone? When I travel I pay for it and when I travel with my partner we split it 50/50. I bet I wouldn’t have to state that if I were a man though. 3. People might ask when I’m planning to settle down but they wouldn’t do it with such frequency and entitlement to the answer Maybe settling down with a white picket fence 2.5 kids and a dog named Spike used to be the norm but we have more mobility these days and the internet and too many people anyway. So why is it so darn important to people that I eventually settle down? I think in a way it’s saying Hey this was the only option I gave myself and now you have to follow suit.” For those who conform to expectations it’s uncomfortable when others deviate from the norm especially women. But I’m not worried about it. If and when I choose I’ll do it and if I don’t that’s OK too. I’m approaching this more like a man OK? Also get out of my ovaries. 4. I’d be called adventurous and an explorer rather than irresponsible and stupid. If I traveled solo as a man even if something unfortunate happened to me I’d be called an explorer and lover of life. Yet as a woman I’ve been called stupid warned I’d be found dead and cannibalized” and accused of leading other women to their death just look at the comments on this video the worst of which I actually deleted. 5. I wouldn’t be warned I’d get raped” if I traveled alone. If I were a man I’d only have a 6.6% chance of being told I’d get raped” if I travel alone versus nearly 70% as a woman. This is problematic on so many levels it deserves its own post. 6. I’d be able to wear what I want. In some places I can’t wear what I want. I understand that modesty is built into the culture in many places around the world and I respect it and assimilate when in those countries. But that doesn’t mean I have to pretend that I enjoy wearing long sleeves and pants in 90-degree weather with 90% humidity while the boys get to wear shorts and tank tops. 7. I wouldn’t have had to wonder what the hell to do when cornered in an elevator in Santiago by two big men saying salacious things to me in Spanish. When I traveled through Patagonia with a male friend nobody harassed me assuming I wasn’t available. Yet when we parted ways so that I could solo travel — something that was important to me to do — the catcalls started pouring in. Sadly I’ve been catcalled in almost every country that I’ve been to even the ones you’d least expect yet not at all in southern and eastern Africa — points for Africa!. It ranges from ciao bella” to being chased down the sidewalk. It is not a compliment it’s an assertion of power and it’s exhausting. In Santiago it crossed the line into terrifying when two huge guys got into an elevator with me hovered over me and harassed me. It was the perfect place because who could help me in there? Would that have happened to a man? On the positive side if I were a man locals might not be as concerned with taking care of me as many are. People might also not trust me outright the way they do. Right or wrong women tend to be perceived as more peaceful and gentle and in need of protection. 8. Nobody would have assaulted me in public in Nepal. In Pokhara Nepal after a random power cut the sun was setting and I realized I needed water to drink to get through the evening. Though I prefer not to walk alone when it gets dark I had to do so in that instance. I heard myself scream before realizing that a local male had grabbed my breast. I whirled around and saw nothing but the back of his head as he ran away like the coward he is. Everyone nearby just pretended like they hadn’t seen anything of course. 9. But maybe the police would have taken me more seriously. I wonder if I’d been a man demanding the police take notice would they have listened to me? Would the officer still have rolled his eyes and acted like I was ruining his night by demanding an escort back to my guesthouse? I can only wonder if it would have been different. 10. Insulting my ass would not be the topic of discussion on a post about road trips. When women share about something like travel on social media why is body shaming still a thing? Why on a post about road trips of all things does someone feel the need to inform me that my ass is flat? Does that happen to guys too? I think not. 11. I wouldn’t have had an internet stalker demand a naked selfie from me for months on all of my social platforms. If being a solo female traveler is tough at times try writing about it. Have any of my male peers ever been harassed for months on end on every platform by a stalker demanding a naked selfie? Unfortunately women are targeted online way more than men. According to the BBC one in three teenage girls have been sexually harassed online. Why can’t we just share our travel pictures in peace? 12. I wouldn’t get a flood of comments from fragile males on posts like this. It always happens but I’m curious Why should any egalitarian male who has the ability to see things from someone else’s perspective ever take this personally? Why does pointing out issues in our society automatically equate to blaming men? Louder for the ones in the back it doesn’t. *** Obviously there are drawbacks for male solo travelers too — and benefits that only women who travel solo get to enjoy. There can be an implied trust factor between women that transcends cultures and time and time again people have been generous towards me in ways that I didn’t expect. In the end I still love and champion solo female travel and believe that every woman should do it. I’m just sick of all the double standards and think it’s high time to call them out. Kristin Addis is a solo female travel expert who inspires women to travel the world in an authentic and adventurous way. A former investment banker who sold all of her belongings and left California in 2012 Kristin has solo traveled the world for over eight years covering every continent except for Antarctica but it’s on her list. There’s almost nothing she won’t try and almost nowhere she won’t explore. You can find more of her musings at Be My Travel Muse or on Instagram and Facebook.

No idea if men get asked this. Reply Lynna February 20 2020 at 613 pm And it doesn’t stop as you get older. Now when I tell them my husband isn’t with me because I am a widow I am asked about my sons not my daughters. Reply kristin addis February 21 2020 at 1213 pm Gosh that’s so annoying! Reply Kathleen February 21 2020 at 132 am I couldn’t agree more with all of this – especially the comments about your dad must be rich!” your dad lets you do this?!” I’m 34 years old thanks. No one bankrolls me or lets me do anything – I just do what I want to do because I’m an independent adult! It’s a weird infantilisation. Reply kristin addis February 21 2020 at 1213 pm Yeah.. maybe I’m rich or just thrifty. Maybe I’m self-made. That’s an option! Reply Mike February 21 2020 at 950 am You raised some really good points and respectfully so. I’ve seen it all travelling with my wife. When I’m 10 feet away and out of view it makes my stomach curdle to see how she is treated. When she’s dealing with immigration to leave the Phillipines her home country –she hears almost everything you mentioned in one conversation plus sometimes getting hit on. And then she points to the white guy and suddenly all is well. My instinct is to defend her but she won’t have it. So many countries are like this travelling with an ex from Thailand to Singapore they questioned her for 20 minutes to ensure she wasn’t a prostitute. Which means they thought I was a trafficker. Made my heart hurt. Women are higher value than men in most cultures. It comes with a price tag and ugly ignorance. On the flip side I appreciate the culture of where my lady is from warts and all for who my wife became because of it. Because of it she understands there are monsters everywhere. Tourism is a party no one is really invited to some people express bad vibes immediately once they sense you’re a tourist regardless of gender although it manifests in different ways. Women get the worst treatment. These same challenges we decry make some of us strong. They probably made you strong –albeit frustrated and rightly so. But they made you better for it. Glass half full not saying any of this is acceptable but the benefit is that you’re likely much tougher and street smart than you were when you started out and that’s useful for the rest of your life. As a guy living in Asia for 10 years I too can relate to these problems. But I know this isn’t the time to bring it up. I’m not told over and over that these things can happen to me I don’t get d-bag warnings like you but the things they warn you of have literally happened to me. Even the stuff that doesn’t normally happen to most men. Awful stuff. No confessions for this comment but I think you know what I’m saying. But what really got me in the heart strings was that you also said this Obviously there are drawbacks for male solo travelers too — and benefits that only women who travel solo get to enjoy. There can be an implied trust factor between women that transcends cultures and time and time again people have been generous towards me in ways that I didn’t expect.” I understand women truly do get the shorter end of the stick in global travel –but most articles shut down the male perspective immediately or blame them for all woes you didn’t do that. Thanks for writing such a thoughtful article and not putting all men down. All in all I am left with the feeling that you’re a better writer than I and you’re able to empathise with men at a time when they need it too while articulating what you mean without adding popular rhetoric. In one way or another we’re all up against hundreds of thousands of years of culture and biology. It’s not one society it’s many societies and each have their differences. It’s amazing to me that present day America can exist at the same time as present day Saudi Arabia. I hope that mention gets linked to Matt’s article on influencer marketing for Saudi Arabia. To wrap it up –although I’m not a woke” person I am aware empathetic and I do what I can to bring about a correction” to the woes you listed here. Thanks for making an article I can really stand behind Kristin as a man. Well expressed and a true reality for solo female travellers. A lesson and a warning. Reply Steven February 23 2020 at 500 am Yes men sometimes get asked about kids when travelling. It happened to me yesterday in Morocco. And there have been times when because I said I wasn’t married I’m in my 40s it was assumed that I was gay. And that was in France! But no question women have it rougher in Islamic countries not done Asia or South America yet. And not just wandering women. The locals seem to have it just as bad. Reply Lia February 23 2020 at 457 pm Are you kidding me. This western perspective irks me. You get in Tanzania for a day and now you know how Tanzania women are allowed to do or not do. I’m Tanzanian and it’s not unheard of single girls travelling alone. People are people they are curious when they see something that doesn’t fit the norm. Even in America I have been asked where is your boyfriend. This kind of narrative tries to subconsciously portray developing countries as if they are stuck and legging behind. Reply Mika March 4 2020 at 1120 am I too have experienced the same comments about Where is your husband/boyfriend?”. In one country this young girl asked me my age I believe she was curious how I afforded to travel solo. Even in a group of three young females in Italy we were treated differently when we traveled with a male v when we were just three young females. Many males don’t understand the challenges single solo travelers face. Thank you for sharing and educating others. Reply Christine March 4 2020 at 251 pm That’s why I believe that more women from a variety of cultures and backgrounds need to travel independently. Exposure can over time change sexist ideas about how women move through the world. It can also empower others to see someone like themselves traveling independently.

New year new you” starts with the best intentions but after a couple of months it’s back to new year old you. Old habits die hard but they can be broken if they are replaced with good ones. We’re at the start of a new year and decade so — as someone who loves a good cliché — I’m going to use this time to build the habits that create a better version of me. After many years of trying and writing copious and annoying blog posts about it last year I finally slowed my travels and moved to Austin. I have a furnished apartment plants only two have died so far! and a recently purchased car my first ever!. My days are filled with routine. I wake up make breakfast head to WeWork go to the gym head home read cook dinner read some more and go to bed. My life is the proverbial suburban 9-to-5 I tried to escape from for so many years. And for the first January in years I’m not on the road. I’ve been enjoying it so much I’ve even begun to dread heading to the airport the same way children dread the dentist. I used to think routine was a bad thing. It was the thing that killed spontaneity and adventure. But I’ve come to learn that routine actually creates the framework for excitement and adventure. By scheduling my days and following a routine I can ensure that I make time for what’s important and for all the things I want to do and goals I hope to accomplish. So I wrote a list of things to do this year called Stop Being Boring” with all the things I want to do while in Austin this year get out more volunteer attend city council meetings first one is next month! join some social clubs to meet new people host more meet-ups and explore more of the city. Now that I have a car I also plan to see more of Texas and the American South. Rather than try to read more I’m going to be a reader. Rather than try to go to the gym I’m going to be the person that does. While I’ve already made some good strides toward eating better and going to the gym the true test will be when I start traveling in February. Will I fall back into old habits? Maybe. But I’m motivated to break them. This year is also going to be all about focus for me. I want to focus on work without getting sidetracked by phone calls or Facebook so I can end my workday earlier. The internet makes it easy to stretch it from four productive hours to ten unproductive ones especially when you work for yourself. Now I’m already sitting undistracted from my tasks and getting them done quicker! Next month I’m going to Hawaii and Taiwan for three weeks before heading back to Paris and Berlin. In the summer when the weather in Austin is too unbearable I’m thinking about the Balkans and maybe some of the ’Stans in the fall. And then in November I’d like to finally get to Peru. And while I’ll travel less this year what trips I do take will be done with more focus. As they say what’s old is new again and this year I’m going to travel without my computer again. Last year all my travels were just a backdrop for work — and that’s not how I want to see the world. *** Study after study has shown that by imagining yourself as your desired self you unconsciously start acting like that person. I’m determined to make new year new me” last the full year. And if I don’t you’re free to remind me of this post and hold me accountable! So that’s what I’ve been up to these last few quiet months. What are your goals for the new year? Book Your Trip to Austin Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.

Reply Amy M January 23 2020 at 1136 am It’s definitely easier to keep yourself accountable weekly/monthly than it is yearly. My last resolution was to finish the things I’d started I have about three books that I’ve started writing and I got about halfway through it. This year’s resolution is to continue with that and finish the remainder whilst *trying* not to start any other lengthy stuff! Best of luck with achieving yours.

I love this. I’m also someone who dreads the mundane things of life. However I have resolved to enjoy all the mundane things and small things of everyday life. I have come to realize that following a routine every day makes your life more rewarding and much more exciting in the long run. Reply Veronika Primm January 24 2020 at 1108 am That sounds exciting Matt. So you’re going to do most of the out-of-routine activities on weekends? I enjoy having a nice routine too while escaping the harsh European winter to a Thai island 🙂 Life’s good and I’m so much more productive! Fingers crossed that you kick a** this year! See you maybe on one of the many blogger conferences I’m not going to TBEX or ITB this year though. Reply NomadicMatt January 24 2020 at 357 pm Come to TravelCon! That’s our baby! Reply Emilia Cruickshank January 24 2020 at 1000 pm Hey Matt Something made me pick up your book in the library the other day and I’m so glad I did’ Love it! Love you! Can’t wait to hit the road again. Cheers Emilia Reply Allison January 28 2020 at 416 pm I love to travel but I also really like routine! Which is why when I was reading your book I was like ‘I want to do that!’ but I also really like having a steady paycheck and I own my apartment and have two cats so that’s kinda keeping me in one place NYC so it’s not so bad . Your book DID make me want to find some way to take a month or two and travel at some point though! I did right after college for a month. Reply Jesse Larson February 15 2020 at 623 pm Oh man I loved reading this. I traveled nearly non-stop for 8 or so years and had no home base. Now I’m in a relationship with a guy who goes to school and works in Santa Fe NM. This is the first time in YEARS that I’ve actually had a place to call home and I have to say I really love it! I still travel as often as I can of course. Since my boyfriend loves to travel too we have been taking off for the entire summer and then doing as many mini-trips throughout the rest of the year as possible. But when we are home it feels so good to be able to get into little routines and actually have a gym membership and be able to cook my own dinner every night! I’m so excited and curious to see how you end up liking Austin which is a place I’ve always wanted to go to but never made it to and hear more about how you’re creating the right balance between travel and home life!

Posted 2/2/2020 | February 2nd 2020 Bangkok can be an overwhelming destination for tourists and it is depicted in many Western films as seedy gritty and intense with wild nightlife and never-ending traffic. Most visitors don’t stay there for long but if you’re patient and begin to peel back the layers you’ll discover a complex beautiful city filled with some of the friendliest and most thoughtful people you will ever meet Thailand is called the Land of Smiles for a reason! and delicious street food. But is Bangkok a safe place to visit? Just like any major city you must be alert and aware of your surroundings but it is pretty safe and the risk of serious danger is very low unless you are up to something illegal. You are most likely to encounter small scams designed to get a few extra bucks from you more on that later. Here are a few ways to stay extra safe in Bangkok 1. Be alert as a pedestrian. Traffic in Bangkok is chaotic — many motorbikes will run red lights or even drive on the sidewalks! — so it’s always a good idea to be cautious when crossing the streets and walking around town. Look both ways and stay alert. And remember they drive on the left side of the road British side so be sure to look and stay alert! 2. Carry a photocopy of your passport with you. This is a no-brainer for anyone who travels overseas. Put your real passport away in the lockbox provided by your hotel or hostel and carry around a photocopy or a digital version on your phone or in your email. 3. Never leave your drink unattended. This is another universal safety tip. Drinks can be spiked at any moment so always keep yours close or hand it to someone you trust if you need to. 4. Do not take or accept any recreational drugs. Thailand has a strict no-drugs policy anyone caught using or carrying illegal substances will go to jail or in rare instances receive the death penalty. 5. Don’t talk about the royal family. Under the lèse majesté law you are forbidden to speak negatively of the king and the royal family. If you are caught insulting the monarchy you will be sentenced to 3–15 years in prison. Other countries may have lèse majesté laws but Thailand’s enforcement is the world’s harshest. Over the years people have faced lèse majesté charges over minor offenses a woman who wore black on the king’s birthday a man who mocked the king’s dog on the internet and individuals who have liked Facebook posts regarding the king to name a few. It’s crucial you not discuss the king or royal family publicly or with locals or you will face major consequences that all the travel insurance in the world will not protect you from! 6. Buy travel insurance. No one wants to think about things going wrong on their trip but being prepared and buying travel insurance is something I do before every trip. You should have it whenever you travel but in a country where petty theft and scams are unfortunately a little more common it’s extra important. And of course it’s also important for covering any medical or other emergency situation you might encounter. Be a smart traveler — buy travel insurance. We recommend World Nomads for travelers under 70 while Insure My Trip is the best choice for travelers over 70. For more information on tarvel insurance check out these posts What Does Travel Insurance ACTUALLY Cover? The 7 Best Travel Companies in 2019 How to Buy the Best Travel Insurance How to Avoid Scams in Bangkok Bangkok is generally safe for travelers and backpackers but it’s also incredibly hectic. Petty theft including bag snatching is the most common type of crime you’ll face. Also some people will try to rip you off including taxi drivers who refuse to turn on their meters. Avoiding travel scams requires a lot of common sense and a healthy dose of suspicion. Also read this post on travel scams to avoid. Here are the two most common scams to be aware of Taxi scams You hop into a taxi and realize the meter isn’t running. You mention this to the driver and their response is that the meter is broken” and he quotes you a price that is outrageously high. Or you might notice that the meter is working but the fare is increasing as fast as a bullet train in Japan. To avoid this scam do your research and get an idea of how much a ride should cost from your hostel or hotel staff before hailing a taxi. In my experience if the cabbie tries to negotiate the rate I use the one quoted to me though my prior research and if he refuses I get out and find someone who will turn the meter on. Ideally use only taxis with working meters. If the meter looks as though it’s rising unusually fast ask the driver to pull over and get out immediately. Another situation you may encounter is your taxi driver taking the scenic route.” You’ll end up sitting in traffic and the cabbie will make money at your expense. We live in the age of technology so if you’re suspicious of your driver’s route pull your smartphone out and use Google Maps to find the quickest way to your destination. Better yet find out the optimum route ahead of time. Don’t hesitate to show the phone to your driver and insist on taking this route. Download a map of the city using Google Maps or MAPS.ME so you always have access to it offline. If you end up with a bad taxi experience take a photo of the driver’s ID/registration number and report him to Thailand’s tourism board. And always always use only official taxis. The tourist site is closed”/tuk-tuk ride scam This is probably the most common scam in Bangkok. When visiting tourist attractions often around Wat Phra Kaew the Grand Palace or Wat Arun someone will randomly come up to you and say that the place is closed for a special ceremony or for lunch hour. Then this overly helpful individual will offer to take you to places that are open. While touring the attractions the driver will take you to a gem shop a souvenir shop or a tailor where they receive a commission. A few hours later the driver will drop you off at your original location once it’s reopened” and by that time you’ve realized that the site was open the entire time — you were just in the wrong part of the building. This is where your good sense and confidence come into play. Avoid talking to these locals or firmly say no thanks” and walk away. Or find the main entrance or ticket counter and see for yourself! Another thing to note is that most attractions don’t close for lunch — they close for the day. Look up the hours of operation before you go so you know what to expect — opening and closing times are almost always available online. FAQ on Bangkok Safety Below is a list of some of the common questions I get on safety in Bangkok so you can be better prepared for your trip! Is street food safe? Yes absolutely! Bangkok is considered the street food capital of the world and you will not find a shortage of stalls selling delicious local dishes on every corner. With that said if there is something that doesn’t smell or look kosher” then it might be best to avoid. If a street vendor has local customers you can usually trust that it’s safe. If you are overwhelmed with where to start I’d recommend reading this blog post on how to tackle the street food culture in Bangkok. Is the tap water safe? According to the Bangkok Metropolitan Waterworks Authority it follows the World Health Organization standards for providing safe drinking water for the population. However although the water is treated in plants the pipes it travels through can be very old and dirty which can lead to contamination. Locals usually boil the tap water first before drinking it or they will purchase bottled water. Use a Steripen or Lifestraw to ensure that your water is safe to drink. Also bring a reusable water bottle to cut down on your plastic consumption. Are taxis safe? Taxis are safe and affordable and my preferred way to get around town. However you will come across the occasional meter or scenic route” scam. When you get into a cab always check that it has a working meter and agree on a route prior to the start of your journey. If you’ve read the section on taxi scams above you will be well prepared for this type of situation. Is Bangkok safe for solo travelers? Bangkok is safe for solo travelers and a great first city to solo-travel in. I’ve been going there for the past 15 years and have rarely encountered any problems. However there are areas of Bangkok that are all about partying and drinking and the biggest incidents happen when people are drunk and stupid. Don’t get too drunk. Also avoid illegal substances at all cost — Thailand is very very strict on drugs and you’re going to be screwed if you get caught. Always trust your gut instinct if you don’t do it at home don’t do it when you’re in Bangkok. Is Bangkok safe for solo female travelers? Solo female travelers should feel safe touring the city. It’s very easy to meet other travelers especially female ones in Bangkok. Some precautions and planning are in order though Always have a downloaded map and translation app so you can find your way home or ask for help if you need it. Don’t flaunt any valuables and avoid taking taxis alone at night. If you’re still nervous about heading somewhere ask to join a group at your hostel groups are less likely to be victims of scammers or theft and you’ll feel safer that way. Here are a few helpful posts on safety written by our solo female travel experts How to Stay Safe as a Solo Female Traveler 8 Myths About Solo Female Travel Debunked 10 Common Questions About Solo Female Travel *** Bangkok has an electric energy to it and with its endless supply of things to see and do you will never be bored. I finally began to love the city when I got know it beyond the temples and the typical tourist sites. Once I found hidden markets and amazing street stalls frequented only by locals became friends with residents and understood how Bangkok operated I understood why people loved it so much. Like any major city Bangkok comes with its fair share of scammers and unruly drivers. If you are smart and alert trust your instincts and follow this safety guide you’ll have an unforgettable experience while staying safe. Get the In-Depth Budget Guide to Bangkok!

The dorm beds are actually cubbies built into the wall for added privacy and each room sleeps eight people. This is a great hostel if you want some peace and quiet.

He was really polite though.

Asks where I was from and surprise he has a relative that is going to school in my home town Vancouver. Gives me his tel. # and asks me to drop by for some drinks later was on to him however as this is a familiar scam used in several major cities. Once you show up a drug will be put in your drink and more than likely you will be withdrawing cash from an ATM. 🙂 Try to drop by BKK for a few days explore a new area if not too tired before heading to my NE Thai home.

With its picturesque historic Old Town that dates back to the 13th century it has been drawing in tourists since the fall of the Soviet Union. Cheap flights cheap prices and the beauty of Prague without the crowds have made Tallinn an appealing weekend getaway for Europeans. I visited the city on a trip from Finland — there’s a frequent ferry service between the two cities — and was enamored by it. It was a blend of Nordic and Baltic culture with plenty of things to see and do. Best of all it was super affordable! Though the city has become a bit more crowded and expensive in the last couple of years it’s still one of my favorite places in the region. It’s peaceful and wonderful the people are open and relaxed and the country is super tech-forward they offer e-residency services specifically for digital nomads. To help you make the most out of your trip here are the best things to see and do in Tallinn — from the super touristy to off the beaten trail! 1.

Unfortunately most of the castle was looted during World War I so none of the unique pieces of furniture he created remain. However you’ll still get to see the statues he built on the grounds of the park. There’s also an observatory tower and palm house which has a gorgeous mosaic rooftop. It’s a good place to relax go for a walk or go skiing during wintertime. Vana-Mustamäe 48 +372 652 5076 ttu.ee/organisatsioonid/glehni-loss.

What makes it unlike most other churches is that coats-of-arms epitaphs hang on the walls of the church instead of more traditional religious artwork or decorations. Historically these were used as headstones for people of importance such as nobles and knights. They reflect the people of status who were buried on the grounds. In fact the first man who ever led a Russian voyage around the world Admiral Adam Johan von Krusenstern is buried here. Climb the 69-meter 226-foot bell tower to get a beautiful view of the city. Toom-Koolitänav 6 +372 644 4140. Open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–330pm closed Mondays. Admission is 5 EUR for adults and 3 EUR for children. Dress respectfully as this is a place of worship. 9.

Its galleries now feature drawings from the 1920s as well as over 11500 archived items such as drawings and sketches and some 18000 items in their photo collection.

TV Tower Adrenaline junkies will get a kick out of visiting the TV Tower. Not only will you have an incredible bird’s-eye view of Tallinn from the top which stands 314 meters 1030 feet tall but you can also try the Walk on the Edge experience. Hop into a harness and step outside of the tower onto the exposed deck. It’s the highest open deck in Northern Europe and offers both an amazing view and a huge rush! The TV Tower was constructed when Tallinn was chosen as a host city for sailing during the 1980 Moscow Olympics. It closed in 2007 for renovations and reopened in 2012. It has floor-to-ceiling windows not ideal if you’re afraid of heights so you can really soak in the view as well as touch-screen information panels so you can learn about the tower and the city.

Telliskivi Creative City The Telliskivi Creative City is a workplace for over a thousand people with artist’s studios a radio station rehearsal spaces and NGO offices all situated throughout ten repurposed factory buildings. Telleskivi hosts a flea market every Saturday and there are over 600 cultural events throughout the year including dance performances music concerts and improv theatre. There are colorful murals on many of the buildings and you’ll also find restaurants and bars full of locals and tourists alike. Make sure you eat at Peatus Stop” in Estonian for a really unique experience it’s located inside two old Soviet railcars and the food is great too!. Telliskivi tänav 60a Pohja Tallinna linnaosa. 12. Bastion Tunnels These tunnels were initially built in the 17th century as an addition to the Kiek in de Kök Peek in the Kitchen tower and were intended for storage. They later held prisoners and then were used as shelters against air raids during World War II. In more modern history thieves and rebels used them for shelter since the police usually avoided the tunnels. They were cleaned out and opened up to the public in 2004. If you’re brave enough you can explore the winding maze of the dark damp tunnels on a guided tour when you visit the tower. Komandandi tee 2 +372 644 6686 linnamuuseum.ee/kiek-de-kok. Open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–5pm Thursday until 8pm closed Monday. Admission is 14 EUR. 13. Toompea Castle & Alexander Nevsky Cathedral Toompea Castle dates all the way back to the 9th century and is currently used by Riigikogu Estonia’s Parliament. The east wing has a brightly colored pink and white exterior in baroque style as ordered by Empress Catherine the Great in 1773. The opposing side still has its medieval stone exterior. The Estonian flag is raised above the tower at sunrise every day. You can also visit the nearby Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.

Soviet Statue Graveyard The Soviet Statue Graveyard located near Maarjamäe Castle contains a collection of discarded statues such as those of Joseph Stalin Vladimir Lenin and Mikhail Kalinin. After the Soviets left Tallinn they were dumped here and ignored. You’ll find large statues of heads a classic Soviet statue trend and others that tower over three meters ten feet tall. It’s a surreal place to visit — especially when you realize it hasn’t even been 30 years since Estonia achieved independence and these statues were left to fade into history. Pirita tee 56 10127 ajaloomuuseum.ee/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/noukogude-aegsete-monumentide-valinaitus. Open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–6pm closed Monday. 15. KGB Museum Rooms previously used by spies during the Soviet era sit on the top floor of the stylish Hotel Viru located on Viru Square. They house listening and recording equipment some cleverly disguised dial telephones uniforms and a typewriter. Few people ever knew these rooms existed and they were only exposed in the 1990s when the KGB fled the city. They shed light on just how controlling and subversive the Soviet government was during the occupation. Viru väljak 4 +372 680 9300 viru.ee/en. Open daily from 10am–5pm.

I can highly recommend a couple more things 1 The Pirita Convent is just a 15 minute bus ride outside the city. It is a really massive cool medieval ruin. The entrance fee is not expensive and wandering around was very peaceful. 2 If possible try out a local sauna. Estonian sauna culture is similar to Finnish sauna culture. I found one in the Kalamaja neighborhood. 3 ROST Bakery still stands out in my memory as being exceptional even 2 years later. Reply Mo March 19 2020 at 728 am It is a superb list!

It’s the capital of Japan and home to a wide array of fun historic and quirky attractions. From the world’s largest tuna auction and the Imperial Palace to robot restaurants and vampire cafés Tokyo really does have something for everyone. Whether you’re here for a short stopover or living here as an expat you’ll be able to find plenty of ways to pass the time and get a feel for the organized chaos that is Tokyo. To help you make the most out of your trip here are the best things to see and do in Tokyo 1. Visit the Fish Market The Tsukiji Fish Market was one of the most iconic staples of the city. In 2018 the market moved to Toyosu and is now twice the size of the original Tsukiji market. In fact the new market is the largest fish market in the entire world. While you’ll need a visitor’s pass to enter you can get one on arrival the pass is free which means you’ll have more money to spend on sushi! There are over 600 vendors here selling fresh fish as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. Gorge on sushi and marvel at the chaotic atmosphere of the world’s largest tuna market. The tuna auction here powers much of the world’s sushi supply and it is truly a sight to be seen. You can also see a model of the largest tuna ever sold at Tsujiki — which weighed 500kg 1100lbs!. In addition to the new market the old outer market at Tsukiji still has plenty of restaurants and shops. You can still head there to eat and look around though all the action is now at Toyosu. Be sure to arrive early to beat the crowds especially on Saturdays. Tsukiji Fish Market 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji Chuo +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu Koto +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday from 5am-5pm though most shops don’t open until 7am. Admission is free. 2. Explore by the Imperial Palace The Imperial Palace is the official home of the Emperor of Japan. It’s a terrific spot to learn about Japan’s history and culture. Formerly Edo Castle the palace was built in the 15th century and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day. When the Emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it the Imperial Palace. You can’t go inside or even get super close however the building itself is both regal and serene and a great place to relax or snap some photos. The palace is surrounded by beautiful grounds and a park and there’s a moat around the massive stone walls. Admission to the grounds is free. 3. Experience a Tea Ceremony No visit to Japan is complete without experiencing a traditional tea ceremony. Tea was brought to Japan in the 9th century by a Buddhist monk and by the 12th century the ceremony began to take shape. While these ceremonies are usually long not to mention expensive there are plenty of budget-friendly options for anyone looking to experience one without breaking the bank. Here are a few budget-friednly tea ceremonies in Tokyo worth checking out Kyoto-kan 500 JPY per person Yanmar Tokyo Building 1F 2-1-1 Nadeshiko 2700-4400 JPY per person 2-7-24-2F Asakusa The Way of Tea 5500 JPY per person Coredo Muromachi 3 3F 4. Relax in Ueno Park Ueno Park is a relaxing and beautiful spot to relax for a few hours or an entire day if you’re not in a rush. It’s a serene spot to photograph the many cherry trees that line the park which blossom in April and are a huge tourist draw or to have a picnic on a sunny summer afternoon. There are also a few important things to see in the park as well. Here are a few sights in the park you should make time to visit Tokyo National Museum – Established in 1872 this museum is located in the north end of the park and houses one of the world’s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia particularly Japan. 13-9 Uenokoen Taito +81 3-3822-1111 tnm.jp. Open daily 930am-5pm 8pm on most Fridays. Admission is 620 JPY. Tosho-gu Shrine – This is a 17th-century Shinto shrine with stunning gold doors and ornate carvings. 9-88 Uenokoen Taito +81 3-3822-3455 uenotoshogu.com/en. Open daily 9am-530pm. Admission is free though to go further into the shrine you’ll have to pay 500 JPY. National Museum of Western Art – Opened in 1959 this is one of the only art galleries in the country to focus on Western art. The collection is comprised of 5000 pieces dating from the Renaissance all the way to the 20th century. There are works by Van Gogh Monet Renoir and Picasso as well as sculptures dating back to the 14th century.7-7 Uenokoen +81 3-3828-5131  nmwa.go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 930am-530pm 8pm on Fridays. Admission is 500 JPY for adults 250 for college students and free for seniors and anyone under 18. 5. Eat at the Robot Restaurant This restaurant literally called Robot Restaurant is an absolute sensory overload. it has lasers robots monsters music dancing and much much more! Sure it may be a bit of a tourist trap aka it’s not cheap but it is an epic dining experience unlike anything you’ve ever seen. It’s definitely worth the price if you want to do something completely out of the ordinary — and something decidedly Japanese. 1 Chome-7-1 Kabukicho +81 3-3200-5500 shinjuku-robot.com/pc. There are three performances a day on weekdays starting at 445pm with afternoon matinees on weekends. 6. Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum This small museum used to be the official residence of the Prince and Princess Asaka. Built in 1933 the building itself was influenced by the art deco movement in Paris. The prince had studied in Paris and wanted to bring the art deco style to Japan hence the building’s style and decorations. In 1983 the residence transitioned into a museum and is now home to a rotating series of modern art exhibitions. See their website for information on what exhibits are available. 5-21-9 Shirokanedai +81 3-3443-0201 teien-art-museum.ne.jp/en. Open daily 10am-6pm. Admission is 200 JPY with discounts available for students children and seniors. 7. Stroll Along the Meguro River The Meguro River weaves almost five miles through the city and makes for a magnificent stroll. There’s a path with a bit of green space that follows the water so plenty of locals walk or exercise there. In the spring you’ll be able to see a lot of cherry blossoms as you walk along the banks of the river as well. While the walk is nice at any time of year late March to early April is when the cherry blossoms will be in bloom. While there will be a lot of people then cherry blossom viewing is a national pastime you’ll be rewarded with some beautiful scenery in the heart of the metropolis. 8. Check out Asakusa If you want to check out some of Tokyo’s historic and culturally-significant religious sites be sure to spend some time wandering around Asakusa. Two places that I’d suggest you visit are Senso-ji – This is Tokyo’s most popular and arguably most famous temple. It’s beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the Kaminari Gate. There’s a huge statue of Kannon the goddess of mercy inside the main hall. It’s busy during the day so aim to visit in the evening to beat the crowds. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa Taito +81 3-3842-0181 senso-ji.jp.

The dog is something of a national icon in Japan and the story was made famous by the film Hachi A Dog’s Tale. 17.

The statue was initially constructed within a temple but the temple was washed away — on several occasions — by storms. Today the statue now sits in the open air along with a massive pair of straw sandals that belong to the statue.

Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II however it was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. During spring the park is one of the best spaces to see cherry blossoms.

Admission is 900 JPY for the main deck or 1600 JPY for the top. 28. Visit the Samurai Museum No trip to Japan would be complete without learning about samurai.

Drinks at the Park Hyatt New York Bar is the iconic bar from Sofia Coppola’s 2003 film Lost in Translation. Located on the 52nd floor the bar actually lives up to the hype of the film. The atmosphere is classy the drinks are great and the view is absolutely stunning.

I always liked London but it wasn’t until I spent a few weeks there last summer that I fell in love with London. I didn’t want to leave. London is a sprawling city covering 607 square miles and home to over eight million people. While the city may be expensive though like any big city it has lots of free things to do there it’s popularity means there are lots of hostels in the city. Hundreds upon hundreds. I’ve been visiting London for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in London are Location – London is huge and while the metro does go everywhere it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In London you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free or cheap breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

Like most of their hostels Generator London has lots of modern upscale fixtures a huge common area a bar and a restaurant no common kitchen though. There’s also a pool and foosball table. The beds are plush but there are not many charging plugs in the walls so you’ll have to fight for space.

There’s a huge downstairs kitchen/bar area where you can work eat socialize and drink. They host a lot of unique events like solo traveler meet-ups and DJ + Bingo nights. The dorms are kind of cramped that eight bed really should of been a six bed but they have curtains on the side individual lights and outlets and lockers. Bathrooms are super clean too. I really liked this hostel. It’s one of the better ones in London.

Astor Hyde Park This hostel is in a quiet neighborhood right off Hyde Park and within walking distance to some of London’s best museums like the Natural History Museum and the Victoria & Albert. There’s a great party vibe and the friendly hotel staff will help you arrange tours and activities. Plus the 1 GBP breakfast can’t be beat! I love the old wooden décor of the building as you feel more like you’re in a home than a hostel. The dorms are huge and there’s plenty of room to sprawl out. Try to avoid the rooms on the upper floors as the hostel has no elevator.

Wombats City Hostel London The Wombats City Hostel is located in a beautiful refurbished building that used to be a sailor’s hostel. This led to the current décor and the wooden bunk beds that are unfortunately a bit squeaky. The rooms are a nice size and there are activities planned most nights of the week like walking tours and karaoke. The hostel’s central location is one of its best features – it’s super close to London’s main attractions like the Tower Bridge the Tower of London and City Hall. It’s got a good vibe to meet people in but it could use a kitchen!

It’s not as quaint as their Hyde Park branch but I find this location better!

St. Christopher’s Village This hostel chain has eight London locations but I like the Village venue the best — especially for being so near the Borough Market an absolute haven for foodies. It’s also a short walk to the London Eye and Tower Bridge. This is a pretty big party place with an outdoor terrace regular beer pong nights and musical performances. There are a ton of social events to get you well acquainted with your fellow travelers! It’s the first hostel in London to have cozy pod-style beds.

The interior has traditional English décor in the lobby area including a decorative knight in shining armor. The beds are comfortable and have privacy curtains. There is an elevator but the top floors can get hot in the summer so I’d avoid them. Though it is small the kitchen has everything you need and the downstairs bar is great to sit and have a beer. I’m a huge fan.

YHA London YHA has six London locations but the Earls Court and Oxford Street locations are my favorite. These hostels both have dorms and private rooms. The rooms are typically very clean and safe and both locations host activities every week including free walking tours and movie nights. The Earls Court location is in a recently refurbished Victorian building. The Oxford Street location is colorful and cheerful but not great for families as it does get pretty loud in the evenings.

Just read that article and landed here then for my London accommodation. Great list of cool places The Dictionary looks awesome! When did you stay there? The swing seems fun Reply Keith Lutz February 21 2019 at 601 pm I’m single male and old well I’m 66 now but I was 63 when I stayed at The Walrus in London for 5 nights. My bed was in a 10 bed mixed dorm on the top floor that should have only had 8 beds. Six of the bunks were occupied by tiny Korean girls whose rolling cases were bigger than them and took up a lot of floor space. I was there during World Cup Rugby week so the rest of my roommates could be rather boisterous at times. I suspect that my presence as the ‘old man’ in the bottom bunk may have served as a calming influence on occasion. The pub downstairs was a lot of fun with good beer and good natured banter between rival rugby fans.

I spent a month there on my first trip around the world in 2006. I made friends wandered far and wide and really got to know the city and its people. In fact I fell in love with Amsterdam that trip and I’ve been back to visit Amsterdam every year since. It’s one of the most visited and backpacked cities in Europe. And so it’s filled with hundreds of hostels hotels and guesthouses. With so many places showing up in your search results how do you know which are the best hostels in Amsterdam? I mean dozens are top rated” on Hostelworld right? I’ve been visiting Amsterdam for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places over the years. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Amsterdam are Location – Amsterdam is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Amsterdam you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

Little known nerd fact My parents took my friend Matt and me to NYC because we won a free trip for placing first me and second him in the Massachusetts state championship of the card game Magic The Gathering. Yes you read that correctly! As you probably know NYC is one of the best foodie cities in the world — you can find cuisines from every ethnicity here. And from dollar pizza slices to expensive $400 USD meals at Per Se it also has food to cover all price ranges. Because of the variety and quality of food here I rarely cook at home kitchens are small and there’s better food everywhere! and so over the years I’ve developed a robust list of recommended restaurants that I want to share with you now. My 25 Favorite Restaurants in NYC 1. Corner Bistro 331 W. 4th Street World-famous for its thick and greasy hamburgers I think this is one of the best burger joints in the city. This tiny dimly lit bar is definitely not the restaurant you would expect to find such mouthwatering food. I bet they haven’t cleaned the grill in ages which makes the burgers have such an amazing taste. I’m sure the drinks here are good too but I only ever come for the burger. 2. The Fat Radish 17 Orchard Street With some of the best farm-to-table organic food in the entire city the menu here changes based on seasonality offers lots of vegetarian options and will leave you full and feeling healthy. 3. Hot Kitchen 104 Second Avenue Delicious fiery Szechuan food at a great price. This isn’t the place to get General Tso’s. It’s the real deal. Try the tripe pig’s intestine – it’s delicious! Be warned though the food here is really spicy! Since I’m a wimp when it comes to spicy food my stomach still suffers the day after I eat there but if you love fiery food or are willing to suffer the consequences don’t miss this place. 4. Jeffrey’s Grocery 172 Waverly Place Located in the West Village this is not a cheap meal most mains are $20 USD but they pour heavy heavy glasses of wine and have some of my favorite oysters and seafood in the city. They also host a $1 USD oyster happy hour on their entire selection 4–6pm during the week which I think is the best deal in the city! 5. Miss Korea BBQ 10 W. 32nd Street This is my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in the city. Granted I’m not a Korean BBQ expert but the meat here is delicious and they give you a TON of sides of a dizzying variety which to me is the best part of Korean BBQ. Bring on the unlimited kimchi!. The fact that it’s usually full of Koreans is something I take as a good sign. 6. SriPraPhai Thai Restaurant 64-13 39th Avenue Flushing Queens The best and most authentic Thai restaurant in New York. As someone who has lived in Thailand I rarely find a place I like. It’s never as good. I hardly ever get Thai food because I’m always disappointed but this place is the real thing. It’s as close to getting to eating in Thailand as you can get. I especially like the som tam papaya salad here. It’s legit. 7. Tomoe Sushi 172 Thompson Street This tiny restaurant serves big cuts of fish on perfectly warmed rice. Their torofatty tuna is outstanding. Tomoe is considered one of the best sushi bars in the city and gets packed quickly so come early or for lunch. Prices here aren’t on the cheap side but their $18 USD lunch set offers the best value. 8. Yuba 105 E. 9th Street My favorite sushi bar in the city this little restaurant is easily missed. I visit here too often — so often they gave me cake on my birthday and call me up when they have hard-to-get or especially fresh fish. I take all my friends here. It’s consistently the best sushi I’ve found for the best price. Try the lemon roll you have to ask for it it’s not on the menu the toro and the uni. Tell Jack and Nina that I sent you. 9. Russ & Daughters 179 E. Houston Street This is the best breakfast and brunch joint in the city hands down. Nothing even comes close. Come here for latkes lox plates world-class cream cheese and anything else breakfast/deli like you can think of. There are two sections the restaurant and the deli. The restaurant always has a long long wait so if you don’t get there early it’s better to grab from the deli around the corner and eat elsewhere. 10. Left Bank 117 Perry Street Located in the West Village this French restaurant offers a wonderful $20 USD Sunday prix fixe dinner that is one of the best budget meals in the city. You get two courses and wine in a romantically lit setting. My roommates and I also come here often especially if we want a nice quiet bonding evening! 11. Sao Mai 203 1st Ave A great Vietnamese place located near my apartment this place serves pho that rocks my world. The portions are huge here and according to my friend Jodi who is an expert in all food Vietnamese this place is authentic. 12. S’MAC 345 E 12th St A mac-and-cheese shop that takes the traditional dish and makes it even better. It’s heavenly cheesy goodness. Their 4-Cheese and Cheeseburger are my two favorites. The fact that this place is around the block from my house has become a problem though — I’m eating there too often and may be getting a S’MAC belly! 13. Masala Times 194 Bleecker St I was only recently turned on to this place near the NYU campus. Serving Bombay-style street food this place serves some really good Indian meals. I couldn’t get enough of it. The plates are sharable and you get rice and bread too. Try the Fish Tikka — it’s delicious. 14. Vanessa’s Dumpling 220 E 14th St I stumbled upon this place in the East Village while walking home one day it was only later that I found out it’s actually quite famous. After eating their dumplings it’s easy to see why. They were delicious — the pork dumplings had an intense flavor to them. And at 10 for $2 the price is just right. 15. Prosperity Dumplings 46 Eldridge St Located in Chinatown this is another amazing dumpling place. The pork dumplings come fried or steamed and there’s a nearby park where you can sit if this tiny place is full. And if you want more for later? You can buy 50 frozen dumplings for $8! 16. John’s on Bleecker 278 Bleecker St Pizza in New York is an institution and I admit I’m no pizza guru. To me it’s either bad good or really good. I can’t make those fine pizza distinctions like some New Yorkers can. I qualify John’s as really good. The thin-style pizza comes in huge portions big enough to serve three. Service is quick but expect to wait for a table during dinner. 17. Chelsea Market 75 9th Ave Chelsea Market is more a collection of food places than a single restaurant. It’s extremely popular and a great place to pop into when you need some groceries a meal or snacks. You’ll find good Thai food here and Amy’s Bread has amazing bread. The Lobster Place has decent sushi and great lobster but I really enjoy their clam chowder. If you want a meal with local and organic food try the Green Table. 18. Rosemary’s 18 Greenwich Ave This West Village Italian restaurant boasts a rooftop farm with fresh produce and herbs that goes directly into the food you eat. Their handmade pastas are a must-eat and they have a good Rosé selection. It’s one of the best weekend brunch locations in the city too. Come early because it fills up really quickly especially on nice warm day. 19. Bennie’s Thai Café 88 Fulton St As someone who has lived in Thailand I’m quite picky about my Thai but this restaurant is legit. It’s a popular lunch spot with the working crowd and serves incredible curry. It’s one of the few locations where I can get an authentic Thai iced tea too! Service is a little too fast and abrupt but who cares? The food is incredible. 20. Mamoun’s Falafel 119 MacDougal St You will find inexpensive falafel and gyro stands all over Manhattan but the best one is Mamoun’s. You can pick up a classic falafel with tahini and salad for less than $5 but all the options here are tasty and affordable. 21. Karasu 166 Delkab Ave This is often considered a restaurant and cocktail bar but it’s more of an izakaya speakeasy you’ll need to enter through a secret door. It has an elegant ambiance and the drinks are top-notch. The menu isn’t huge but everything is delicious. 22. Peter Luger Steakhouse 255 Northern Blvd Located in Williamsburg this is the best steakhouse in the city. It’s an institution in the city. The restaurant has a German beer hall feel and the steak which they age in-house is some of the best I’ve had in my life. 23. Eat’s Khao Man Gai  518 E 6th St This is a tiny restaurant with a limited menu but the food here is absolutely delicious. Their Thai-style Hainanese chicken and rice is simple but tasty. 24. Friend of a Farmer 77 Irving Pl Since 1986 Friend of a Farmer has been embracing the farm-to-table movement offering seasonal dishes as well as classic comfort food. The food is filling and hearty. They have a great brunch too! 25. Pete’s Tavern 129 E 18th St This vintage bar has been open since 1864. It’s an unpretentious place where you can enjoy some pub food and enjoy that classic tavern atmosphere. *** After living in the city for years this list reflects what I think are some of the best and most unique offerings the Big Apple has to offer. But this is just the tip of the iceberg too. New York City has some of the greatest bars and restaurants in the world and you could spend a lifetime and a fortune trying them all.

February 8 2016 at 210 pm Matt how do you do those mapped lists that show details for each spot? Would love to add that to my site as I review breweries and restaurants in and around NYC. Hard to condense NYC down to such a short list but I’d add Friend of a Farmer near Gramercy Park and Jacob’s Pickles on the Upper West Side for brunch. The latter has fried chicken sandwiches on homemade buttermilk biscuits. Get there early! Reply Asar February 8 2016 at 1057 pm You can easily create the map that Matt has with My Maps On Google. Just search for it on Google. Reply D.L. February 28 2016 at 522 pm Hey Matt! I’ve been bizzzy but just thought I’d put my two cents in since I am back on your site again. You may remember I’m in NYC too and I agree with Kyle B. it’s hard to condense NYC down to such a short list! I am on the upper west side but I travel to all boroughs & neighborhoods on a regular basis -except Staten Island. I cook on a regular basis now but many of the good places I’ve visited are still around! Ive been here for 19 years. I am guessing you live downtown near the former 5points area but I have a bunch of recommendations for you all over the city!! What’s the best way to share that info- I wonder? D Reply Beatrice February 8 2016 at 531 pm That sushi looks so good and all the other options to dine out are equally as tempting! Thanks Matt for sharing these good addresses with us. Haven’t been to NYC yet so this will be very handy for a foodie like me. Reply Stephen Gollan February 8 2016 at 749 pm New York is such a foodie destination.

There are a lot of yummy ones to try. Reply Pierce Sohlden February 15 2016 at 924 pm Hey Matt This list helps a lot. I have been to NYC before but it was when I was very young so I do not remember anything. So I don’t really count that time and NYC is at the near the top of my list of places to go.

Accommodation in NYC is not cheap — and it’s often hard to find deals. That’s in part by design. There used to be a lot of hostels in NYC but the hotel lobby got the city to use an old law meant to block tenements and limit the number of people that could stay in a single room. This effectively shut down most of the hostels in town except for a few that were grandfathered in. Now you’re only going to find a few hostels left. Demand outstrips supply. Even though there aren’t hundreds of hostels to choose from there are enough to make a best hostels in NYC” post so you’ll know which are worth staying at there are a few that are really terrible and to be avoided. Over the years I’ve stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in NYC are Location – New York is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In NYC you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and some have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel!

It’s a city on everyone’s bucket list. I’ve been dozens of times and my love for the city is well known to you all. I can’t imagine a year in which I don’t go even for a little bit. To me Paris has it all music history food culture and beautiful architecture. It’s got that special something. I dream of moving to Paris to live out that writer cliché…if only for a while! As a visitor to Paris knowing where to stay can be difficult. There are lots of arrondissements neighborhoods. Which is the best? For a tourist there’s really no bad neighborhood. Nowhere you stay is going to be too far or unsafe forget what you hear about in the news. Paris’s metro goes everywhere and stays open late. However that said Paris has hundreds and hostels. How do you know which are the best ones? The city is expensive and as someone who has stayed in some less-than-stellar accommodations for way too much money I know the price of making the wrong decision. I’ve been visiting Paris for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel.

The other hostles in this post look great and I’ll definitely book one on my next trip! Reply Andrea November 17 2018 at 601 am They are actually called arrondissements not androssiments. There are 20 of them. It’s common for Parisians to refer to them and the arrondissement is listed on street signs as well. As a visitor to Paris it’s helpful to be familiar with them.

Before I went everyone told me Bogotá wasn’t anything special dirty crowded hard to get around and lacking the charm of the other big cities in Colombia. Spend a few days there and move on” they all said. Well I spent a few days there — and then a few more. I LOVED Bogotá. It felt like the most Colombian” city I visited. It’s not like the gringofied cities in the rest of the country. Its gritty” nature was what appealed to me. Bogotá was a vibrant lively city I couldn’t get enough of. The museum scene is incredible there’s a lot of history a blossoming art community an exciting food scene a wild nightlife and super welcoming people. It is also a huge city with a ton of tours day trips and other things to do. You could easily spend a week here. To help you make the most out of your visit here are my top 20 things to see and do in Bogotá. 20 Things to See and Do in Bogotá 1. Take a Free Walking Tour One of my favorite things to do when I get to a new destination is to take a free walking tour. It’s a great way to get the lay of the land see the main sights and have a local expert answer any and all of my questions. BeyondColombia has a great free walking tour that will give you a solid introduction to the city. It also has a free food tour which is a terrific way to get a taste of some local Colombian dishes you’ll spend around 18000 COP/$6 USD on food for the tour. Just be sure to tip your guides! For a more specialized tour check out the Bogotá Graffiti Tour. This one operates by donation using the money raised to reinvest in future community art projects. 2. Stroll in the Botanical Gardens Opened in 1955 the Botanical Garden of Bogotá is home to almost 20000 plants. There is a focus on regional plants usually those that are endemic to the Andes and other high-alpine regions of the continent. It’s a really peaceful place to walk around and there are some food stalls nearby so you can grab a quick bite as you explore the gardens and browse the exotic flowers and trees.

Climb Monserrate Standing tall at over 3000 meters you can see Monserrate from pretty much everywhere in town. It’s a popular spot to take in the view and since there is a church at the summit it’s also a popular spot for local weddings. You can walk up yourself in under an hour or you can take a cable car or funicular to the top. Keep in mind that the walk up isn’t that safe at night or alone — thieves scout out the route.

It’s an amazing city and to be honest shopping in Chapinero is very good if you’re into those sort of thing. But yea I felt 3 days weren’t enough for Bogota and I wanted to stay longer plus it had my ideal temperature. Reply Kathleen April 4 2019 at 950 am Paloquemao market was one place we visited on our trip to bogota in February that Matt did not mention. Between the flowers  Colombia is one of the worlds leading exporters of roses to the beautiful exotic fruits and fresh foods it’s a fantastic place to wander in the morning. The hardest thing about Bogota is getting around. We used uber but heard it is not legal and taxis throw stones at uber cars. Solution is to sit in front seat. City is spread out with more than 10 million people. Traffic is horrible. Reply Patty Dwyer April 5 2019 at 720 pm thanks for sharing with us about unfortunate situation mugging stab. being in public hospital gave you the insight- interesting. Hope you’re feeling much better. would be neat to read and see pictures of people and inside their home. Reply Lara Hayes December 3 2019 at 949 pm I’ve heard a lot of negative comments about Bogota but I agree with you. I really like the city. I’ve spent 5 weeks here taking spanish lessons and exploring and I don’t get why people are so mean about it. I am sad you got knifed here but I am glad you have given such a balanced view on it. I have felt largely safe whilst in Bogota 🙂 Reply Leave a Comment Cancel reply By posting a comment you agree to our community friendly anti-spam comment policy that can be found here.

They are stunning important historical sites to see and experience. But the city also offers lots of fun things to do that have fewer crowds and are a bit off the beaten path. As important as it is to visit culturally significant historical sites after all there’s nothing wrong with being a tourist there is so much more to every destination than just the main tourist bullet points. Of course you shouldn’t miss Istanbul’s major sites. But once you’ve done them there are plenty of offbeat things to see and do here. Here are my favorites to help you get started and make the most out of your trip 1. Descend into the Basilica Cistern Most travelers walk on top of this ancient cavern for days without realizing it. After entering an unassuming doorway you’ll climb down a gloomy set of stairs ending up in an underground former water reservoir built in the sixth century. It’s filled with centuries-old columns and statues and the space is eerily lit in shades of orange. Koi fish swim in the standing water and you have to walk on wooden planks to get around. You can hear drips echoing and there are two mysterious statues with the head of Medusa. It kind of feels like you’re in a scary movie. Alemdar Yerebatan Cd. 1/3 +90 212-512-1570 yerebatansarnici.com. Open daily from 9am-530pm except religious holidays. Admission is 20 TRY for foreigners. 2. Explore the Asian Side Istanbul is the only city in the world to straddle two continents it spans from Europe to Asia. The Asian side also called the Anatolian side is separated from the European side by the Bosphorus Strait. You can take a bus over the famous Bosphorus Bridge or you can ride over on a ferry. The city’s main tourist sites are on the European side but if you’ve never been to Asia it’s fun to cross over so you can say you’ve been there. If you’re interested in shopping check out the popular markets in Kadiköy. Other worthy activities include touring the Beylerbeyi Palace riding up to the top of Çamlica Hill for incredible views of the city and strolling along Bagdat Caddesi to explore the many restaurants cafés and shops. The ferry will cost 3 TRY for a one-way ticket. 3. Visit a Real Hammam Picture not available—everyone was naked inside! Many of the swanky hotels in Istanbul have hammams otherwise known as Turkish baths but they usually aren’t the real deal. They’re made for Westerners looking for a cushy and modest experience. Real hammams have been a Turkish tradition for thousands of years and they have served as both a place to cleanse and to socialize. Most hammams are separated by gender and women generally go topless. You transition through several different rooms of different temperatures one being a hot steam room much like a sauna. You can opt to pay an attendant to give you a thorough scrub-down — it’s rough but invigorating! Çemberlitai Hamami is a good option for visitors looking to give the experience a try another popular one is Cagaloglu. Both are located in the Old Town. Vezirhan Cad. No. 8 +90 552-381-1584 cemberlitashamami.com. Open daily from 6am-12am. Admission starts at 160 TRY per person and goes up from there depending on what treatments/services you want. 4. Go to the Prince Islands This chain of nine islands off the coast of Istanbul provides a unique getaway from the crowds. An easy day trip during the warm months the islands are just a quick ferry ride from the city. Most travelers visit the four larger islands Büyükada the biggest and most popular Burgazada Heybeliada and Kinaliada. You can explore historic buildings eat at tasty cafés and see beautiful homes as you wander about. What makes these islands special is that no cars are allowed on the islands making them quite peaceful and quiet and a nice break from the noise of the city. You can get around by walking bicycle or horse and carriage. Try to take one of the early ferries in the day so you explore the islands before our visitors arrive. The journey by ferry will take around 1 hour and 30 minutes depending on what island you are going to. Tickets are 5 TRY per person for a single journey ticket. 5. Take a Ferry A great way to explore this massive city is by boat. You’ll see many boats that offer paid tours of the Bosphorus but if you want to save money and have more flexibility take a regular ferry ride instead. The fare will be cheaper and you won’t be competing for space with other tourists trying to take photos. You’ll pass by Topkapi Palace the Bosphorus Bridge gorgeous mansions mosques with massive minarets other castles and palaces and more. You can hop off eat some fresh seafood and then head back. It’s a budget-friendly way to explore without bumping into other tourists. Round-trip ferry tickets will cost 25 TRY per person. 6. Explore Jewish History While Turkey is predominantly a Muslim country it has a surprisingly long Jewish history. There are Jewish heritage tours you can take or you can explore the stops on your own. Jews have lived in Turkey for thousands of years but the population really grew during the Ottoman Empire in the 1400s. Growth increased in 1492 when Spain expelled its Jews and the Ottoman Empire welcomed them as they were stereotyped as having good business skills and wealth. Istanbul’s Galata and Balat quarters are steeped in Jewish history and you can find historic synagogues in both areas of town. Istanbul also has a Jewish museum The Museum of Turkish Jews that does a good job of illustrating the contributions and struggles of Jews in Turkey. Bereketzade Mahallesi +90 212-292-6333 muze500.com. Open Sunday-Thursday from 10am-5pm and Fridays from 10am-1pm closed Saturdays. Admission is free though donations are encouraged. Passport or other official ID is required to enter. 7. Watch the Fishermen on Galata Bridge Every day dozens if not hundreds of local men form a row along the top level of the Galata Bridge and fish over the edge. It’s an incredible sight. They spend hours hoping to catch fresh seafood and some of them will sell it to you while they’re still out there fishing. Many of the men don’t even make a catch they seem to enjoy just standing there hanging their pole over the water. There’s also a fish market at the base of the bridge and the many booths of fresh-caught fish are fun to look at though it can also be a bit gross. 8. See the Obelisk of Theodosius This Egyptian obelisk was carved around 1500 BCE near Luxor before it was pillaged by the Romans and moved to Alexandria. Not long after it was moved to Constantinople now Istanbul where it has remained ever since. There are well-preserved hieroglyphs on all four sides which depict Tutmoses III’s victory during a battle on the Euphrates River. The obelisk is usually surrounded by locals relaxing and chatting and there are often buskers performing here as well. It’s a good place to sit back and people-watch while appreciating this incredible historical relic. 9. Snap a Photo with Tombili Chances are you already know you Tombili is — you just don’t realize it. Tombili was a street cat from Istanbul who went viral in a meme that showed the cat lounging on the stairs like a person would sit on a bench the meme was called chill cat” if you want to look it up. When Tombili died in 2016 the local mayor had a statue commissioned and it now sits where Tombili’s famous photo was taken. Thieves immediately stole the statue but after a huge public outcry it was returned. 10. Visit Miniaturk Miniaturk is a miniature park located in Istanbul — and it’s one of the largest miniature parks in the world. To be honest I didn’t even know what miniature parks were before encountering this place. In short the park is full of small replicas of famous sights and attractions made to a 1/25 scale. There are over 100 models in the park including the Obelisk of Theodosius the Mostar Bridge and the Hagia Eirene Church. The park spans almost 15 acres and there are audio guides available around the park so you can listen and learn more about each individual attraction. Örnektepe +90 212-222-2882 miniaturk.com.tr. Open daily from 9am-6pm. Admission is 15 TRY. *** Istanbul is a very large and crowded city and it can definitely be intimidating to visit. But it’s also home to some fascinating history and tons of unique sights and attractions — many of which don’t get the attention they deserve. By adding some of these less-visited attractions into your itinerary you’ll be able to have a much more unique and authentic experience while still being able to see all the wonderful sights that make Istanbul the eclectic beautiful city that it is. Book Your Trip to Istanbul Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.

You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the most comprehensive inventory.

She and her girlfriend Natalie have been traveling around the continent for the past two years. Here’s what they’ve learned from traveling as a lesbian couple in Asia. Asia is a vibrant diverse and exciting continent to visit. However for LGBT travelers it can sometimes seem like a daunting prospect. There are countries that criminalize homosexuality deeply pious states and regions and places that have negative social opinions of the LGBT community. It doesn’t exactly sound like all fun and rainbows does it? When my girlfriend and I set off on our Asian adventures two years ago we had no idea what to expect but admittedly were rattled. Not only were we backpacking for the first time but we were traveling as a couple. Neither of us were really into social media at that point so it almost felt like we were alone. The only lesbian couple to ever travel! Sounds silly I know but that’s how it felt. Fast-forward two years and we’ve spent the better part of that time traveling around Asia. And do you know what? Gay travel there has been one hell of a ride! I mean we’ve experienced it all we’ve visited gay-friendly destinations attended illegal drag shows stayed with local families and on the rare occasion been the victim of discrimination and hostility. With this in mind we have put together this comprehensive guide for LGBT travelers in Asia excluding the Middle-East & Russia. We want to share our experiences as a same-sex couple in Asia as well as lay out all the factors that you should consider when planning your trip. We believe that travel should be for everyone and with our guidance you can look forward to an incredible and most importantly safe journey of a lifetime. Tip 1 Research local laws When planning your trip it’s important to be aware of local laws regarding the LGBT community in each country you want to visit. At the same time I don’t want you to make the common mistake of obsessing about these laws. Or worse letting the law prevent you from visiting certain places. Often the laws relating to acts of homosexuality are incredibly complex. Some only apply to gay men others mean the LGBT community are not protected from discrimination and some countries implement sharia law. Governments do not expect tourists to get their head around this for the sake of a two-week trip. As a result these laws are usually only enforced for locals not tourists. Nevertheless that’s not to say you shouldn’t exercise caution when in public places. We suggest avoiding any public display of affection PDA or anything you think may draw unnecessary attention. Not just for the purpose of the law but for the sake of being respectful. I will touch further on understanding local cultures and social opinions below. On the other hand some LGBT travelers may not want to even visit countries where these laws exist. And that’s understandable. But Asia is a huge continent. To put things into perspective out of the 72 countries that still criminalize homosexuality just 10 are in Asia outside the Middle East and Russia. That means that even if you wanted to boycott the countries where anti-gay laws are in place close to 80% of Asia is yours for the taking. Personally we don’t have an issue visiting countries where homosexuality is illegal. We’ve spent a lot of time in the past two years in Malaysia for example where Islamic law prevails and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Pristine beaches delectable cuisine vibrant culture — what’s not to love? In the larger cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Penang we found a buzzing LGBT community. And we even illegally attended a spectacular drag show! So I guess what I’m trying to say is you don’t need to dismiss traveling in Asia for the sake of a few old-fashioned laws. Gay travel there is way too much fun for that! Here are a few resources to help you research local laws The International Lesbian and Gay Association – Their world map summarizes sexual orientation laws by country. Human Dignity Trust – This website has fact sheets on countries that criminalize homosexuality. State Sponsored Homophobia Report – Check out their 2017 world survey for a list of sexual orientation laws. Tip 2 Understand the local culture Understanding and respecting the local culture in each place you visit is just as — if not more — important than the first tip. Why? Well think about it you’re going to spend way more time in the company of residents than you are around law enforcement officers. Comprehending the social opinion of locals could save you a lot of awkwardness and funny looks in the long run. You see what we discovered is that even in some countries where homosexuality is legal it remains taboo in the community. This could be due to religious beliefs a lack of education around the subject or in some cases plain bigotry. However isn’t that so in most places? Even in the most advanced countries I think we can safely say there is room for improvement. At the same time understanding the local culture is also important for every traveler. PDA for example is frowned upon in most countries in Asia — even if you are a straight couple. On the other hand holding hands with somebody of the same sex is extremely common in India whether it be your brother sister friend or otherwise. This is why it’s essential to educate yourself in advance so you know what to expect. The typical social situations we have found ourselves in have never been a cause for concern when traveling in Asia. Often people assume we are sisters or friends. And even on the rare occasion that we’ve tried to explain our relationship some locals don’t understand. We once stayed with a family in Indonesia for over a week and they never could get their head around the fact that we were a couple. But that was OK with us. What’s important is that they treated us like family and honestly it’s one of our most memorable travel experiences. On the other hand there have been times where we were allocated a twin room despite booking a double been catcalled for being lesbians and had religious jargon thrown at us. But again doesn’t this happen everywhere? We certainly didn’t allow these minor incidents to ruin our travel experience. On the grand scale of things these are few and far between amid all the breathtaking experiences we had. The United Nations Development Programme has a series of country reports about Being LGBT in Asia including in-depth sections devoted to cultural and social attitudes. Tip 3 Be prepared to adapt When you take into consideration everything we’ve talked about being prepared to adapt is part and parcel of gay travel in Asia. Although when you think about it doesn’t this apply to all travelers? What I’m trying to say is that any place you travel to is bound to require an element of adaptation whether it be the food you eat the clothes you wear or the way in which you address the locals. It’s about recognizing what’s socially acceptable and behaving in a way that’s both respectful and appropriate. That said it’s a controversial subject whether LGBT couples should travel to destinations where they can’t be entirely themselves. We get challenged on this a lot and our point is simply this There are many elements to some religions cultures and the like that I’m sure many of us don’t agree with. However does that mean we should boycott those countries? I think it would leave a very limited pool to choose from if that were the case. At the same time we can empathize with those who may not feel comfortable traveling to places where they can’t be themselves. Or perhaps feel anxious as a solo LGBT traveler or an LGBT couple. If this is the case there are plenty of gay-friendly travel destinations both in Asia and elsewhere in the world. Either way so long as you do your research and take all the necessary precautions you have no reason to be afraid. Tip 4 Look up the local gay scene When traveling to a new place one of the first things we do is look up if there’s a local gay scene. Let’s face it everybody knows that gay bars are the most fun! But on a serious note it’s comforting knowing there is a safe place you can go to — a space where you can be yourself without judgment and let your hair down. Thankfully most Asian countries boast an active gay scene of some kind. Particularly in the big cities you can expect to find gay bars nightclubs saunas gay-friendly hotels and drag shows in abundance! We’ve had some of the wildest nights of our travels exploring the local gay scene. Whether it’s bar-hopping in Bangkok or attending illegal drag shows in Kuala Lumpur you’re guaranteed a night to remember! While a quick Google search will tell you where all the queer fun is at Travel Gay Asia is an excellent website for finding LGBT-friendly spots in any city. Tip 5 Connect with other LGBT travelers or locals Again socializing with people who understand you and won’t judge you is a reassuring way to adapt to a new place or culture. Of course locating the local gay scene is a great start however not everybody has the guts to walk into a bar or nightclub on their own and attempt to make friends. Thankfully there are easier ways of meeting people in this day and age. Yes the good old web has inundated us with opportunities to connect with like-minded people. We suggest using social media to locate other LGBT travelers or locals in your area. Facebook is a fantastic platform for this where a simple search will yield results for any LGBT groups in your area. Similarly navigating certain hashtags on Instagram such as #gaybangkok or #LGBTAsia can help you locate all things LGBT near you. Some useful platforms for meeting people are Tinder Plenty of Fish Couchsurfing Purple Roofs for finding LGBT-friendly accommodation You don’t need to use the above dating apps in any sort of romantic way either — they are just great resources for connecting with LGBT locals and travelers. If you’re lucky you may find yourself connecting with a local who can show you all the best spots in their area. *** While Gay Travel in Asia might seem daunting it is far less scary than it sounds on paper. As a whole we can honestly say we had nothing but a positive experience and made memories that will last us a lifetime. Asia is an extraordinary continent oozing adventure beauty and culture. By following the advice in our article and taking advantage of all the useful resources we’ve provided we are confident Asia will steal your heart. Just as she has stolen ours.

It’s home to an award-winning wine industry and the cool capital of Tbilisi which has a stunning Old Town and vibrant nightlife. And to top it all off the Caucasus Mountains offer incredible hiking and climbing for anyone looking to explore the outdoors. Georgia deserves all the praise it gets. It really is jam-packed with activities and attractions and is slowly starting to get on people’s radar. I loved my time there and my only regret is that I didn’t have more of it but I guess that’s just a reason to go back right?. It may not be one of the most obvious places to travel but if you want an eclectic destination that doesn’t have a lot of crowds and is safe inexpensive and filled with great food and drink Georgia is it! I can’t recommend it enough. Here’s a list of what I consider to be some of the best things to see and do in Georgia 1. Visit Tbilisi Georgia’s capital is home to just over a million people and has started to gain a reputation as a progressive city that offers an amazing blend of old and new. Tbilisi is surrounded by hills one of which is home to the ruins of Narikala Fortress which dates back to the fourth century. Take the cable car up for amazing views overlooking the city and the Mtkvari River. And the restored historic Old Town is full of colorful window frames gorgeous balconies ornate spiral staircases and intriguing alleyways to explore. In contrast with this history there are also lots of modern sights to see in Tbilisi like the ultramodern bow-shaped Peace Bridge and a growing number of trendy bars and restaurants. If you’re looking to party the night away be sure to visit Bassiani one of the most popular nightclubs in town. 2. Try a Sulfur Bath Tbilisi is known for its sulfur baths natural hot springs with minerals that are said to help with problems such as joint pain arthritis eczema and dry skin. They have been a staple of the city since it was founded and are now a popular pastime for tourists and locals alike. There are actually over two thousand mineral springs throughout Georgia so you can have a spa day outside Tbilisi as well. The baths underneath the Narikala Fortress are the easiest place to try this popular Georgian tradition you can also get a traditional scrub and massage. The baths are easy to spot they have large brick domes rising out of the ground that cover the healing waters. Expect to pay at least 50 GEL Georgian lari $17 USD for a budget bathhouse or 100 GEL $34 USD for a nicer one. 3. The Chronicle of Georgia Just outside Tbilisi the Chronicle of Georgia is made up of 16 enormous pillars and columns with carved images that illustrate the nation’s history each of which is over 30 meters tall! Some people call this Georgia’s Stonehenge” but there’s nothing ancient or mystical about it — the memorial was built in 1985 by a Georgian sculptor although it was never finished. It’s easy to reach the Chronicle by taking the metro and then walking a short distance. In addition to seeing this unusual monument which is free you’ll also get a beautiful view over the city and the Tbilisi Sea. 4. See Mtskheta Mtskheta was an ancient capital of Georgia and today is known as the religious center of the country. It’s about a half-hour north of Tbilisi and is home to historic churches and beautiful buildings from the Middle Ages some of them are UNESCO World Heritage sites as well. The entire city was also declared a Holy City by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2014. One of the best things to do in Mtskheta is to go up to Jvari Monastery on the hilltop most famous for being where Christianity was declared the official religion in 319 CE. The monastery itself was built in the sixth century and has survived nearly unchanged since then. From here you’ll be treated to stunning views over the town and the two rivers that meet at Mtskheta. Also don’t miss a visit to the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral which dates to the 11th century and the fourth-century Samtavro Monastery. 5. Eat Khachapuri There are all kinds of traditional Georgian foods you can try but the one that all visitors seem to leave Georgia raving about is khachapuri. It’s basically a cheesy bread that can come with various toppings and in various shapes sometimes looking a bit like a pizza and other times more like a big bread roll. Every region of Georgia has its own version but probably the most famous is Adjarian khachapuri. It comes in a kind of boat shape and is first filled with cheese and then topped with an egg. Another popular food you’ll want to try is kudari which is a large leavened bread pocket stuffed with meat usually pork or lamb and vegetables. 6. Visit the Vadrzia Cave Monastery The Vadrzia Cave Monastery is located near Aspindza in the south of Georgia about four hours from Tbilisi by car. It’s one of the most famous monasteries in the entire country. Built in the 11th century it’s a system of caves dug into the side of Erusheli Mountain. Originally the complex included 13 levels and over 6000 apartments. These were used to help protect the locals from the Mongols who ravaged the entire region in the 12th century. These days — after earthquake damage and raids from invaders — there are around three hundred surviving apartments and halls that can still be accessed. Additionally the underground Church of the Dormition is still intact which is home to murals depicting historical scenes of Georgian royalty. 7. Hit the Slopes Georgia probably isn’t your first thought for a skiing holiday. However the country is rapidly becoming well known in Europe and Asia as a fun and affordable ski destination and more lifts are being added each season. It shares the highest mountain range in the region and has plenty of snow in the winter making it a great place to ski. Plus it’s a whole lot cheaper than many options in Europe. At the moment there are four main ski resort areas Gudauri Mestia Goderdzi and Bakuriani. There’s even a ski school with English-speaking instructors in Gudauri which is only a two-hour drive from Tbilisi. You can get lift passes for as little as 30 GEL $10 USD. 8. See the Katskhi Pillar For a particularly unique sight head to western Georgia’s Katskhi Pillar. This huge limestone monolith is a natural tower that stands over 130 feet high. You can reach Katskhi in a couple of hours from Batumi or in about three and a half hours from Tbilisi. But that’s not all — built on the top of this narrow pillar is a church complex dating back to the seventh century. Until 2015 a monk actually lived up on top but these days the monks sleep in the monastery at the bottom — and only monks are allowed to climb up the steel ladder on the side as part of their daily pilgrimage to pray in the church. The buildings were refurbished recently and a visitor center is in the works. 9. Go Hiking or Trekking If you like hiking or trekking then you’re going to love Georgia. The Caucasus Mountains stretch from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea — over 1000km — so there are plenty of possibilities. The most popular multi-day trek is walking from Mestia to Ushguli 4 days. There are enough villages along the route that you don’t need to camp. Not surprisingly the scenery along the way is magnificent. As Georgia is a hiker’s paradise there are literally dozens of other hiking possibilities so look around and see what kind of trek fits what you’re after. Some suggestions worth considering are Omalo to Shatili 5 days Chaukhi Pass 1-2 days and Svaneti to Racha a challenging 3-4 days. 10. Try Georgian Wine It’s said that Georgia has the oldest winemaking history in the world. Georgians have been making wine for over 8000 years so you can bet they’re pretty good at it by now. They use qvevri clay pots buried in the ground to ferment grapes for a unique taste. The climate in Georgia is perfect for winemaking too so it’s no wonder that Georgian wine is starting to win awards internationally. There are five main wine regions in Georgia but the largest and most visited is Kakheti in the east. Technically you can make it a day trip from Tbilisi but it deserves more than just a few hours. If you want to explore the vineyards then pick either Sighnaghi or Telavi as a base. 11. Explore the Coast If you’re looking for some rest and relaxation Georgia even has a beach resort region along the coast. At Batumi located on the Black Sea you’ll find subtropical temperatures perfect for swimming. It can get quite humid in summer too. You can chill out at a beach resort near Batumi or explore some of the craziness this part of Georgia has to offer it’s sometimes described as the Las Vegas of the Black Sea. The region is home to some unique architecture and a number of casinos though it also has the enormous Batumi Botanical Gardens which boasts one of the most diverse ranges of flora you’ll see in a botanical garden anywhere. 12. Visit Gergeti Trinity Church Built in the 14th century this church tucked away near Mount Kazbek is perched almost 2200 meters above sea level and draws crowds from all over the country. It’s one of the most picturesque spots in all of Georgia offering stunning views of the mountain range which you’ve probably seen on Instagram. While you can visit on a day trip from Tbilisi a better idea is to head to Stepantsminda and stay there overnight. That way you can see the church in the morning which offers great light for photos while beating the tourist crowds that will eventually arrive from the capital. 13. The Caves of Gareja Located near the border with Azerbaijan this is a Georgian Orthodox complex that dates back to the sixth century. Here you’ll find hundreds of small rooms small chapels churches and monastic living quarters carved out of the rock face. The monastery survived incursions from the Mongols and Persians but was shut down under Soviet rule and used for military training which caused a lot of damage to the buildings. Today you can visit the complex on a day trip from Tbilisi. The journey takes around three hours by bus and bus tickets cost 25 GEL $9 USD. 14. Visit Gori Gori is the hometown of Joseph Stalin the brutal Soviet leader. Located 90 minutes from Tbilisi the city is home to the popular Stalin Museum which has lots of artifacts including the wooden hut where he was born and information about his life — all of it whitewashed and biased of course. Here you’ll also find a World War II museum that focuses on the achievements of the Red Army as well as Gori Fortress a citadel that dates back to the 17th century and offers a panoramic view of the region. Although it’s close enough for a day trip from Tbilisi you can stay in this small city of just 50000 for a day or two if you want to get away from the crowds. 15. Get Outdoors in Svaneti This is one of the most beautiful regions in the entire country. Tucked away in the northwestern corner of Georgia you’ll find many tiny villages and incredible hiking here. There are also several UNESCO heritage sites in the area including watchtowers that date back to the 12th century. You’ll also be completely enveloped by the Caucasus Mountains which provide both a picturesque backdrop and stunning views. Stay in Mestia a tiny village of fewer than 2000 people and head out on foot or by car to explore the region. You’ll also find some of the best cheese in the country made by traditional methods kept alive by the Svans an ethnic subgroup. The region is one of the most remote areas in Georgia — see it before the tourists arrive. *** This list just scratches the surface when it comes to the incredible things to see and do that Georgia has to offer. There are dozens more historical sites monasteries caves and castles to see and a whole lot more stunning landscapes to explore. And the country is quite safe too. Whether you just have a few days to enjoy Tbilisi and its surroundings or a couple of weeks to cover more of rural Georgia too you are not going to be disappointed!

Reply Renuka January 6 2020 at 507 am Georgia is one of the countries that I’d really like to visit in 2020. A paradise for hikers and wine lovers! Wow…I couldn’t have asked for a better destination! The fact that it’s inexpensive and safe makes it an even better deal. Reply Rolands Ratfelders January 8 2020 at 348 am Thanks for a great article Matt! As it is about 3 hours flight from Riga we Latvians are visiting Georgia quite often. We have been are always very welcomed there and the Baltic people are considered big friends of Georgians and we really are. Just some notes. – Tbilisi is really awesome. I’ve traveled a lot but it is still one of my favorite cities in the world. As for the sulfur bath well it’s a unique yet still very soviet experience. There are separate sections for men and women. The infrastructure is very outdated though. You’ll have a glimpse of soviet-style there – Khachapuri is a good thing. Yet Georgians eat bread and meat-based products a lot and they are very hospitable. So at one moment it gets a bit too much especially considering the extra weight you gain 🙂 – David Gareja is a place to visit for sure. Especially if you like something a bit off-the-beaten-path. I have an article on this place – Georgia is actually the first recorded country where the wine was made. So you cannot get wrong with it. I’m not the fan or Georgian whites but reds are awesome don’t hesitate to buy them even in plastic bottles in the shops. – Svaneti is a different world in Georgia. It’s worth many hours from Tbilisi to get there but go during the summer season. I got 11 degrees and rain in May there. – Don’t forget about the Kazbegi mountain area – a paradise for hikers. – Gori is the place where Latvians usually don’t go and we do not recommend others to do so too Stalin killed too many people to be honored by a visit or any attention at all. This evil personality is the only point of disagreement we have with Georgians. There are some other more hidden but not less gorgeous paces to go there. I love Georgia and recommend everyone to go there! Reply Steve March 10 2020 at 1245 am I spent two days in Tbilisi a few years ago and absolutely loved it. The food and wine was to die for the architecture stunning and the people very friendly. It’s a shame I didn’t get a chance to head into the Caucasus but I will return for a hiking trip one day soon. It’s also worth mentioning that it’s very easy to visit nearby Baku in Azerbaijan on the overnight train if you want to explore more of the region.

I’ve never been to the region and it’s long one that’s held great appeal to me. It seems raw beautiful and unspoiled. So when someone reached out to write a guest post on a country there I was excited. It was a chance to learn a little before I hopefully go. In this guest post traveler and writer Paul McDougal breaks down what it’s like to travel Tajikistan on a budget. Aptly and romantically known as The Roof of the World” Tajikistan is a hikers’ paradise. More than 93% of the country is defined as mountainous — and more than 50% of that sits at over 3000 meters 9800 feet! It’s a striking country full of glacial peaks and mountain lakes that are best for multiday hikes but equally astounding on short jaunts too. Traveling around Tajikistan requires a sense of adventure as the nation is also dotted with poor-quality roads rudimentary facilities and a massive lack of infrastructure. But after spending almost a month there I learned that it’s easy and affordable to get around these problems with a smile and a shrug. Many tourists spend more money than necessary when in Tajikistan. Most do so on an organized tour which is why there’s a prevailing — and inaccurate — idea that it’s expensive to visit the country. A ten-day organized tour booked online can cost anywhere from $1500 to $3500 USD equivalent to a hefty $150-350 a day. But if you travel independently you can easily navigate this country for about $45 USD per day. So how do you see Tajikistan on a budget? Here’s how Transportation Instead of booking a tour through an online agent you have four much more affordable ways to get around to choose from 1. Find a multiday driver when you arrive Hostels and guesthouses can put you in contact with local drivers with whom you can negotiate your own rate itinerary and trip length. Typically travelers spend $50-100 per day per person for this. The better your negotiation skills and the more stubborn you are the greater the chance you’ll get a driver for closer to $50 a day. Drivers can be found in Murghab Khorog Dushanbe and other larger places. If you’re traveling the Pamir Highway like pretty much everyone else in Tajikistan you can also find drivers in Kyrgyzstan’s second-biggest city Osh. 2. Hire a 4WD yourself This typically costs around $100 per day for the vehicle so if you’re traveling with a few people this is a great choice. It gives you freedom and it’s good for your budget! It’s very easy to organize this upon arrival. All hotels hostels and guesthouses in both Osh and Dushanbe can put you into contact with agencies that can arrange 4WD rentals. Don’t arrange this online unless you want to spend more money. 3. Public transport Long-distance public transport doesn’t really exist in Tajikistan. However enterprising locals have filled this gap in a very affordable way. Every day before they travel from one city or town to another to go about their daily business they always ensure that every single spot in their vehicle is filled. To find these travel opportunities ask your guesthouse where the bus station” is. They’ll direct you to a car-crammed area usually near a market where there will be drivers waiting to fill their cars. Using this method it’s not unusual to end up squashed into the back of an ancient car with four other people on a five-hour trip. These trips typically only costs around $10. And it’s a great way to immerse yourself in local life. The price of the trip depends upon its length. The most I paid was for any single trip was $35 USD for a 12-hour 600-mile voyage from Khorog to Dushanbe. And that was in a 4WD. A quick side note If you’re traveling within a city or town there are many small minibuses marshrutkas that can take you from one destination to another along prescribed routes for the measly price of around $0.20 USD. But along those routes they’ll stop anywhere to take on new passengers and drop off others. And I mean anywhere houses outdoor markets the middle of busy roads — it’s all fair game. 4. Hitchhiking For the vast majority of my trips in Tajikistan I hitchhiked. Local people hitchhike in Tajikistan every single day — it’s a valid recognized method of transport here as not everyone has a car and as mentioned above public transportation is scarce. When you hitchhike in Tajikistan don’t stick out your thumb. Keep your stretched-out hand parallel to the ground and wave it up and down. Depending on where you’re hitchhiking you will probably have to wait a while — on some barren stretches of road you might wait thirty minutes to see one car. But if that car has an empty spot it will stop and take you without fail. You might have to pay a little money. I experienced nothing but positivity and warmth doing this. People were happy to take me and introduced me to all sorts of Tajik food drinks and music. It’s not unusual for those who pick you up to offer you snacks buy you a meal or take you to their home. I always offered money in return for these treats but it was never accepted. Accommodation 1. Guesthouses In any town or city you’ll see houses with the word guesthouse” written on them. Go inside one and strike a deal. It’s the easiest and most affordable accommodation the perfect way to save money and have a better experience. You’ll be given great food and an even greater welcome. Throughout Tajikistan local people will let you stay in their home for around $10-15 a night. This usually will cover breakfast and dinner too. You can negotiate lunch for a little more if you like — or you can eat elsewhere. Most guesthouses offer much the same welcome and much the same food so it doesn’t really matter which you choose. Often if you’re in a car with Tajiks whether through hitchhiking or other means they’ll take you a guesthouse they know of. And it’ll usually be a good one so don’t be too worried about scams. And even if you can’t find an official guesthouse you’ll find a friendly local who’ll let you stay at their home for a small price. 2. Hotels and hostels These can be equally budget-friendly if you choose the right places. Some hotels are very expensive but spots such as Pamir Hotel in Murghab offer affordable stays starting at around $15 USD a night. Some smaller towns such as Jelondy a popular hot spring spot for locals also offer hotel stays for around $10 USD. Generally speaking if a town is a popular vacation spot for Tajiks there will be a cheap hotel. Hostels are a good cheap option in bigger towns and cities and especially in Dushanbe. Green House Hostel in particular is a fantastic affordable hub and is packed with travelers. It’s an excellent place to team up with others to save on transport costs. 3. Camping Your third option for accommodation is camping. In some ways Tajikistan is very camper friendly. I’m not sure what the actual laws are on wild camping but I’d be very surprised if any exist. Although I didn’t do so myself I met many people who camped in the wild and none of them encountered any trouble. You should of course follow the normal rules of wild camping don’t camp in the same place for more than one night don’t camp on private land without permission and don’t camp in cities. You should also research whether there are any dangers in the particular area you’re keen to camp. But otherwise you will not draw any attention since camping is very well tolerated here. Moreover guesthouses and hotels will often let you pitch your tent on their land for only $2 or $3 USD. Note the harsh weather conditions can often make camping an unpleasant experience. Because much of Tajikistan lies at such a high elevation the temperatures can be unpleasant and even dangerous — and the ground in some conditions can be too tough to push tent pegs into. So you should be careful when planning where you want to camp. Food As I’ve mentioned you’ll likely eat most of your meals in guesthouses. These will often consist of flat bread salad soup and endlessly flowing cups of tea. Other popular edible offerings include plov a pilaf-style rice dish with meat and vegetables and manti steamed lamb dumplings. Outside of guesthouses you’ll find a more varied and versatile selection of food such as kebabs and fried noodles. You can get your mouth around all of these morsels for low prices in local cafeterias. The food is tasty and filling and it comes in big portions for less than $2 USD. If you eat at a more up-market restaurant you’ll be paying closer to $5 USD. Takeaway stands in bigger towns and cities sell kebabs and samsas which are similar to Indian samosas often for around $1 USD while outdoor markets are an excellent place to buy fresh fruit and vegetables — along with special pickles candies and more — for very cheap prices. A quick tip on food bring hand sanitizer and toilet paper! Everyone gets sick in Tajikistan. I have the world’s strongest stomach and even I got sick on three separate occasions. You should also wash your hands as much as possible and avoid putting them into your mouth after handling money. And don’t drink the tap water! Hiking If you hire a private guide from an agency it can be expensive. Some people pay up to $100 USD a day for a hiking guide. But there’s no need to do this. Instead simply ask at your guesthouse for a local hiking guide. The people who live in these towns and villages know the areas extremely well. They know all the paths passes and landscapes. And for only a few dollars these unofficial guides will take you to and through the mountains for as long as you like. Whether you want a day hike or a multiday expedition there’ll be someone in the village who can take you there. I hiked for an entire day in Bulunkul for less than $10 USD and went on a two-day hike in Darshai for less than $25 USD per day. There are very few marked routes in Tajikistan. Some are marked on maps.me but there’s very little of the infrastructure that you’ll find in other countries. So while you can hike independently it’s essential you take a good map a good compass and good equipment — and that you know what you’re doing! Make sure you carry a refillable water bottle along with water purification tables — this will save you money too. Are there any other things to see in Tajikistan? Pretty much everyone who travels to Tajikistan does so for the hiking and mountain scenery so I wouldn’t recommend going all the way there if your interest isn’t piqued by peaks. That said there are a small number of other things to do Museums Dushanbe has a few small museums. The three most notable are the National Museum the Museum of Antiquities and the Museum of Musical Instruments. These cost between $1 and $5 USD so they’re a good idea if you’re looking for something to pass the time inexpensively. Other small towns and cities have small local-interest museums. Rudaki Park Central Asian cities are awash with beautiful parks. And Rudaki Park is one of the best. It’s a great way to people-watch and it’s beautifully lit after sunset. But best of all it’s free! Outdoor Markets There are food markets everywhere which make for another great free activity. Walking tours Some hostels offer walking tours which can be a nice way to see the city. These are usually pay-what-you-like so you don’t have to spend much money. Frequently Asked Questions about Tajikistan Where should I get my currency? ATMs are notoriously unreliable in Tajikistan so make sure you bring enough US dollars to cover your whole trip. Yes some ATMs will work but finding them can be a chore and having cash gives you more peace of mind. Outdoor markets/bazaars offer the best exchange rates better than banks. Look for small shacks with rates written on a sign. Most tourist establishments such as hotels and guesthouses will also exchange money so it’s always easy to get your hands on Tajik somoni — but go to the small market shacks to get more money for your money. Should I barter in Tajikistan? Tajikistan is a barterers’ economy. You can negotiate and barter over prices for a whole range of things Food in a market Accommodations Campsite fees 4WD rentals Long-distance rides Hitchhiking Hiking guides Exchange rates But there are things you can’t barter over SIM cards Restaurant prices Short-distance public transport rides Your visa and flights good luck trying What’s an overall daily budget in Tajikistan? If you’re a budget traveler you can get by on an average of $45 USD or less per day depending on where you are how you’re traveling and what you like to do. Here are some figures for what you can expect to pay on average for things in USD Dorm bed in a hostel $5-15 Guesthouse with two meals and a bed $10-15 Double room in a cheap hotel $15-20 Public transport/hitchhiking per day $10-15 Restaurant meal $5 Snacks and fruit $3 A day of hiking $10 SIM card $5 *** Tajikistan will give you a hundred reasons to fall in love. Whether it’s a full cup of tea in a stranger’s home a steaming bowl of plov or a gold-toothed smile every day is full of beautiful experiences. Most people come here for hiking amid the peaks and mountain lakes. And rightly so. But upon leaving what they’ll remember most is the warmth the hospitality and the unending kindness. It’s often true that poorer countries offer the richest welcomes. And that’s exactly the case here. You’ll leave Tajikistan feeling better than when you arrived. So don’t let the inaccurate rumors of costly travel deter you. Not only is Tajikistan possible on a budget it’s better that way. Paul McDougal is a professional writer from the United Kigdom.

You’ve inspired many of my fave trips! Just wanted to say that I think you should have added some kind of safety information on this post. My good friend Jay was killed on a cycling trip in Tajikistan along with his girlfriend and a few older European travelers in 2018. At the time it was considered a very safe destination but I believe many governments have changed their opinion. It was an act of terrorism not an accident. I travel a lot and understand that one isolated case isn’t always the experience of others. That being said I would be remiss if I didn’t at least leave this comment. I’m know Tajikistan is 99.9% amazing people like the rest of the world. To everyone out there – enjoy the trip and be safe. Reply Arne February 12 2020 at 429 am Quite a nice read. As a part of a school project I am actually going down to Kazakhstan to have a look at what the cotton industry have done to the Aral sea. And while I am in the area I was planning to take a hike to Tajikistan as well. There’s quite a lot of wrong information about the country online – but this article seem to be quite accurate compared to what other things I’ve heard from locals. Reply Steve Rohan March 2 2020 at 1159 pm I visited Aral Aralsk last year and it was quite depressing to see the former thriving fishing town in such a state of decay. Kazakhstan is a wonderful country though and I hope you enjoy your trip there! Reply Renuka February 13 2020 at 123 am Tajikistan is one of the countries on my wish-list for sure. As you mentioned it’s great for hiking I’d love to explore its natural beauty on foot. But yes making sure that one doesn’t end up spending a lot unnecessarily is so important. I guess a good research and planning could help. Thanks for this practical budget guide! Reply Devesh May 1 2020 at 311 am The Picture you posted Under Accommodation Before 1. Guest House.

Travel improves our lives broadens our horizons and helps us understand the world we inhabit. Yet these are experiences few humans will ever have. As widespread as it has become in recent years travel is still a privilege afforded only to a few. That is especially true of war zones where residents are more concerned about living through the day than seeing the wonders of the world. Things we take for granted — the ability to turn on a tap and get drinkable water to flick a switch and get light to walk to the store and find food on the shelves — are rare or absent for those suffering through such conflicts. While there many places in the world that are like that today I want to talk about one in particular Syria. Lately I’ve seen a number of folks visit Syria as tourists. When asked why they usually talk about trying to highlight the good people in the country and how such places aren’t just what you see in the media.” And while both of those things are almost always true I don’t think one should visit conflict zones as a tourist — whether you’re a writer blogger or everyday Joe or Jane. I think it’s reckless and shows a complete lack of empathy and respect for the people suffering through the horrors of war. It’s self-centered. It doesn’t actually help in any real way. It usually creates a distorted picture of the situation. It’s a misuse of Western privilege. No one doubts there are wonderful people and places in Syria. In fact one of my greatest travel regrets is not having visited Syria before the conflict because friends waxed poetic about how the hospitality and openness of the locals were second to none. And the media is always more doom and gloom” than the reality on the ground. But that doesn’t change the fact that there is a continuing war going on in Syria where millions continue to be displaced and dying. While bloggers or tourists are there taking pictures hundreds of thousands are freezing. The country has been in a civil war for close to nine years. Over 400000 civilians have been killed some estimates put that number as high as 585000. That’s more than the entire population of places such as Iceland Belize the Bahamas or Malta. On top of that over 13 million people have been displaced — with half of those being forced to leave the country entirely. And many can never return due to retaliation from government forces against them or their families. And almost half of the schools in the country have been affected with one in three children unable to attend. And while ISIS has been pushed back they still have control of some areas and thanks to Trump there is also now an influx of both Turkish and Russian troops. And that’s only causing more chaos. As millions suffer through ongoing war chemical attacks and displacement visiting as a tourist and having a fun time is a horrifying idea to me. It makes those who go seem more concerned with their ego than the plight of the country. Well I just really want to see the country so fuck those who are suffering!” War zones are not tourist attractions. Bombed buildings that used to be filled with life are not backdrops for Instagram shots. While millions suffer and die just hours away or are displaced and cannot return home bloggers or tourists shouldn’t be frolicking in the places where they used to live and laugh and spend time with their children snapping pictures and having fun while giving lip service about how it’s sad to see what is happening to the country. That to me seems like a major disconnect. If someone wants to go there and report as a journalist to educate the world and try to mobilize action to stop the conflict that’s one thing. But I’ve yet to see one person who wasn’t an actual journalist from the mainstream news media do that. Instead I hear talk about how complicated” the situation is how things are being rebuilt and how everyone is happy and things are safe whitewashing the war crimes of President Assad. If you follow these accounts you get the impression the worst is behind the country. It’s not. And the fighting in Idlib is getting incredibly worse with children being greatly affected. But that’s because these bloggers are a in government-controlled territory and b likely talking to Assad supporters or those too afraid to speak out. Then there’s willful ignorance. Take the example of Drew Binsky. I’ve never met him though I do enjoy his videos. And I’m sure he’s a well-intentioned guy. But he went to Syria and when challenged about this for the same reasons I’m bringing up said and I quote I know that Syria has been in a constant state of war for nearly a decade and I choose not to make that a focus. Why? It’s a lose-lose for me because A it’s a touchy subject and B I don’t know much about the war and politics in general. In fact I can’t even tell you a thing about American politics cuz I don’t really care! I’ve spent the last 8 years on the road and I’ve purposely separated myself from any politics because I choose to spend my time doing other things that make me happy. I guess the bottom line here is that more eyeballs on my videos means more haters and we all know that haters are gonna hate! Apparently people who bring up the notion that maybe going to a war zone is not a good idea are haters. And here he admits to not knowing much about the war or caring too much about the subject. How can you visit a country torn by war and not want to learn more about it? How can you have a platform and seek to educate people and not talk about the conflict? It’s a pretty important thing! And he’s not the only one who has done this just the most well known. There have been many others. It would be hard to link to them all but they are easy to find via a Google or Instagram search. I think trips like these to war zones or repressive regimes are further examples of the lack of ethics in the online travel industry as well as look at me” vs. learn from me” writing that puts the reader second to the influencer’s own ego. Rather than using this visit as a teachable moment to expand people’s knowledge educate and talk about a dire situation they visit without thinking about that deeper impact. But against the backdrop of war egos must wait. A visit to government-controlled territory during an ongoing conflict is simply playing into the propaganda that says that the news is exaggerating the plight of the people. What gassing by the Assad regime? What war crimes? What factionalism? There’s nothing to see here right? Many of the Syrians I spoke to had even fewer kind words for those who go there. They talked of those who visit now as taking joy in others’ misery” whitewashing Assad’s crimes and Western privilege. This quote from Zaina Erhaim an exiled Syrian journalist sums up what I heard from Syrians I spoke with Besides the active war going on and tens of civilians being killed on a daily basis beside whitewashing Assad as someone who has brought life and security back using their privileged background to get released if stopped at checkpoints above all that to cross to our home where half of us are forbidden from going to as we are forced into displacement and in exile to walk above our memories and wounds in order to get some extra views is inhuman. Their blogs step on our trauma as they take smiling pictures in our streets with our destroyed homes and favorite restaurants in the background while we are prevented from going back to because we simply did our work and protested for basic rights. *** I think travel boycotts are dumb. People are not their governments. But when war is happening and millions are dying and displaced our desire to travel must wait. When Syria and these other countries are done fighting and need to be rebuilt tourism dollars are a wonderful way to help make that happen. Take Afghanistan or Iraq. While turmoil still exists there these countries are trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild. There are new governments and the society is trying to move past the conflict. There’s a functioning economy and civil society. Now is the time to visit those places. But Syria? There is still an active conflict with other nations rolling tanks through part of the country. Turkey and Russia are in conflict there and Israel recently sent missiles into Damascus. Wait until the conflict is over people aren’t dying and starving in the streets and there is hopefully some sort of brokered truce or long-lasting cease-fire. That’s when people will need our tourism dollars. If you want to help those in Syria lobby governments to try to find a way to end the conflict. Give to aid organizations like these Tight Knit Syria Doctors Without Borders International Rescue Committee Basmeh Zeitooneh Save the Children Islamic Relief USA Tahirih Justice Center Project Amal ou Salem But don’t go visit. Don’t give Assad his propaganda wins. Don’t make people think everything is fine and the world should move on. Don’t go to a place where so much suffering is going on just because you want to see it. It’s just the wrong thing to do. Travel enriches the mind and expands the soul. But it loses its charm when a place that is still shattered like glass and those around you are mired in a conflict without end.

I recently saw a few different influencers visit Syria and I was blown away by the idea. It is similar with the sponsored trips taking place in North Korea maybe 2-3 years ago and Saudi Arabia recently. It just speaks of seeking views and engagement not respect understanding or education. Glad to see someone speak out about this! Reply Agnes February 27 2020 at 1255 pm Haters are gonna hate????” I am dumbstruck truly. Reply Winston Smith February 27 2020 at 145 pm I can’t stand these moralistic opinion pieces. You don’t want to go to Syria that’s entirely ok but others are free to make their own choices and deal with the morality of it without shaming”. To then go on and recommend Iraq and Afghanistan as viable tourist destinations seems absurd or perhaps that’s because America has sanitized” the latter but didn’t manage it with the former? Reply Suzana February 27 2020 at 311 pm While I see your point I do believe that if people want to go to see first hand what is going on maybe to in fact experience the pain for themselves understand better they should be entitled to do so. I’m not a blogger or a journalist I’m a digital nomad working remotely and personally I wouldn’t choose that but others might. There are many ways and many reasons to travel. Some want to take the risk let them. I love your pieces but this one is a bit judgmental. Besides even in the middle of a storm there are day to day lives happening. In the middle of a war people help each other. If someone wants to go there and report on a few good things and ignore the bad maybe the world needs more of that. Reply Anna February 27 2020 at 500 pm Thank you for sharing this! I had to stop following Drew a couple years ago after he blew off a similar critique about visiting North Korea. It’s good to see travel bloggers like you who are responsible about where they go. Reply Kat February 28 2020 at 214 am I stopped following him a few years back when he proclaimed Egypt didn’t seem safe on his one night stay in the country just to get that passport stamp and stand on a poor camel’s back. Reply Eric February 28 2020 at 200 am Thank you for writing this Matt. As long-term travelers considering the politics and ethics of where we go is crucial to protecting our reputation in the world. I think a lot of content creators are drawn to the clicks that visiting a controversial location will contribute to their blogs or Youtube channel but you’re right — just because someone doesn’t show the broken glass in their video doesn’t mean it isn’t there. As tourists and travelers our dollars have power. As a community we need to make sure we’re using our cash to support countries that care for their people not regimes. Reply Lannie February 28 2020 at 205 am As an aid worker in Afghanistan yes. Just yes. Reply Riana Ang-Canning February 29 2020 at 529 am Thank you so much for writing this! I follow one travel blogger on Instagram who was in Syria recently and the impression I got was that everything is fine they are open for tourists it’s safe etc. And that is such a distorted reality of the country and completing ignoring the on-going conflict. I was disgusted reading Drew’s comment above. What a horrifically privileged and ignorant thing to say! To not care about politics isn’t a cool decision it’s a privilege. Many people can’t ignore politics because it affects their daily life. Thank you for this post for speaking your truth and standing up to this. It’s so important to have another voice in this conversation. Reply Kara February 29 2020 at 1126 pm Wow! I love how you just put a little dig in about Russian and Turkish troops being present because of Trump but you just leave out the part that without Obama’s Iran Deal there wouldn’t even be an ISIS! If you are going to talk politics and link to news articles it would be awesome if you actually linked to an objective news source instead of one that is openly left or right. As a longtime reader I am pretty disappointed by this article even if you make a few good points. Reply Paul March 5 2020 at 1006 am There are a lot of reasons why ISIS came into being but that Obama’s Iran Deal was one of them is rather absurd. I challenge you to draw a straight line between the two. Even people who are vehemently opposed to that deal can’t do it Reply Morris Murphy March 1 2020 at 1151 am Thank you for sharing this! I tjink I gave have a break in following Drew a couple of years ago after he blew off a similar critique about visiting North Korea. It’s good to see travel bloggers like you who are responsible about where they go. Once again thank you for this publication keep it up Reply Adam LaPlate March 1 2020 at 511 pm This is probably one of my favorite travel articles recently. I do think it is good to know and remember that not all of these disturbed countries are ‘bad’ like you said we know good people are there. But to simply treat it like a zoo and just watch while living lavishly behind the scenes seems disrespectful. I have seen some influences and media peoples going over and visiting” but only to promote action for their fundraiser or for support actions. Thank you for bringing this to light you have many more visitors to this page than I could simply impact by my own rambling word of mouth. Reply Jackie March 4 2020 at 114 pm The zoo analogy is perfect. Reply Kendrick March 1 2020 at 601 pm I usually enjoy your blog post and I’m even part of your Superstar Blogging online course. But I’d have to disagree with this finger-wagging article. If people want to travel to the safe parts of Syria like Damascus then there’s nothing wrong with that. Enjoy the country and meet the friendly locals while avoiding politics. I used to dislike Drew Binskey’s contents as well but his new ones have been awesome. I’m now a regular follower just in 2019. His adventures to many nations that you’d discourage people from travelling to were eye-opening like Somalia Libya Afghanistan South Sudan Central African Republic etc. At the very least I admire his bravery for travelling to these nations. Reply Kevin March 2 2020 at 1254 am There is no avoiding politics” — not in travel and not in anything else. Actions are political and choosing to make a profit off the tragic events of a war-torn country is low. It’s unethical and unprofessional — especially if you have no clue what is happening in the country. Reply Valerie March 4 2020 at 1126 am Excellent article. It’s given me a perspective I haven’t thought about. It’s so important to maintain empathy and respect for the people living there and suffering understanding how it feels from their point of view to see tourists who can leave the hell-hole and go back to their safe countries while they have no way out. These tourists may be well-intentioned but are not understanding how it is perceived by the very people they may be wanting to help. That intentional curiosity to find out how it seems from the other’s perspective and willingness to honor it is so essential to responsible travel. Thanks so much for writing this. Reply Jackie March 4 2020 at 113 pm Thank you for this I think it’s an important reminder in an age of increasingly affordable travel for a lot of people l’ll go because I can!” and the competitive world of social media presence. I can’t imagine visiting a place without researching or caring about the history and ensuring that the whole picture is portrayed if I share about it. That’s the best way to use such privilege- to be a voice for the oppressed not another link in the chain of suffering. Reply Paul March 5 2020 at 948 am I appreciate the sentiment here and this writer has every right to put his opinion out there. That being said I’ve been following the war since day 1 and I have some things to say that are missing from this narrative. The article says If you follow these accounts you get the impression the worst is behind the country. But that’s because these bloggers are a in government-controlled territory and b likely talking to Assad supporters or those too afraid to speak out.” 1. The only territories that are NOT in government control are a Idlib which is in the control of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham a terrorist organization that used to be called Jabhat Al-Nusra an Al-Qaeda offshoot. Don’t let the media fool you into thinking that these guys are somehow more benevolent than big bad ISIS which everyone was afraid of… they aren’t and if there is a shade of difference it’s only in degrees. b parts of the failed Rojava Kurdish north-eastern part that actually recently made a deal with the Assad government because they acknowledged they would rather be with him than at the mercy of Turkey who would ethnically cleanse them or worse and c small random pockets that the US keeps saying it needs to be in because of ISIS” despite the caliphate being dead. In other words the only place that a tourist can go safely relatively speaking is in fact government territory. That goes a long way into realizing that Assad always was the least-bad” option here since you won’t get your head chopped off for being anything other than a Sunni. Think about it… are you gonna boycott the Philipines not go to Manila because Duterte is a thug? Are you gonna cancel that trip to Yosemite National Park because Trump is a closet racist? 2. likely talking to Assad supporters” – that means that these people actually exist and have existed since the beginning of the war. At some point you need to acknowledge that people who support Assad make up a significant chunk of the population. Are their voices not relevant simply because the Syrians in exile who almost all supported the revolution through their various organizations declared it as so? I remember the war being painted as Alawites vs. everyone else when in reality the Syrian army was always majority Sunni. And after all the desertions and the military setbacks and tens of thousands of military deaths when it looked like Assad was going to lose the Syrian army STILL had people in it that remained loyal… was that out of fear? Were all these people members of the Ba’ath party? Of course not… there was some other type of loyalty that people in the West simply cannot fathom. Going to a place like Syria just because you want likes on your pics is cynical and privileged you’re right but a lot of people also travel because they want to put money into the economy help the local people out and learn about the culture in the process. Let’s face facts Assad has won the civil war and the people that remain in Syria are desperate to have some normalcy return to their lives including making some money running businesses that cater to travelers. Reply DustyJ March 9 2020 at 232 am I’m shocked and disgusted at the idea of people popping gleefully into an active warzone on holiday to go and have a look at what a war looks like! It never even occurred to me that anyone would be so callous! Honestly have people no empathy? That’s like wandering around Bergen-Belsen in 1944 taking happy-snaps or going on a coach tour across 1848 Ireland drinking champers on the bus and watching people die from the potato blight. Would you do that? Would any normal person do that? Clearly some people would do that and then post their photos of starving Irish children on their Instagram. Reply Hana March 9 2020 at 1129 am Thank you for writing this. I have been seeing these blogs and thinking the same. I agree with some of the comments above. It can be really challenging deciding which countries you are comfortable visiting in order to support the people but not the government but war-torn Syria seems like an obvious one one to avoid. Reply Sarah March 21 2020 at 1139 pm Drew is an idiot – that isn’t news. If you’re going to go to somewhere like Syria Pakistan Iran North Korea Myanmar Venezuela etc – then you have a responsibility to read up ahead of time and learn about the situation so you can make an informed decision. Syria is however a bit of a challenging one – there are certainly some parts of Syria which are not safe to visit but travelers have been going to Syrian Kurdistan pretty much without interruption for the last few years. What Drew did was not new as he would have you believe. Visiting Syrian Kurdistan in my opinion is a good thing – it helps bring tourist dollars into the economy promotes cross-cultural exchange and this area has been safe for a long time. I do get your point here Matt but not all of Syria is a warzone.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share The topic of getting scammed in Egypt need no introduction from me. In fact I have written a whole article about it a while back with my greatest passion. It was a problem I was not prepared for and so I paid the price dearly. That said I still think Egypt is one of the most unique countries you can experience. Walking through the mysterious old city of Cairo and the historic ancient ruins in this country one could only imagine oneself as Indiana Jones exploring a long-lost civilization. Theres no other country like Egypt. If you want a summary of my trip to Egypt do check out Follow me and Ill show you Egypt post but if you want a detail look at each location do stick around and Ill show you what Cairo is like. Looking for a complete itinerary for Egypt?2 Weeks Itinerary for Egypt. Table of Contents Egypt Travel Video Where to Stay in Cairo Getting to the Pyramids of Giza Visit Coptic Cairo Visit the Cairo Citadel and the Mosque of Muhhammad Ali Stroll Around the Khan-El Khalili Grand Bazaar Further Reading for Egypt Egypt Travel Video Where to Stay in Cairo After arriving in Cairo in the evening I went to a hostel I booked called Arabesque Hotel which I do not recommend. Its very old and there was not many people there. Given I got upgraded to a single room but the purpose of me staying in a hostel is to meet some people. Ultimately I did not meet anyone there and I would suggest people to go to Freedom Hostel instead which I stayed on my way out of Egypt. Very modern clean fast WiFi and I met lots of people here. Getting to the Pyramids of Giza Walking in Cairo in the early morning was a quiet and peaceful experience I did not expect from this place. I heard a lot of stories about people getting scammed by the taxi on their way to the pyramid so I was determined not to be one of them. It took me only a couple of minutes to find a taxi that are willing to turn on the meter and it costed me less than 40 EGP to go from Downtown Cairo to the Giza Pyramids. The taxi dropped me off unknowingly at the wrong entrance. The front entrance was only for big tour buses and I was refused entry by the security guards. As I was desperate a guy who was hanging out with the guards offered me to show me the right entrance. I tried my best to reject him but I also needed him to show me since I had no clue where I was. He walked me through a small village zig-zagging along the dirt roads for almost 30 minutes. Along the way he tried to get me on a camel ride for a fee. I rejected firmly and he gave up on that front. After arriving at 9 sharp the gate was still closed. At that moment I was confused. Did this guy bought me to a wrong entrance again. Turned out that year the government decided not to adjust the day light savig time and so my clock was one hour early. I waited for an hour until the gate opened. My little friend here was so anxious to get me the ticket and directed me through the security screening. I was wondering when he would show his true color. It did not take long. After walking inside the Giza area he started to guide me through each place. I told him clearly that I wanted to be alone but he wont let me go until I gave him a tip. I gave him 100 EGP at first and he refused. He wanted more! He said people gave him 300 USD and I cursed to him and say that Ill give you 300 EGP and you better get out of my face. He accepted it and tried to butter me up. I just walked away cursing and never look back at him. That said the sight was still pretty phenomenal. The pyramids were not exactly in the middle of no where as people imagined. You can see the vincinity of the crumbling Cairo on the horizon. There are 3 main pyramids in the area aligned in a line. The actual scale of the pyramids baffled me. On the left is the pyramid and me for scale. The camels are not habited in this area by nature. They are brought there by the hawkers to find tourists to carried them around. I refused to get on one when I saw how they treated them. This is the second largest pyramid the pyramid of Khafre and here is me for scale. I was not even that close to the pyramid and I was still dwarfed by it. The scattered rocks at the foot of the great pyramid of Khufu. I could totally imagine an army marching through this path! The pyramid of Khafre dwarfing everything else around it. The Sphinx was a little smaller than I previously thought. It is also fenced off so no fun photos of me with the Sphinx.  This is the closest I was able to get to the Sphinx. It was still quite a sight! Last but not least the Sphinxs ass to show you how big the acutal monument is.  I spent half a day in the area and took a taxi back to the hostel and rested for the rest of the day exhausted by all the relentless touters and hawkers. At one point one of them actually threw a scarf at me like it was free and asked for my money later. Although nothing beats the guy who started off super friendly shook hands with me and didnt let go until I buy something from him. From that point on my goal each day was to NOT GET SCAM AGAIN. Visit Coptic Cairo Today is going to be different I told myself and it did. First thing in the morning I took a metro to the Mar Gergis station near the Coptic Cairo area. Coptic Cairo is a Coptic Christian region of Cairo. A much more quiet peaceful and spiritual place than anywhere else in Cairo. The area consisted of churches. If you are a spiritual christian you will want to come here. Eventhough I am not a spiritual person I still enjoy the peacefulness of sitting without getting touted by people. The famous Hanging church. I have no idea why it is famous though so if you do please tell me.  A hidden market way under the ground level of the Old Cairo was a hidden gem I accidentally stumbled upon. There are more churches down here as well. I walked a bit further north and found a nice flea market. I was trying my best to blend in but my Asian features gave it away pretty quickly. Visit the Cairo Citadel and the Mosque of Muhhammad Ali Next up the Citadel and The Mosque of Muhhammad Ali. This is probably one of the most attractive attraction in Cairo for me. Some parts of the Citadel are used as a museum to explain the concept of Islam to travelers. Some are used as a militiary base. But the majority of structures in the Citadel are mosques. This is the Mosque of Muhammad Ali the biggest of them all. The inside was decorated with scriptures and chandeliers. People said the Mosque of Muhammad Ali is a disappointment compared to the Blue Mosque in Turkey. I had never seen neither so my mind was still blown away by the sheer size of the place. The Citadel is also the perfect place to see Cairo from the top. It was quite a sight to behold. Some people think that the mosque was not well maintained but I like it this way. It looks more interesting and mysterious then if it were cleaned. Stroll Around the Khan-El Khalili Grand Bazaar After spending long hours at the citadel I decided to finish off my day with a stroll in the historic Khan-El Khalili grand bazaar. This is a good place to buy a souvenir but you will have to bargain quite a bit. Whatever the price they give half that and walk away if they cant match it. If the shop owner dont give in just walk away and some other stores will offer you a lower price. They all sell similar stuff here. There are also plenty of coffee shop for you to sit and enjoy a little Shisha. Since I am not a big fan of shopping when I travel I simply sat in one of the cafe nearby sipped a cup of Turkish coffee and watched people. Around 8PM that day I went to the train station bought my sleeper train ticket to Aswan hopped on the train at 915PM and slept my way through the ancient land as I awaited my arrival to the remote temple of Abu Simbel. Stay tuned for my journey down to the border of Sudan. Continue Reading the Next Part2 Days in Aswan and Abu Simbel.

I’ve been to the country twice and always leave wanting more. There’s something deeply special about this place. Stretching over 2800 kilometers 1700 miles and home to over 56 million people you could easily spend months here and still not see everything. Heck just driving from one end of the country to the other would take several days. Though there are hundreds of things to see and do in South Africa here’s a list of what I think are the must-see and must-do activities while you’re here 1. Go on a safari Most people come to South Africa to go on a safari — and for good reason. It’s home to some of the best game drives in the world and you’ll want to spend at least a couple of nights in one of the hundreds of national parks. There’s truly nothing like it. The most well-known safari destination is Kruger National Park which has incredible diversity and tons of amazing wildlife including the Big Five” lions leopards elephants rhinoceroses and Cape buffalo. I went to Kruger a few years back and it was everything I’d expected and more. Although you can drive yourself around the park I actually recommend using a guide because they’ll be much better at spotting animals and will also give you heaps info about them their habitat and the park itself. Since this is one of those once in a lifetime” experiences it’s worth spending the money to get a knowledgeable guide. While Kruger is the most famous safari destination there are dozens of other options across South Africa. Here are a few I recommend Hluhluwe and iMfolozi National Park – Located in the east of the country and is known for its rhino populations. Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park – On the border with Botswana in the north it’s known for its black-maned lions. Addo Elephant National Park – Near Port Elizabeth on the south coast this is a great choice for self-drive safaris. Pilanesburg National Park & Game Reserve – Home to the Big 5 and is doable in a day trip from Johannesburg if you’re short on time. Safaris are so common in South Africa that pretty much every price point and budget is covered. Accommodation options range from budget-friendly campsites to upscale guesthouses and resorts. 2. Visit Cape Town Cape Town is the most popular destination in South Africa — and for good reason. It’s a vibrant multicultural city with lively bars delicious food great weather lots of nature and hiking nearby. In addition to the city’s amazing beaches the waterfront is bursting with things to do as well. There’s a lot to do in the city so check out this entire post I wrote on what to do while you are there! 3. Go Surfing Both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean coasts of South Africa offer world-class surfing. Jeffrey’s Bay on the south coast near Port Elizabeth is the most famous surfing destination in South Africa and offers big waves and multiple breaks. There are also a number of good surfing locations near Cape Town including Dungeons in Hout Bay and a number of others further south on the Western Cape such as Long Beach. If you’re a beginner Durban is a great option for surfing lessons because of the reliable waves and warm water of the Indian Ocean. Expect to pay around 500 ZAR per person for a 2-3 hour lesson. 4. Learn About Apartheid You can’t visit South Africa without learning about the horror of apartheid a system of institutionalized racial segregation which cast its shadow over the country from the 1940s all the way into the 1990s. Opened in 2001 the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg does an excellent job of highlighting apartheid’s history and legacy. While in Johannesburg be visit the Constitutional Court. It stands on the site of a former political prison and you can tour some of the prison ruins and learn more about the many political prisoners who were unjustly detained here. Also be sure to visit the District Six Museum in Cape Town. It’s a memorial to the people who lived in the area in the 1970s who were forced to relocate so that white citizens could move in. It’s both sobering and illuminating. 7. Visit Robben Island When it comes to learning about apartheid you’ll want to also plan a trip to Robben Island. Located just four miles off the coast of Cape Town Robben Island was a maximum-security prison until 1996. During the apartheid era many political prisoners were sent to Robben Island. This includes Nelson Mandela who spent 18 years behind bars on Robben Island. The prison is now a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most important cultural sites in the country. Conditions at the prison were incredibly harsh with many prisoners forced into hard labor in the limestone quarry. They were also made to sleep on the stone floors of their cells without a bed as well. Today former prisoners are tour guides and they shed light on what life was like here during apartheid. You’ll be able to see Mandela’s cell and take a bus ride around the island to see the prisoner’s graveyard as well as the quarry where Mandela and other prisoners were forced to work. Ferries operate 3 times a day starting at 9am a 4th ferry operates during the summer season. Admission is 320 ZAR for adults and 200 ZAR for anyone under 18 which includes the ferry ride. Expect to spend at least four hours here including the tour and getting to/from the island. 5. Hike the Drakensberg Mountains The Drakensberg region near the east coast is home to the highest mountain range in the country with rugged green peaks sandstone cliffs and deep valleys. There are lots of trails ranging from casual walks to strenuous climbs and plenty of options for both day hikes and multi-day hikes. Some of the popular routes include the following Rainbow Gorge Easy and beautiful two-hour trail in the Cathedral Peak area. Ploughman’s Kop A half-day trail with a steep climb but beautiful rock pools along the way so you can cool off with a dip. Chain Ladders Hike A challenging one-day hike including ladders attached to the rock face. Cathedral Peak Best climbed with a guide this hike can be split across two days with a night spent camping in a cave to break up the hikes. Giant’s Cup Trail Typically done a five-day hike but not overly strenuous. 6. See African Penguins Part of the Table Mountain National Park and a short drive from Cape Town the Boulders Penguin Colony is home to several thousand African penguins. Fun fact they’re also known as jackass penguins because the noises they make sound like a donkey braying. Unfortunately they’re an endangered species as a result of human impacts like pollution oil spills and habitat destruction. For that reason you aren’t allowed to walk on the beach where the penguins breed but you can watch them from the nearby viewing platforms. There is also a raised boardwalk that starts at the Boulders Visitor Centre which will let you get up close to the penguins. Just keep in mind that they are wild animals and the beach is their home not yours. Be sure to keep your distance and don’t try to feed them or pet them. As cute as they are they’re still wild animals. 8. Take a Road Trip South Africa is an awesome road trip destination. The most famous route is the Garden Route which takes you along coastal cliffs and through forests and mountain ranges. Stretching along the south-central coast from Mossel Bay in the west to Storms River in the east the Garden Route is only around 200km 125 miles long but is full of beaches lakes and lagoons. If you are feeling adventurous you can stop at Bloukrans Bridge the highest bridge in Africa and go bungee jumping there. Expect to pay around 1400 ZAR $95 USD per person. The beautiful beaches of Plettenberg Bay on the Indian Ocean are also a worthwhile Garden Route stop. There are other popular road-trip routes in South Africa such as the Panorama Route in Mpumalanga which winds around the Blyde River Canyon or the Wild Coast route for exploring dramatic coastal landscapes. You can also pick a road-trip route that takes in several national parks as there are quite a few scattered around the country where you can self-drive through the park to see the wildlife. 9. Go Wine Tasting South Africa’s climate is perfect for grape growing and the country produces award-winning white red and sparkling wines. The wine industry here dates back to the seventeenth century and there are hundreds of wineries to be found and sampled of course. In the Cape Winelands region not far from Cape Town Stellenbosch has over 150 wineries in a very small area while a bit further away Franschhoek not only has over 50 vineyards but also some of South Africa’s best restaurants. You can do a wine tour that will take you to several different or you can stay in one for a night or two many have guest accommodations. If you don’t have a vehicle and want to take a tour expect to pay at around 1000 ZAR per person for a half-day tour of the region and its wineries. Many hostels run their own tours to the region or have partnerships with local tour guides who can take you as well. Be sure to shop around for the best deal! 10. Explore the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve A frequent stop on the way to or from Kruger Blyde River Canyon is the third largest canyon in the world. It’s particularly lush and green compared to the Grand Canyon and also has extremely deep sheer cliffs. There are numerous natural rock formations and other natural features in this UNESCO-listed reserve including Pinnacle Rock God’s Window and Bourke’s Luck Potholes. You can also find ancient rock art in the Echo Caves. There are several hiking trails as well as abseiling mountain biking and white-water rafting. 11. Go Whale Watching South Africa is generally considered to be one of the best places in the world to go whale watching. If you’re visiting between June and November you’ll have an excellent chance of spotting Southern right whales Bryde’s whales and orcas. The town of Hermanus located 120km southeast of Cape Town is the base for many of the best whale-watching companies in the country. Some reputable companies to check out are Southern Right Charters Hermanus Whale Cruises Xplora Tours Expect to pay around 950 ZAR for a two-hour tour. Drinks and snacks are usually included and discounts are often available for students seniors and children. be sure to book in advance as tours sell out fast since there is a limited window. 13. Go Scuba Diving If you love to dive or want to learn head to Cape Town. The diving here is world-class thanks to the mixing of warm and cold ocean currents. Here you’ll find rocky shores lots of reefs and kelp forests. There are also lots of wrecks on both sides of the peninsula too. Expect to pay around 1450 ZAR for a one-tank dive including equipment rental and 6600 ZAR for your PADI certification if you’re a new diver. For more wrecks head to Port Elizabeth which is on the coast halfway between Cape Town and Durban. There are several interesting wrecks to explore here including the Haerlem a scuttled navy frigate and the Doddington which wrecked in the 18th century. It’s also a great area for diving with sharks. For something more unique visit Port St. Johns to witness the sardine migration. It occurs every June with four miles of water thick with sardines! You can book multi-day diving tours to see the sardines with most lasting 5-6 days cand costing 30000 ZAR per person. Sodwana Bay on the border with Mozambique is another top location to see healthy coral reefs as well as lots of fish and marine life. *** With its perfect weather incredible wildlife award-winning wine and culinary delights South Africa is an underrated destination that deserves your attention. It’s a country I never get tired of visiting and is one of the most beautiful countries I’ve ever been to. You just can’t help but fall in love with it — no matter your interests.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share Seville the fourth largest city in Spain is a city with an impressive historical value due to its long history dated back to the time of the Romans 2000 years ago. From exploring a gigantic palace to learning the history of bullfighting Seville offers countless activities for you to do. Seville was the second city I visited right after Madrid and if you think Madrid is already laid-back try visiting Seville. With its countless parks artistic buildings and the always-sunny weather you may be here for days before you see everything. Looking for a complete itinerary to Spain?10 Days Travel Itinerary for Spain Table of Contents Seville Things to Do Map Spain Travel Video How to Get to Seville How to Get Around Seville Where to Stay in Seville Travel Insurance What to Do in Seville Geek out at the Plaza de Espana Relax in the Maria Luisa Park Stare at the Cathedral in wonder Walk around the Alcázar of Seville Check out the Metropol Parasol Eat Tapas by the River in Triana Digital Nomad friendly cafe Further Reading for Spain Show More Seville Things to Do Map Spain Travel Video How to Get to Seville From Madrid if you are looking for a cheap and reliable way to go to Seville you can take a bus directly to Seville which should take you no more than 6 hours. Otherwise a fast train is another good option but it will be more expensive. If you are taking a bus from Madrid be sure to ask your hostel for the bus schedule. Once you know which bus you want to take go to the Estación Sur bus station an hour earlier and get your ticket sorted. I went with the Socibus.es since it was the cheapest one and it ran that day. You can also go with FlixBus as they are cheap reliable and run widely throughout Europe. How to Get Around Seville Seville can easily be done on foot. If the heat is unbearable then you can hop on the tram that runs throughout the city. Where to Stay in Seville Budget - Sevilla Kitsch Hostel Art - 18 USD/Night Dorm Mid-Range - The Boutike Hostel Mid-Range - 63 USD / Night Double/Twin Room Daily Budget Traveling here on average will cost you more than traveling in most countries out there. You can expect to spend around 45 - 65 USD per day per person with food accommodation and transportation. Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling which is leaning more toward the budget side of things. If you want to stick to this budget expect to sleep in dorms eat out only a few times and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation which often times involves walking. Travel Insurance If you are looking for travel insurance to go along with your trip to Spain I would recommend WorldNomads.com which is what I use to look for a travel insurance that fits my kind of adventure. They have a simple and flexible search system that allowed me to find the right insurance for the right amount of time at an affordable price in seconds. If you need travel insurance give WorldNomads.com a try. Get a Quote from World Nomads What to Do in Seville Geek out at the Plaza de Espana This is possibly one of the best attraction in Seville. A gigantic red palace located near the Maria Luisa Park. Its vast space unique architectural design and its humongous size made it a must-see place in Seville. To make this place even better for you it is known that this place was used to shoot a scene in one of the prequels of the movie Star Wars! Usually a place this beautiful is usually crowded with tourists but this was not the case for me. Possibly due to its vast space and an open-air style building it felt like I had the whole place to myself. Relax in the Maria Luisa Park Across from the Plaza de Espana is a beautiful park where you can hide from the raging sun to be among the beautiful nature and chirrping birds. Be sure to observe every detail of the structure you run into in the park from the beautiful bridges over tiny canals to a resting stop that looked almost like it was taken straight from a fairy tale. Stare at the Cathedral in wonder As you walk around the old town you cant mistaken this cathedral for anything else. This gothic-style church is the third-largest church in the world. Even without going inside you can appreciate the intricate detail and hard work that went into bringing this massive piece of magnificent to life. I was unable to go inside due to some event that took place when I was there so if you have a chance to go in dont hesitate. I heard the detail inside are even more breathtaking. Walk around the Alcázar of Seville A little bit south of the Cathedral lies another impressive palace called Alcázar of Seville. Within that palace is heaven.. or at least a park that resembles it. Its lush green vegetation white walls and beautiful floras contradict the exterior of the palace. I spent at least 2 hours in here just walking around and getting lost in the park. Check out the Metropol Parasol To spice things up a little lets take a break from all the old structure and marvel at the modern creation that is the Metropol Parasol. I found that this is where the cool kids like the hang out chilling out with friends skateboarding etc. Even though this building is drastically different in style compared to all the other buildings around it surprisingly it did not seem so to me. Somehow it blended in very well with the city. Eat Tapas by the River in Triana People usually go into Seville old town to find something to eat even though they know that it will be overpriced and crowded with tourists. If you are looking for a more laid back and authentic experience all you have to do is cross the river to Triana and eat at one of the many tapas bars along the river like all the locals do. Las Golondrinas 2 is a good place if you crave authentic tapas for a bargain. Digital Nomad friendly cafe Finding a cafe where you can sit and work without getting a death stare from the owner in Spain outside major cities has proved to be challenging. Due to the culture here most cafes are a hybrid between a tapas bar and a coffee shop. Since they also serve food as well as coffee it is uncommon for people to sit in one of these tapas bars and work away. I was unable to find a good local cafe here for work unfortunately so I would suggest you stick to StarBucks or stay at your hostels. A location of a Starbucks where you can work from.

It’s often considered one of the most haunted cities in the entire world — and anyone who has been will be hard pressed to argue! When I was there a few years ago I took part in some of the city’s many ghost tours. And there are a lot to choose from! Regardless of whether you believe in ghosts or not these tours take you on an adventure that not only teaches you a part of Edinburgh’s history but also leaves you feeling just a little weird.” Or if you are like me scared shitless. While I hate horror movies because I always find them too unbelievable as Alfred Hitchcock said a good fright comes from what people don’t see or know. When I finished my ghost tours I was so spooked that I refused to sleep with the light off that night. The only other time I felt such unease was after I saw The Blair Witch Project. Whether you’re looking for a fright or just want to learn about this historic city’s spooky past you’ll definitely want to take a ghost tour during your visit. Here are the best ghost tours in Edinburgh to help you make the most out of your next visit 1. City of the Dead City of the Dead is one of the top-rated ghost tours in Edinburgh and it’s the company I went with during my first visit to the vaults. The underground vaults were built in 1788 and used as storage space and workshops for businesses near the South Bridge. However the bridge was poorly constructed and water from the surface would leak down into the vaults. The vaults were then abandoned in 1795 and became slums turning into a red-light district with countless brothels and pubs. Additionally the city’s poor called these vaults home. The rooms were cramped and dark and had poorly circulated air and no sunlight running water or sanitation. Crime was widespread but by 1820 the leaking became so intense that even the squatters had left. The story I remember most is of a girl and her mother. The little girl felt someone grab her hand. Thinking it was her mom she grabbed back. But the hand according to the story felt weird” and slowly kept squeezing her hand until it hurt. When the girl said You’re hurting me” the mother said I’m over here honey.” The guide moving the flashlight to the girl found that she was standing alone. Who held her hand? How did she get separated? I don’t know. Maybe they made the story up. Or all the other stories for that matter. But moving through the vaults in the dark with your mind in overdrive creates an atmosphere of unease that you want on a ghost tour. Of course the guy jumping out of the corner in the dark doesn’t help at all either! +44 131-225-9044 cityofthedeadtours.com. Tours are available daily at 330pm and 830pm limited hours in the winter check the website for availability. Tours last around 90 minutes and are not suitable for children under 12. Tickets are 13 GBP per person. 2. Free Ghost Tour When it comes to free haunted walking tours this is your best choice in the city. Free Ghost Tours offers daily tours that depart from the Royal Mile covering all the major sites and stories of the city such as the real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the haunted graveyard with trials and the Westport Murderers. If you’re not looking for a terrifying experience this is a good tour for you as it’s suitable for children.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share In August 2015 I decided to leave a comfortable home in Bangkok and embarked on a 3 months journey to Europe camping and sleeping on peoples couches. Within this 3 months I have seen 4 countries hiked the Swiss and the French Alps slept on the floor of a ferry to Corsica celebrated my birthday with a German rap battle in Dresden went all hipster in Berlin got my bag stolen in Cologne watched a sunset on top of Sacromonte Spain and experienced one of the most dramatic time of my life. Following the success of my Follow me and Ill show you New Zealand post I have decided to continue this tradition and captured photos of my back throughout Europe. From Spain to Switzerland to France and ended in Germany.. Follow me and I’ll show you Europe Table of Contents Madrid - Spain Seville - Spain Granada - Spain Lugano - Switzerland Lucerne - Switzerland Bern - Switzerland Zurich - Switzerland St Gallen - Switzerland Appenzell - Switzerland Swiss National Park - Switzerland Matterhorn - Switzerland Lauterbrunnen - Switzerland Lorrach - Germany Lyon - France Chamonix - France Grenoble - France Corsica - France Avignon - France Bordeaux - France Mont Saint Michel - France Paris - France Stuttgart - Germany Munich - Germany Erlangen - Germany Cologne - Germany Berlin - Germany Luneburg - Germany Leipzig - Germany Dresden Videos Show More Madrid - Spain I landed in Madrid in the early morning and the first thing I did was to join a free walking tour and explored the city. Thank god I did that because I did not have a lot of time in Madrid and the walking tour showed me all the attractions in one go. I really hit the ground running when I arrived in Madrid. That same night after a 3 hours walking around the city in the heat of mid summer Spain I joined a pub crawl and went on a drinking spree. Needless to say I completely wasted the next day. Seville - Spain After Madrid I took a bus to Seville and explored the city by foot. I love European cities. Everything is in walking distance! This is possibly my favourite place in Seville the Plaza de Espana. The scale of the palace is just mindblowing. As I was walking around the palace it felt almost like I had the whole place to myself. I think due to its open-air corridors and vast space the place never felt crowded at anytime. Did you know that Star Wars was shot here? Me neither but dont get too excited though. It was used as one of the scene in the Attack of the Clones prequel not the new one. Granada - Spain Granada is my favourite city in Spain hands down. The laid-back culture the cheap tapas and the nature will make you want to stay here forever. As I had found out by experience the best way to see the city and meet new people in Spain is to join the free walking tour. We hiked up to the caves of Sacromonte and learned how the people living in the caves had come to be. After a few days exploring the city it was time to go out and explore the surrounding areas. Me and a couple of friends went out and hiked the waterfall trail in Monachil. We found a nice refreshing pool of water at the end to chill out and freshen up before making our way back. The trail is definitely not for people who have acrophobia. One of the person in our group backed out at the last minute because he did not feel comfortable walking along the side of a cliff. The trail itself was very easy but the terrain can get real rough sometimes. At one point we had to hang our bodies from the side of a cliff to continue on. Last day in Granada me and a couple of friends decided to grab a few beers and went up the Sacromonte again and watched the sunset. This is possibly the best place to experience sunset in all of Spain! Lugano - Switzerland From Spain I flew directly to Zurich to made it in time for my friends road trip. We took off to Lugano and stayed at my friends place which was 3 steps away from Lake Lugano. I had never associate Switzerland with hot climate but man was the sun burning furiously when I was there at the end of August. We could not go a day without swimming in the lake. A little morning stroll as we make our way across to Italy on foot. One of the benefit of having an open border between your neighbouring countries is that you can literally walk to another country. This was me walking from Switzerland to Italy. It only took us 15 minutes. Lucerne - Switzerland After 15 years I was finally back in Lucerne my childhood favourite city. For some reason I remember nothing about my childhood travel except Lucerne. I remembered this bridge vividly when I was here 15 years ago. I even remembered the stories told by our guide about the fire that were supposedly caused by a discarded cigarette. I even remembered where our tour bus parked 15 years ago! It was like a dejavu walking around Lucerne again. Check out the Church of St. Leodegars interior. Bern - Switzerland After spending half day in Lucerne we decided to spend another half in Bern. We made our way to see the Bern bear to realize that the bear had been moved to some other town. The weather wasnt so great but that never stop me from taking a photo of my back! . Zurich - Switzerland I couldnt resist passing these mountains without stopping and taking a photo of it. Switzerland really do take your breath away at every turn. Possibly one of the best lunch spot in Zurich. St Gallen - Switzerland Since we had a one day pass we decided to explore other cities a little bit. In the early morning we went to St Gallen. It was okay with a bunch of nice churches and streets but what we were looking for was some nature. Appenzell - Switzerland We sure found nature in Appenzell! Me and Hayden a friend I met during the road trip decided to find some hikes to do in the area. From Appenzell we took a train to Wasserauen and hiked to Seealpsee lake beautiful emerald lake located in the valleys in Appenzell. The hike was not hard per se but very steep. It took us around an hour to reach the lake. We were very impressed with the trail. We did not expect it to be so quiet and the nature to be so untouched because it was not far from the tourist attraction and the hike was only an hour but we sure got what we asked for. We found a little wooden church tugged away in the wild forest. A good hike is defined by the trail and the reward it gives at the end. A good trail always rewarded us with a jaw-dropping scenery at the end. Always. I can not but feel small and insignificant when standing face-to-face with mother nature. Even with half the valley covered in fog it was still beautiful. Can you imagine looking at this valley on a clear day? Swiss National Park - Switzerland After a week living cozily with my Swiss friend it was time to shake off that fondue weight and do some intense hiking. Me and Hayden bought a 4-day pass and roamed the land freely looking for an epic hike to do. We started off at the Swiss National Parkin Zernez. As soon as we arrived we setup our tent and summited Alp da Munt. It was a nice day and I did not want it to go to waste because from my experience hiking in New Zealand a good weather dont last. Im glad we did it because it was pouring cats and dogs the next day and we ended up exploring Zernez instead. The next mountain we tackled was the Munt la Schera. The day started out cold and wet but we decided to not waste another day hiding and powered through it. The trail took us real close to the border. We were only a few cows away from Italy. It took us 3 - 4 hours to reach the summit of Munt la Schera which stood at 2378m above sea level. As we approached the top we met this Swiss woman from Zurich who enthusiastically offered us chocolates and cheered us for reaching the summit together. Its this kind of genuine interaction that made me fall in love with hiking. It was so windy and cold we had to hide behind a rock as we ate our energy bars bit by bit like a Squirrel. This was me conquering the summit of Munt la Schera. We could not handle the cold any longer so we decided to hike down before another wave of clouds comes. From the summit onward the trail was simple and mostly exposed. I was so glad that it did not rain after that. If you like nature and want to avoid the crowd Swiss national park is another good option. Matterhorn - Switzerland After the Swiss National Park me and Hayden went to Zermatt to do some hiking around Matterhorn. We were bombarded with throngs and throngs of tourists. It was a shock coming from the Swiss National Park so we decided to get out of the city as fast as we could. We decided to combine multiple trails together and created a full day hike. We started off at 8 AM in Zermatt and hiked toward Furi. Me and Hayden were somehow split up. I was following someone who I thought was Hayden but when I realized it was not him it was too late. Thankfully we divided our food in half so we were able to continue our hike separately without having one starve to death. The first 3 hours I spent hiking from Zermatt to Schwarzsee Paradise. From Schwarzsee Paradise I continued up toward Matterhorn. I was on the fence about hiking to the Matterhorn base camp Hörnlihütte mountain hut at first since it would add another 3 hours to an already long hike 9 hours. In the end I said F*ck it. Im only here so often. How often do I get a chance to see Matterhorn up close? And off I went. In my mind I was planning to take a cable car back down after the hike and call it a day but that did not happen. As I was climbing I tried my best to keep my head down because I would have given up already if I saw how far the hut was. I eventually arrived at the base camp at 1 pm tired but still energetic enough to inspect the Matterhorn up close. The hut stood at 3260m above sea level and to think that I just climbed from Zermatt which was 1620m high in 5 hours was extraordinary. After half an hour at the hut I came down and instead of going back the same way I decided to tackle the Glacier trail which took me down to the glacier. It was a hell of a view from down here. After 3 hours walking along the Glacier trail I finally reached the stop that I was suppose to take the cable car down. Somehow the adventure found me again as I realized that the cable car was already close just 10 minutes before I arrived. The situation did not look any better as the sun started to set. I quickly scanned the area and found a trail that goes directly to Zermatt BUT it would take another 3 hours! I was running out of food and water and I was losing daylight every minute and so I decided to bite the bullet and ran down as fast as I could. After a 9 hours hike running is usually not what I would do but I had no choice. I arrived back in Zermatt at 8PM and found Hayden waiting for me. I was gone for so long he almost reported me missing to the police. Lauterbrunnen - Switzerland After a crazy day in Zermatt we decided to take it slow this time and went on a little stroll in Lauterbrunnen. The valleys in Lauterbrunen are perfect for base jumping and as we made our way to the Staubbach Falls we saw a couple of base jumpers free falling from the cliff. One of them I couldnt for the life of me find where he/she went! Another day another hike. This time we went with a 2 hours hike to the small uphill town Wegnen. After about an hour it rained on us hard and we had to abort the hiking mission and go back to the hostel. The next day we bid farewell as I have to meet my friends in Basel and so we went separate ways. Lorrach - Germany After Lauterbrunen I decided to make my way toward France and in between that I stopped at Basel and crossed the border to Lorrach in Germany to meet my friends Julia and Jannis. We all met in Vietnam on a train to Ninh Binh and now we met again in Germany. Oh the randomness of traveling! Lyon - France After 2 weeks in Switzerland I decided that it was time to move on to my next country France. I took a train from Basel to Lyon and couch-surfed at my good friend house Aurelie whom I met in Australia 2 years ago. This was her showing my around the Ancient Roman Theatre near the hilltop Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière. Theres nothing like having a local to show you around. You got to see how they live and all the hidden gems only the city dwellers know. There are hundreds of hidden passages weave through the old quarter of Lyon. These were a few of them. I spent almost a week living like a local in Lyon before heading to my next destination Chamonix. Chamonix - France I was finally back in the mountain exactly where I belonged. After a week in a city it was great to be back in nature again. The weather was clear so I decided to make use of that day to the max and combined 2 trails to create a one full day hike. I combined the Grand Balcon trail and the Lac Brac trail together creating an 8 hours hike in total. The problem was I was there at the beginning of the low season and so all the cable cars were closed and I had to walk the entire length of the cable car which added 3 - 4 hours to the hike. Since I was there at the beginning of Autumn the colors were extra vivid in the mountains. I have never hike during Autumn before so this was a nice surprise. I kinda like the French Alps more. The mountains here are more epic for some reason. But Mont Blanc is not as iconic as Matterhorn. Mont Blanc looks like a little blob being carried by other mountains whereas Matterhorn is its own beast. The Grand Balcon is definitely one of the trail I recommend you to do if you are short on time. It will give you an unmatched view of the whole mountain range as you see in the photos. Its not all roses and sunshine though especially when hiking with me. This was the moment I stepped on an massive ant nest! Hundreds of ants were crawling on my right foot at the moment the photo was taken. From the end of the Grand Balcon trail comes the Lac Branc or White Lake in English. This is one of the most photogenic location around this area. The lake when theres no wind creates the perfect reflection of the mountain range. It was so calm and peaceful I could stay there for days. In fact I stayed there for hours which costed me greatly as you will learn about it in the next photo. It was 5pm when I started to make my way down from Lac Branc. I thought I would be back in Argentiere in time to catch the last train back to Chamonix. Dont get me wrong I was at the train station right on time. I waited and the train never came. As it turned out only the bus runs that day for some reasons and I ended up missing the bus because I was waiting at the train station! In the end I had to walk 2 hours back in the dark on the side of the mountainous road. It was so dangerous Im glad I survived to tell about it. I almost collapse when I arrived in Chamonix. It was 10pm and I found the nearest bar ordered a steak and devoured the hell out of it while watching the Rugby World Cup. It was a great day! I decided to extend my stay in Chamonix to rest and to get on to a cable car to the top of Aiguille du midi and see the Mont Blanc up close. It was magnificent! Grenoble - France With great friends come great opportunities. I surfed another couch in Grenoble this time with my friend Delphine who works as a guide in Grotte de Choranche one of the most unique cave in France displaying one of the thinnest stalactites I have ever seen! So delicate.. so fragile. I took this opportunity to tagged along with her to work as she personally showed me around the cave. What an awesome job she has! After the personal tour I went on my own and hike the canyons to Pont en Royans another small town with buildings hanging out off a cliff. Corsica - France I took a ferry from Toulon to Ajaccio Corsica after Grenoble. It was an overnight ferry and the cabin would cost me 90 Euros extra. I did not want to spend that much money for a night in the ferry so I decided to rough it and slept on the floor. I had a great night sleep! I had heard about this ruin in the west coast of Corsica called Tour de la Parata and so the next day I decided to go to the ruin.. by foot. It was a long hike at least in mind and the scenery were kinda cool at first but then it got boring real fast. The weather was also pretty bad which fuelled my negativity towards the hike even more. At the end the ruin was great. It is surrounded by beautiful coasts and colourful vegetation. I was on the fence about whether to stay in Corsica or go back to the main land since it was raining constantly everyday. I decided to leave because the weather forecast did not look good. Thank god I did because right after I left a storm hit the south of France which killed several people. Yikes! Avignon - France I paid a price dearly for sleeping on the floor of a ferry because on my way back I caught bedbugs from the carpet. I found hundreds of bites afterward and it was itchy as hell. It took me weeks to heal and I was traveling in paranoia from then. Not. Worth. It. After a painful night I decided to make use of my time in Avignon a bit more and went to LIsle-sur-la-Sorgue. The town is famous for its ancient watermills scattered around the city which were still functioning after all these years Except for the market it was kinda boring in LIsle-sur-la-Sorgue and so I hopped on the next bus to the Fontaine de Vaucluse and stay in nature for a little while before heading back. The next day I went to Arles a small town full of history and photogenic streets. This is my favourite town in Avignon. All the streets and ancient ruins including the colosseum made me feel like I was walking through history. The inside of the Church of St. Trophime in Arles. Im getting a bit of a Game of Throne vibe here for some reason. Isnt the street so beautiful? There were hundreds of these streets all of them colourful and unique in its own way. After a few days traveling around Avignon it was time to explore Avignon itself. Beautful door in Arles and a hole in a church in Avignon. Goodbye Avignon. Thank you for giving me so much to do while I healed my bedbug wounds. Bordeaux - France Bordeaux is one of the city in Europe I could see myself living in. I love a spacious city with a good mixed of history and architecture and this city has it all. I can never get enough of Place de la Bourse. The thin sheet of water mirror in front created a perfect symmetrical reflection of the building and you guys know how much I love symmetry. Mont Saint Michel - France I had to see Mont Saint Michel with my own eyes. Its one of those bucket list thing I must do. Although it would have looked better if I was there during the high tide but it was beautiful nonetheless. An fortified island like this could be a great base for when a zombie apocalypse happens. I call dibs. Paris - France Of course you can not go to France without going through Paris. I had my own agenda for Paris though which was to visit the locations used in one of my most favourite film of all time Before Sunset. This was an elevated park built on an abandoned railway track that stretched 5km across Paris And of course the Notre Dame cathedral. I did not bother going in though. I kinda like to appreciate things from a distance. I did not even go near the Eiffel tower because I know how touristy it is so I simply enjoyed it from the top of the Arc de Triomphe instead. I usually hate lining up to go see an attraction but I made an exception for this. Lined up for 2 hours to go into the catacomb a vast maze of skulls and bones buried beneath the city of light. I should have spend more time in Paris but my visa days are running out so I had to continue on to Germany. Stuttgart - Germany From Paris I took a bus to Stuttgart Germany and again stayed with my local friend Steffi. Through her I had the opportunity to live like a Stuttgarter socialized with her circle of friends and really got to enjoy Stuttgart like a local. I had a great time in Stuttgart. The most favorite thing for me was hanging out with Steffis friends and having a great time at the Containt event. Containt event Containt is a nonprofit project that breathes life into dead places with art music performance and festivals in a form of old freight containers timbers and tents. Munich - Germany Munich is where the Bavarian culture shines the most. From 1 litre beer stein to Weißwurst you get to be full AND drunk at the same time. On my last day in Munich I was able to convince my friend who was studying in the Munich university to take a break from her study and show me around. We got to try all sorts of weird ice creams from kebab to beer-flavoured. I love them all! We also went out of the city a bit and visited Nymphenburg Palace. I had experience many new things on this trip and one of them was here at the palace. It was the first time I asked a stranger to take a photo of me and they said no. Really! From my 2 years of traveling this was the first time a stranger said no to taking a photo for me. Erlangen - Germany After departing with my friend Julia in Lorrach I had the opportunity to visit her again this time in Erlangen where she is currently studying. It was a brief stop but it was nice to see a familiar face again. Cologne - Germany Noticed anything different here? Yes theres no bag because my bag was stolen at the Cologne train station! Worst of all my laptop passport and a hard drive with 2 years of photos and videos were also gone with the bag! Here is how it happened. I was waiting for my friend to come pick me up at the train station and when I was sitting down I forgot to wrap my daypack with me. As I was sitting someone came out of no where poked me and told me that I dropped a coin. They only needed 3 seconds of me turning my head to look at this guy and the bag was gone.. forever. Berlin - Germany I got over it in no time though and I bought a new bag the next day went to Berlin to get my temporary passport sorted and got a new laptop. It was an unnecessary inconvenience but nothing I couldnt handle. I also took the opportunity to slow down a bit and stayed in Berlin for a week. Luneburg - Germany I couldnt seem to catch a break. After Berlin I tried to go to Poland via bus but they rejected my temporary passport citing that there is no valid visa on my passport. Without know what to do I glance at a bus nearby and saw that it was leaving for Hamburg in 15 minutes. I said to myself Why the hell not? booked the ticket online got on that bus and off I went to Hamburg. Luckily I had a friend in Luneburg who was willing to host me. Leipzig - Germany With my temporary passport I only have 2 options. It was either stay in Germany until by visa days run out or go back to Thailand. I decided to stay and so after Hamburg my friend hooked me up with another couch in Leipzig and off I went. I really enjoyed Leipzig. Much less crowded than Hamburg or Berlin and it has a nice history to it. My favourite place in Leipzig was the first yeah try pronouncing that!. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations is a monument erected to commemorates Napoleons defeat at Leipzig. The monument had the raw ancient vibe to it. Its like Diablo meets Game of Thrones. Dresden I did not expect to visit Dresden when I first planned my Germany trip. Now Im glad my bag was stolen because I wouldnt have known how awesome Dresden if it werent for that thief. Dresden and its perfect blend between the alternative scene and all the classic architecture and art museums made this city one of the best in Germany. This was me standing in front of a master piece of painting the Fürstenzug. The next day me and Abi whom I met at the hostel took a train out into the wild and explored the Saxon-Switzerland National Park. Yes its one of the most amazing nature you could see in this part of Germany and no its NOT in Switzerland. We went and hiked around Bastei a beautiful rock formation that reminds me of Zhangjiajie in China. This is a must-see attraction and you should not miss it when you are in Dresden.

I would recommend you browse through Skyscanner or Momondo to find all the cheap flights from where you live to Georgia and compare them so that you can find the one best fit for your itinerary. From Tbilisi the cheapest option is to go by bus or marshrutka minivan. You have to take a bus to the Ortachala international autobus station. From here you can either buy a bus ticket to Yerevan which will cost you 15GEL and 12 hours or go with the marshrutka which will cost you 35 - 50GEL for a 5 - 6 hours drive. I went with the marshrutka as I prefer to settle into new cities before it gets dark so I can exchange money but a SIM card etc. I paid an overpriced fee of 50 GEL for the ride. How to Get Around Yerevan Transportation in Yerevan is very straight forward. In the city you can go with the Metro which will cost you only 100 AMD 20 cents USD for a single ride. If you want to go outside of Yerevan to say Khor Virap. You will have to get the local bus. There is no bus schedule you can obtain online so your best bet is to ask at the reception at your hostel. Hitchhiking is very common in Armenia. Heck even locals hitchhiked with us sometime. The locals are extremely friendly and even though most dont speak a word of English they will go out of their ways to help you. If you know a little bit of Russian you will be fine hitchhiking in Armenia. I do not though but I was with a group and there was a polish girl who speaks a bit of Russian and that helped us a lot in communicating where we want to go. Where to Stay in Yerevan The Theatre hostel is a small hostel with friendly staff and a pretty good location. It is only 20 minutes walk away from the city centre Republic Square. The air-conditioned dorm room is cheap given how comfortable the bed was. The staff were friendly and will go out of their ways to help you out. They treated me like friends which was awesome. A few things to note though the hostel itself is not spacious. There were barely rooms for my big backpack. Imagine a room with 8 people and 8 backpacks. Other than that it was a present stay. Daily Budget This place is very cheap compare to all the other countries and you can expect to pay around 20 - 30 USD per day per person and including accommodation and food. Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling which is leaning more toward the budget side of things. If you want to stick to this budget expect to sleep in dorms eat out only a few times and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation which often times involves walking. Travel Insurance If you are looking for a travel insurance to go along with your trip to Armenia I would recommend WorldNomads.com which is what I use to look for a travel insurance that fits my kind of adventure. They have a simple and flexible search system that allowed me to find the right insurance for the right amount of time at an affordable price in seconds. If you need a travel insurance give WorldNomads.com a try. Get a Quote from World Nomads Top 10 Things to Do in Yerevan 1. See the Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral This is the largest religious building in the South Caucasus along with the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Tbilisi. Its block-like architecture made it stood out from all the other cathedral in the region. Some people said it is ugly like my friend Anders but I like it. Its unique and kind of go well with all the other soviet-era buildings that scattered around Yerevan. If you are staying at the Theatre hostel the cathedral is only 2 minutes walk away. I went there early in the morning as I made my way to the Republic Square on foot. 2. Hang out at the Republic Square They dont call Yerevan the Pink city for nothing. As you stood at the center of the Republic Square you will notice that the majority of the buildings are made from volcanic bricks of varying shades of pink. I think the color reflects the fun and vibrant vibe of the city very well. This is where the cool kids hang out. Around the area there are several high-end restaurants shopping streets and hipster-worthy souvenior shops. When in doubt go to the Republic Square. 3. People Watching at the Republic Square at Night At night the Republic Square turned into a dancing musical fountain where locals come and enjoy the light and fountain shows for free. Watch the locals mingled while classical music played in the background and water shooting out in synchronization. 4. Immerse yourself at the Cascade The Cascade is a giant stairway showcasing different fountains and sculptures on each level. You need to see for yourself to know the true scale of the cascade. It is massive. With the Armenian architectural prowess you will never get bored hiking up the cascade. You will be surprised at the beauty of these micro parks you can find at every corner on the Cascade. At the top you will be able to get an unobstructed view of Yerevan and Mt Ararat. 5. Drop by at the Swarovski Cyrstal Palace The Swarovski Cyrstal Palace is at the top of the Cascade so you can drop by there after. The installation is quite photogenic. As you go in you will see multiple meshed bags filled with Swarovski crystals suspended from the ceiling 6. Admire the Matenadaran architecture This intimidating-looking soviet era structure is a repository of ancient manuscripts. Cut deep in the hillside behind and shielded by double steel blast doors this place is built to withstand a nuclear blast in order to preserve the ancient manuscripts. I personally did not go inside but if you are interested in the Armenian history than do check out the ancient manuscripts museum. 7. A little stop at the Karen Demirtchian Sport Complex If you are planning to go to the Genocide Museum you will have to walk pass through this somewhat-abandoned sport complex. Stare and wander at these soviet-era In Your Face kinda structure as you make your way to the Genocide Museum. As the saying goes theres beauty in decay. 8. Pay respect to the victim at the Genocide Memorial From the sport complex walk a little bit east and you will see a monument stood boldly up on a hill. Buy some flowers and pay respect to the victim of the Armenian Genocide by placing the flowers at the eternal flame at the center of the memorial. 9. Learn the history at the Armenian Genocide Museum Since I grew up in Bangkok we were not taught about the Armenian Genocide. It was both an eye-opener and a surprise as I walked through the museum and learned about the atrocities commited by the Ottoman Empire. The museum is very well laid-out with clear directions and information in English. Spend an hour or two there and you will understand the people more. Once you are done walking in the museum walk outside and enjoy the sunset over Mt Ararat from the balcony. 10. Climb down the pit in Khor Virap If you have a day to spare go to Khor Virap. It is a monastery located in the Ararat plain near the border with Turkey. The monastery has a significant historical value as the place where Gregory the Illuminator was initially imprisoned for 14 years. Gregory was the person who kickstarted the declaration of Armenia as a christian nation making it the first country in the world to do so. If you are not claustrophobic climb down the pit where Gregory was imprisoned. It was surprisingly spacious inside although I could not see myself staying alive here for long. The humidity will drive me crazy in no time. Dont forget to enjoy the view of the surrounding areas! Digital Nomad friendly cafe Caffè Vergnano located near the Republic Square is an awesome place to work from. It was so good I went there twice to get some work done when I was in Yerevan. The location is tugged away in a small street so the cafe is not too crowded. The coffee and sandwiches were awesome. The tables are plenty with a few plug outlets for you to charge your electronic. The wifi is lightning fast. It is faster than my internet in Bangkok!

Viva Safaris is a great tour operator which has been running its business since 1991. Out of all the safaris companies I have searched through Viva Safaris provides all that I needed they provide arranged transportation from JoBurg to Kruger National Park and back and the itinerary includes a bush walk and at the price I can handle others are way out of my budget and since I was traveling alone and the maximum people on the tour is 12 a few cool companions were a welcome change to my solo travels. Viva Safari Review Their services were top notch and I was quite happy with my decision in choosing Viva Safaris not to mention a lot of awesome friends I met because of the tour. If you are soloing and are looking for a budget tour to Kruger National Park without the hassle of driving there yourself they are for you. You can see their product listing here Viva Safaris Pricing Now that I have provided all the information for you lets laid back a bit and enjoy the photo essay of my 4 days in Kruger National Park with Viva Safaris. Kruger National Park Itinerary Day 1 Exploring Balule Private Game Reserve at Night The best part about traveling solo is meeting new awesome people while on the road and I did just that on our first stop half way from JoBurg to Kruger National Park. I met a very cool Australian group an amazing German couple and the wonderful ladies from Bern Switzerland. After a 5 hours drive we arrived at the Tremisana Lodge which is located inside the Balule private game reserve. In minutes after checked in we had to leave for a night game drive. Our first giraffe sighting right outside the lodge! Man I remember how ridiculously excited I was when I first saw it and how the feeling went away and replaced with boredom after like 5 sightings. I wanna see the leopard! My first safari drive ever! I cant remember a time I used my eyesight without starring at the screen all day as much as tracking down animals at night.  Our driver spotted a group of elephants out and about. We shut down the engine and watched them eat. This is how animals should be observed not behind a cage. Day 1 cont Dinner in the South African Bush After a few zebras and giraffes spotting the guide took us to a dinner in the bush they prepared. I was surprised by how neat the dinner was. Great food braai under moonlights right in the middle of the bush. No dinner can beat that! Our guide grilling our dinner. How do I know that we really were in the bush? This. We even have to be escorted if we wanna pee. How awesome is that!? Enjoying my first night in the bush before waking up super early in the morning 445 AM for a highly anticipated 3 hours morning bush walk Day 2 Morning Bush Walk in Balule Nature Reserve I was asked to wear a natural clothing which my bright blue fleece jacket was not qualified for so I ended up freezing my ass off while they drove through the chilling African wind. Ladies first? Haha. They both were quite adventurous so I let them lead. One thing for the ladies do tie your hair because your hair will get tangled by all sort of trees and bushes like what happened to my Swiss friends here. I had to help them untangled a couple of times. Dont expect a nice paved way for you to walk through. When they said a walk in the bush it really means we walk IN the bush. Sometimes even through them. My pant was a mess after the walk. We walked out into the open field heading to the riverbank hoping to see a few wild animals out for a drink. It was a beautiful morning as for every morning in Africa. Meet our Australian group Anthony his son and Leroy. They were hilarious the whole time! Great knowing all of you!  We found a lions track! Looks like it was here 2 hours earlier hunting for some food at dawn. As we walked along the river bank we heard a cracking sound from the bushes on our left. The guide thought it was an elephant so he went in and observed. Turns out it was this Hippo charging out of the bush right at us toward to river. The guides were panicking and asked us to stick together I didnt even have time to take a photo of when it was charging. Fortunately it continued down to the river without looking back. That was the first time I felt a rush of the African safari. The danger is very real. Day 2 cont An Afternoon Game Drive in Balule Nature Reserve After a 3 hours bush walk we went back to the lodge to wash up had lunch and headed out for an afternoon game drive with our guide Chris who looks somewhat like Orlando Bloom from the Pirates of the Caribbean. The Swiss girls didnt think so. D A giraffe greeted us with its long ass neck over all the trees that surrounded it. Zazu from Lion King! For the first time in my life I saw a living walking but old as hell wildebeest. The impala not knowing that we were observing from out jeep. As we drove by Sabrina from a German couple I met saw a lone water buffalo one of the big five. We tried out best to get closer to get a picture of this lone water buffalo but the engine sound scared it away. We thought all hope was lost until we accidentally stumbled upon a whole herd of buffalos nearby. That awesome feeling when you spent a whole day tracking down an animal and you found a whole herd of it was fascinating. After an awesome afternoon drive we grab our things from the Tremisana Lodge said goodbye to these monkeys and departed to our treehouse near the Kruger National Park entrance. Welcome to Marcs Treehouse Lodge the incredible way to sleep in the bush. As the sun set we gathered around an old school campfire enjoying our dinner exchanging stories of our lives back home. Nothing beats the good old storytelling around a campfire like this. Day 3 Tracking Down the Big 5 in Kruger National Park It was a great morning as always until problem struck. There were 2 german couples the one I befriended with Sabrina and Thomas was awesome but theres this other uptight couple who insisted that they sit together. Since I was the only one traveling alone on this tour I was asked to move to another truck. Of course I was pissed but at that time I didnt know that the German couple was the root cause so I complied as I didnt want to delay anymore of our time. As I walked pissed and all the Swiss ladies Katarina and Stephanie were also kicked out because even when my seat was available the German was unable to be seated together so the guide made a crappy decision to kick three of us to another car whereas forcing the German couple to move to the other car would have solved everything. We combined force and complained to the guide that they are the one that should move not us three. In the end the German couple realized we were complaining so they were forced to move instead. Thank god it didnt turn out in their favors. Right inside the gate we spotted our first rhino from across the river. This was the moment I wish I had that crazy zoom camera the one that looks like a canon. To celebrate our victory me and the swiss ladies exchanged a couple of shots with the elephants. Its good to have friends to help take photos of you when youve been traveling alone for so long. Like on big family. Either its their mother or father watching out for the children. Meet Stephanie and Katarina. One of my favorite people I met during the African trip. Our first stop after the fight with the bad german couple. They didnt look happy at all but I decided to just enjoy the place. After all it wasnt our false. Baobab or the Adansonia is the largest tree in Africa . Zebras in their habitat. A Kudu an antelope that can jump higher than the jeep or the fences the protects them from the road. One giant magnificent animal if you ask me. Bathing myself with African sun. Enjoying everything the bushes gotta offer. As its getting darker and darker and we only saw 3 out of the big five I thought all hope was lost until we spotted a whole herd of female lions sharpening their claws readying for a hunt at night. Mission accomplished! Seeing the lions. Thats all I came here for. We went back to the treehouse enjoying Castle beers around a camp fire while exchanging more stories. I can never get enough of this. Imagine instead of people going clubbing all the time they set up a campfire and enjoy each others companies.  Day 4 A Morning Bush Walk and Visiting Blyde River Canyon Our last day in the bush we began with a 1 hour morning bush walk around the lodge the lodge is inside a private reserve. The golden orb spiders that spread across this region. The sunlight and the spiders makes an awesome photo opportunities. After a morning bush walks we headed back to our rooms packed and departed for the Blyde River Canyon which we will continue in the next entry of our Solos Travelers Journal #8 so stay tuned for some doozy mind-blowingly living-on-the-edge kind of photos. Trust me the photo I took at the Blyde River Canyon will blow your mind. It is one of my best and I fear it might be the best for a long time to come. Stay tuned.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share In August 2015 I decided to leave a comfortable home in Bangkok and embarked on a 3 months journey to Europe camping and sleeping on peoples couches. Within this 3 months I have seen 4 countries hiked the Swiss and the French Alps slept on the floor of a ferry to Corsica celebrated my birthday with a German rap battle in Dresden went all hipster in Berlin got my bag stolen in Cologne watched a sunset on top of Sacromonte Spain and experienced one of the most dramatic time of my life. Following the success of my Follow me and Ill show you New Zealand post I have decided to continue this tradition and captured photos of my back throughout Europe. From Spain to Switzerland to France and ended in Germany.. Follow me and I’ll show you Europe Table of Contents Madrid - Spain Seville - Spain Granada - Spain Lugano - Switzerland Lucerne - Switzerland Bern - Switzerland Zurich - Switzerland St Gallen - Switzerland Appenzell - Switzerland Swiss National Park - Switzerland Matterhorn - Switzerland Lauterbrunnen - Switzerland Lorrach - Germany Lyon - France Chamonix - France Grenoble - France Corsica - France Avignon - France Bordeaux - France Mont Saint Michel - France Paris - France Stuttgart - Germany Munich - Germany Erlangen - Germany Cologne - Germany Berlin - Germany Luneburg - Germany Leipzig - Germany Dresden Videos Show More Madrid - Spain I landed in Madrid in the early morning and the first thing I did was to join a free walking tour and explored the city. Thank god I did that because I did not have a lot of time in Madrid and the walking tour showed me all the attractions in one go. I really hit the ground running when I arrived in Madrid. That same night after a 3 hours walking around the city in the heat of mid summer Spain I joined a pub crawl and went on a drinking spree. Needless to say I completely wasted the next day. Seville - Spain After Madrid I took a bus to Seville and explored the city by foot. I love European cities. Everything is in walking distance! This is possibly my favourite place in Seville the Plaza de Espana. The scale of the palace is just mindblowing. As I was walking around the palace it felt almost like I had the whole place to myself. I think due to its open-air corridors and vast space the place never felt crowded at anytime. Did you know that Star Wars was shot here? Me neither but dont get too excited though. It was used as one of the scene in the Attack of the Clones prequel not the new one. Granada - Spain Granada is my favourite city in Spain hands down. The laid-back culture the cheap tapas and the nature will make you want to stay here forever. As I had found out by experience the best way to see the city and meet new people in Spain is to join the free walking tour. We hiked up to the caves of Sacromonte and learned how the people living in the caves had come to be. After a few days exploring the city it was time to go out and explore the surrounding areas. Me and a couple of friends went out and hiked the waterfall trail in Monachil. We found a nice refreshing pool of water at the end to chill out and freshen up before making our way back. The trail is definitely not for people who have acrophobia. One of the person in our group backed out at the last minute because he did not feel comfortable walking along the side of a cliff. The trail itself was very easy but the terrain can get real rough sometimes. At one point we had to hang our bodies from the side of a cliff to continue on. Last day in Granada me and a couple of friends decided to grab a few beers and went up the Sacromonte again and watched the sunset. This is possibly the best place to experience sunset in all of Spain! Lugano - Switzerland From Spain I flew directly to Zurich to made it in time for my friends road trip. We took off to Lugano and stayed at my friends place which was 3 steps away from Lake Lugano. I had never associate Switzerland with hot climate but man was the sun burning furiously when I was there at the end of August. We could not go a day without swimming in the lake. A little morning stroll as we make our way across to Italy on foot. One of the benefit of having an open border between your neighbouring countries is that you can literally walk to another country. This was me walking from Switzerland to Italy. It only took us 15 minutes. Lucerne - Switzerland After 15 years I was finally back in Lucerne my childhood favourite city. For some reason I remember nothing about my childhood travel except Lucerne. I remembered this bridge vividly when I was here 15 years ago. I even remembered the stories told by our guide about the fire that were supposedly caused by a discarded cigarette. I even remembered where our tour bus parked 15 years ago! It was like a dejavu walking around Lucerne again. Check out the Church of St. Leodegars interior. Bern - Switzerland After spending half day in Lucerne we decided to spend another half in Bern. We made our way to see the Bern bear to realize that the bear had been moved to some other town. The weather wasnt so great but that never stop me from taking a photo of my back! . Zurich - Switzerland I couldnt resist passing these mountains without stopping and taking a photo of it. Switzerland really do take your breath away at every turn. Possibly one of the best lunch spot in Zurich. St Gallen - Switzerland Since we had a one day pass we decided to explore other cities a little bit. In the early morning we went to St Gallen. It was okay with a bunch of nice churches and streets but what we were looking for was some nature. Appenzell - Switzerland We sure found nature in Appenzell! Me and Hayden a friend I met during the road trip decided to find some hikes to do in the area. From Appenzell we took a train to Wasserauen and hiked to Seealpsee lake beautiful emerald lake located in the valleys in Appenzell. The hike was not hard per se but very steep. It took us around an hour to reach the lake. We were very impressed with the trail. We did not expect it to be so quiet and the nature to be so untouched because it was not far from the tourist attraction and the hike was only an hour but we sure got what we asked for. We found a little wooden church tugged away in the wild forest. A good hike is defined by the trail and the reward it gives at the end. A good trail always rewarded us with a jaw-dropping scenery at the end. Always. I can not but feel small and insignificant when standing face-to-face with mother nature. Even with half the valley covered in fog it was still beautiful. Can you imagine looking at this valley on a clear day? Swiss National Park - Switzerland After a week living cozily with my Swiss friend it was time to shake off that fondue weight and do some intense hiking. Me and Hayden bought a 4-day pass and roamed the land freely looking for an epic hike to do. We started off at the Swiss National Parkin Zernez. As soon as we arrived we setup our tent and summited Alp da Munt. It was a nice day and I did not want it to go to waste because from my experience hiking in New Zealand a good weather dont last. Im glad we did it because it was pouring cats and dogs the next day and we ended up exploring Zernez instead. The next mountain we tackled was the Munt la Schera. The day started out cold and wet but we decided to not waste another day hiding and powered through it. The trail took us real close to the border. We were only a few cows away from Italy. It took us 3 - 4 hours to reach the summit of Munt la Schera which stood at 2378m above sea level. As we approached the top we met this Swiss woman from Zurich who enthusiastically offered us chocolates and cheered us for reaching the summit together. Its this kind of genuine interaction that made me fall in love with hiking. It was so windy and cold we had to hide behind a rock as we ate our energy bars bit by bit like a Squirrel. This was me conquering the summit of Munt la Schera. We could not handle the cold any longer so we decided to hike down before another wave of clouds comes. From the summit onward the trail was simple and mostly exposed. I was so glad that it did not rain after that. If you like nature and want to avoid the crowd Swiss national park is another good option. Matterhorn - Switzerland After the Swiss National Park me and Hayden went to Zermatt to do some hiking around Matterhorn. We were bombarded with throngs and throngs of tourists. It was a shock coming from the Swiss National Park so we decided to get out of the city as fast as we could. We decided to combine multiple trails together and created a full day hike. We started off at 8 AM in Zermatt and hiked toward Furi. Me and Hayden were somehow split up. I was following someone who I thought was Hayden but when I realized it was not him it was too late. Thankfully we divided our food in half so we were able to continue our hike separately without having one starve to death. The first 3 hours I spent hiking from Zermatt to Schwarzsee Paradise. From Schwarzsee Paradise I continued up toward Matterhorn. I was on the fence about hiking to the Matterhorn base camp Hörnlihütte mountain hut at first since it would add another 3 hours to an already long hike 9 hours. In the end I said F*ck it. Im only here so often. How often do I get a chance to see Matterhorn up close? And off I went. In my mind I was planning to take a cable car back down after the hike and call it a day but that did not happen. As I was climbing I tried my best to keep my head down because I would have given up already if I saw how far the hut was. I eventually arrived at the base camp at 1 pm tired but still energetic enough to inspect the Matterhorn up close. The hut stood at 3260m above sea level and to think that I just climbed from Zermatt which was 1620m high in 5 hours was extraordinary. After half an hour at the hut I came down and instead of going back the same way I decided to tackle the Glacier trail which took me down to the glacier. It was a hell of a view from down here. After 3 hours walking along the Glacier trail I finally reached the stop that I was suppose to take the cable car down. Somehow the adventure found me again as I realized that the cable car was already close just 10 minutes before I arrived. The situation did not look any better as the sun started to set. I quickly scanned the area and found a trail that goes directly to Zermatt BUT it would take another 3 hours! I was running out of food and water and I was losing daylight every minute and so I decided to bite the bullet and ran down as fast as I could. After a 9 hours hike running is usually not what I would do but I had no choice. I arrived back in Zermatt at 8PM and found Hayden waiting for me. I was gone for so long he almost reported me missing to the police. Lauterbrunnen - Switzerland After a crazy day in Zermatt we decided to take it slow this time and went on a little stroll in Lauterbrunnen. The valleys in Lauterbrunen are perfect for base jumping and as we made our way to the Staubbach Falls we saw a couple of base jumpers free falling from the cliff. One of them I couldnt for the life of me find where he/she went! Another day another hike. This time we went with a 2 hours hike to the small uphill town Wegnen. After about an hour it rained on us hard and we had to abort the hiking mission and go back to the hostel. The next day we bid farewell as I have to meet my friends in Basel and so we went separate ways. Lorrach - Germany After Lauterbrunen I decided to make my way toward France and in between that I stopped at Basel and crossed the border to Lorrach in Germany to meet my friends Julia and Jannis. We all met in Vietnam on a train to Ninh Binh and now we met again in Germany. Oh the randomness of traveling! Lyon - France After 2 weeks in Switzerland I decided that it was time to move on to my next country France. I took a train from Basel to Lyon and couch-surfed at my good friend house Aurelie whom I met in Australia 2 years ago. This was her showing my around the Ancient Roman Theatre near the hilltop Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière. Theres nothing like having a local to show you around. You got to see how they live and all the hidden gems only the city dwellers know. There are hundreds of hidden passages weave through the old quarter of Lyon. These were a few of them. I spent almost a week living like a local in Lyon before heading to my next destination Chamonix. Chamonix - France I was finally back in the mountain exactly where I belonged. After a week in a city it was great to be back in nature again. The weather was clear so I decided to make use of that day to the max and combined 2 trails to create a one full day hike. I combined the Grand Balcon trail and the Lac Brac trail together creating an 8 hours hike in total. The problem was I was there at the beginning of the low season and so all the cable cars were closed and I had to walk the entire length of the cable car which added 3 - 4 hours to the hike. Since I was there at the beginning of Autumn the colors were extra vivid in the mountains. I have never hike during Autumn before so this was a nice surprise. I kinda like the French Alps more. The mountains here are more epic for some reason. But Mont Blanc is not as iconic as Matterhorn. Mont Blanc looks like a little blob being carried by other mountains whereas Matterhorn is its own beast. The Grand Balcon is definitely one of the trail I recommend you to do if you are short on time. It will give you an unmatched view of the whole mountain range as you see in the photos. Its not all roses and sunshine though especially when hiking with me. This was the moment I stepped on an massive ant nest! Hundreds of ants were crawling on my right foot at the moment the photo was taken. From the end of the Grand Balcon trail comes the Lac Branc or White Lake in English. This is one of the most photogenic location around this area. The lake when theres no wind creates the perfect reflection of the mountain range. It was so calm and peaceful I could stay there for days. In fact I stayed there for hours which costed me greatly as you will learn about it in the next photo. It was 5pm when I started to make my way down from Lac Branc. I thought I would be back in Argentiere in time to catch the last train back to Chamonix. Dont get me wrong I was at the train station right on time. I waited and the train never came. As it turned out only the bus runs that day for some reasons and I ended up missing the bus because I was waiting at the train station! In the end I had to walk 2 hours back in the dark on the side of the mountainous road. It was so dangerous Im glad I survived to tell about it. I almost collapse when I arrived in Chamonix. It was 10pm and I found the nearest bar ordered a steak and devoured the hell out of it while watching the Rugby World Cup. It was a great day! I decided to extend my stay in Chamonix to rest and to get on to a cable car to the top of Aiguille du midi and see the Mont Blanc up close. It was magnificent! Grenoble - France With great friends come great opportunities. I surfed another couch in Grenoble this time with my friend Delphine who works as a guide in Grotte de Choranche one of the most unique cave in France displaying one of the thinnest stalactites I have ever seen! So delicate.. so fragile. I took this opportunity to tagged along with her to work as she personally showed me around the cave. What an awesome job she has! After the personal tour I went on my own and hike the canyons to Pont en Royans another small town with buildings hanging out off a cliff. Corsica - France I took a ferry from Toulon to Ajaccio Corsica after Grenoble. It was an overnight ferry and the cabin would cost me 90 Euros extra. I did not want to spend that much money for a night in the ferry so I decided to rough it and slept on the floor. I had a great night sleep! I had heard about this ruin in the west coast of Corsica called Tour de la Parata and so the next day I decided to go to the ruin.. by foot. It was a long hike at least in mind and the scenery were kinda cool at first but then it got boring real fast. The weather was also pretty bad which fuelled my negativity towards the hike even more. At the end the ruin was great. It is surrounded by beautiful coasts and colourful vegetation. I was on the fence about whether to stay in Corsica or go back to the main land since it was raining constantly everyday. I decided to leave because the weather forecast did not look good. Thank god I did because right after I left a storm hit the south of France which killed several people. Yikes! Avignon - France I paid a price dearly for sleeping on the floor of a ferry because on my way back I caught bedbugs from the carpet. I found hundreds of bites afterward and it was itchy as hell. It took me weeks to heal and I was traveling in paranoia from then. Not. Worth. It. After a painful night I decided to make use of my time in Avignon a bit more and went to LIsle-sur-la-Sorgue. The town is famous for its ancient watermills scattered around the city which were still functioning after all these years Except for the market it was kinda boring in LIsle-sur-la-Sorgue and so I hopped on the next bus to the Fontaine de Vaucluse and stay in nature for a little while before heading back. The next day I went to Arles a small town full of history and photogenic streets. This is my favourite town in Avignon. All the streets and ancient ruins including the colosseum made me feel like I was walking through history. The inside of the Church of St. Trophime in Arles. Im getting a bit of a Game of Throne vibe here for some reason. Isnt the street so beautiful? There were hundreds of these streets all of them colourful and unique in its own way. After a few days traveling around Avignon it was time to explore Avignon itself. Beautful door in Arles and a hole in a church in Avignon. Goodbye Avignon. Thank you for giving me so much to do while I healed my bedbug wounds. Bordeaux - France Bordeaux is one of the city in Europe I could see myself living in. I love a spacious city with a good mixed of history and architecture and this city has it all. I can never get enough of Place de la Bourse. The thin sheet of water mirror in front created a perfect symmetrical reflection of the building and you guys know how much I love symmetry. Mont Saint Michel - France I had to see Mont Saint Michel with my own eyes. Its one of those bucket list thing I must do. Although it would have looked better if I was there during the high tide but it was beautiful nonetheless. An fortified island like this could be a great base for when a zombie apocalypse happens. I call dibs. Paris - France Of course you can not go to France without going through Paris. I had my own agenda for Paris though which was to visit the locations used in one of my most favourite film of all time Before Sunset. This was an elevated park built on an abandoned railway track that stretched 5km across Paris And of course the Notre Dame cathedral. I did not bother going in though. I kinda like to appreciate things from a distance. I did not even go near the Eiffel tower because I know how touristy it is so I simply enjoyed it from the top of the Arc de Triomphe instead. I usually hate lining up to go see an attraction but I made an exception for this. Lined up for 2 hours to go into the catacomb a vast maze of skulls and bones buried beneath the city of light. I should have spend more time in Paris but my visa days are running out so I had to continue on to Germany. Stuttgart - Germany From Paris I took a bus to Stuttgart Germany and again stayed with my local friend Steffi. Through her I had the opportunity to live like a Stuttgarter socialized with her circle of friends and really got to enjoy Stuttgart like a local. I had a great time in Stuttgart. The most favorite thing for me was hanging out with Steffis friends and having a great time at the Containt event. Containt event Containt is a nonprofit project that breathes life into dead places with art music performance and festivals in a form of old freight containers timbers and tents. Munich - Germany Munich is where the Bavarian culture shines the most. From 1 litre beer stein to Weißwurst you get to be full AND drunk at the same time. On my last day in Munich I was able to convince my friend who was studying in the Munich university to take a break from her study and show me around. We got to try all sorts of weird ice creams from kebab to beer-flavoured. I love them all! We also went out of the city a bit and visited Nymphenburg Palace. I had experience many new things on this trip and one of them was here at the palace. It was the first time I asked a stranger to take a photo of me and they said no. Really! From my 2 years of traveling this was the first time a stranger said no to taking a photo for me. Erlangen - Germany After departing with my friend Julia in Lorrach I had the opportunity to visit her again this time in Erlangen where she is currently studying. It was a brief stop but it was nice to see a familiar face again. Cologne - Germany Noticed anything different here? Yes theres no bag because my bag was stolen at the Cologne train station! Worst of all my laptop passport and a hard drive with 2 years of photos and videos were also gone with the bag! Here is how it happened. I was waiting for my friend to come pick me up at the train station and when I was sitting down I forgot to wrap my daypack with me. As I was sitting someone came out of no where poked me and told me that I dropped a coin. They only needed 3 seconds of me turning my head to look at this guy and the bag was gone.. forever. Berlin - Germany I got over it in no time though and I bought a new bag the next day went to Berlin to get my temporary passport sorted and got a new laptop. It was an unnecessary inconvenience but nothing I couldnt handle. I also took the opportunity to slow down a bit and stayed in Berlin for a week. Luneburg - Germany I couldnt seem to catch a break. After Berlin I tried to go to Poland via bus but they rejected my temporary passport citing that there is no valid visa on my passport. Without know what to do I glance at a bus nearby and saw that it was leaving for Hamburg in 15 minutes. I said to myself Why the hell not? booked the ticket online got on that bus and off I went to Hamburg. Luckily I had a friend in Luneburg who was willing to host me. Leipzig - Germany With my temporary passport I only have 2 options. It was either stay in Germany until by visa days run out or go back to Thailand. I decided to stay and so after Hamburg my friend hooked me up with another couch in Leipzig and off I went. I really enjoyed Leipzig. Much less crowded than Hamburg or Berlin and it has a nice history to it. My favourite place in Leipzig was the first yeah try pronouncing that!. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations is a monument erected to commemorates Napoleons defeat at Leipzig. The monument had the raw ancient vibe to it. Its like Diablo meets Game of Thrones. Dresden I did not expect to visit Dresden when I first planned my Germany trip. Now Im glad my bag was stolen because I wouldnt have known how awesome Dresden if it werent for that thief. Dresden and its perfect blend between the alternative scene and all the classic architecture and art museums made this city one of the best in Germany. This was me standing in front of a master piece of painting the Fürstenzug. The next day me and Abi whom I met at the hostel took a train out into the wild and explored the Saxon-Switzerland National Park. Yes its one of the most amazing nature you could see in this part of Germany and no its NOT in Switzerland. We went and hiked around Bastei a beautiful rock formation that reminds me of Zhangjiajie in China. This is a must-see attraction and you should not miss it when you are in Dresden.

The list goes on. There are so many amazing sites here that you could spend days heck even weeks just seeing the main most well-known ones. But there’s more to Paris than the sites that attract thousands upon thousands of visitors each day. While I was living Paris the past few months I made it my mission to see some of the more unusual lesser-known but equally awesome attractions that didn’t come with the aggravating crowds that make so many of Paris’ attractions unbearable. And while some of the things on the list below might not be super secret” attractions or activities they do fall into the category of overlooked attractions” so I included them. Here are some of the best off-the-beaten-path things to see and do in Paris 1. Le Manoir de Paris This is where macabre museum meets haunted house. Numerous rooms highlight some of the more unsettling aspects of Paris’s long and often dark past such as the Phantom of the Opera vampires or the crocodiles in the sewers. Using real actors as well as animatronics the city’s gruesome and unsettling history is brought to life in an interesting way. In addition to their museum they also have escape rooms as well as different levels of intensity depending on how scared you get! 18 Rue de Paradis +33 6 70 89 35 87 lemanoirdeparis.com. Open Fridays 6pm-930pm and weekends 3pm-630pm. Admission is 29 EUR for adults and 20 EUR for children 10-15. 2. Musée Édith Piaf Édith Piaf is perhaps the most famous French singer from the 1930s to the 1960s and know around the world for her songs La vie en rose and Non je ne regrette rien which appeared in the movie Inception. She lived in a little apartment in the Ménilmontant district at the start of her career which has been turned into a tiny museum dedicated to her. You get a glimpse at her life through her gold and platinum records photographs clothing letters from fans posters recordings and sheet music. 5 Rue Crespin du Gast +33 1 43 55 52 72. Open Monday-Wednesday 1pm-6pm and Thursdays 10am-12pm. Admission is free but you’ll need to make an appointment. You’ll also want to either speak decent French or go with someone who does. 3. Musée Curie Marie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the only woman to win it twice for her research into radioactivity a word that she invented. She was the first female professor at the University of Paris as well as the first woman to be entombed in the Panthéon on her own merits. Located in the 5th arrondissement this museum in her old laboratory highlights her radiological research. It’s insightful and eye-opening for anyone unfamiliar with her historic discoveries. 1 Rue Pierre et Marie Curie +33 1 56 24 55 33 musee.curie.fr. Open Wednesday-Saturday 1pm-5pm. Admission is free. 4. Archives Nationales Opened in 1867 the National Archives houses thousands of historical documents dating back to 625 CE. One of six national archives in the country the museum sheds light on France’s turbulent past providing nuanced historical details and context through permanent and temporary exhibitions. Built by the order of Napoleon I the building itself known as the Hôtel de Soubise is absolutely stunning. It is in the late Baroque style embracing long columns and lots of statues and sculptures. It features immaculate grounds and gardens as well. They always hold a lot of good exhibitions too. 59 Rue Guynemer +33 1 75 47 20 02 archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/en. Open Monday-Saturday 9am-5pm. Admission is 8 EUR per person. 5. The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy Opened in 1898 this museum is home to over 1000 animal skeletons from around the world including complete skeletons of elephants large cats and even dinosaurs. It’s as interesting as it is unsettling all the animals are facing the same way making it look like you’re in the midst of some undead stampede! 2 Rue Buffon +33 1 40 79 56 01 www.mnhn.fr/en/visit/lieux/galerie-paleontologie-anatomie-comparee-paleontology-and-comparative-anatomy-gallery. Open daily 10am-6pm closed Tuesdays. Admission is free. 6. The Vampire Museum Paris has a long history with the esoteric one that is brought to life in this fascinating if not macabre museum founded by an eccentric scholar to showcase his knowledge of the undead and esoteric. Here you’ll find vampire-killing kits rare texts on demonology and mysterious ancient relics. It’s a busy eclectic creepy museum that’s a feast for the eyes and one worthy of a visit if you’re at all interested in more obscure and fanciful tales. It’s a fun kitschy museum. 14 Rue Jules David +33 1 43 62 80 76 artclips.free.fr/musee_des_vampires/MuseeVampires1.html. You’ll need to make an appointment in advance by phone. Don’t worry if the voicemail greeting is in French — the curator speakers perfect English. 7. Petite Ceinture In use from 1862 through 1964 the railway circling Paris was abandoned when the city expanded beyond its limits. It’s mostly hidden behind buildings and covered in wild plants and grass now though some sections are now officially open to the public. You’ll find all sorts of flowers and street art along the tracks. While some sections are illegal to visit near Parc Georges Brassens you’ll find a section of the tracks known as the ‘Passage de la Petite Ceinture’ that is both free and legal to visit. It’s located in the 15e arrondissement. 8. The Salvador Dalí Sundial This surrealist sundial was created by world-renowned artist Salvador Dalí. Located on Rue Saint-Jacques it’s is a mix of a human face and a scallop shell the symbol of the Camino to Santiago since the street is named after the saint. While the sundial doesn’t actually work it’s nevertheless an easy way to see a piece of artwork by one of the most famous artists in the world. 27 Rue Saint-Jacques. Open 24/7 with no admission. 9. Montmartre Cemetery While the Père Lachaise Cemetery is the largest and most popular in Paris for a more secluded stroll check out the Montmartre Cemetery. Plenty of people visit the top of Montmartre for Sacré-Coeur and the view but few take the time to wander this cemetery sitting at the foot of the district. It opened in 1825 and is home to many cobwebbed mausoleums as well as a handful of stray cats. You won’t see many people here so you can explore in peace. 20 Avenue Rachel +33 1 53 42 36 30 paris.fr/equipements/cimetiere-de-montmartre-5061. Open Monday-Friday 8am-6pm Saturdays 830am-6pm and Sundays 9am-6pm. 10. The Museum of Counterfeiting Opened in 1972 this museum is home to counterfeit items that have been collected by France’s customs agents and police as well as donated items from brands and consumers alike. There are over 500 items in the museum ranging from counterfeit art and luxury goods to more mundane items like cleaning supplies. While some knockoffs are impressive in their duplicity it’s also funny to see just how bad some counterfeiters were! 16 Rue de la Faisanderie +33 1 56 26 14 03 musee-contrefacon.com. Open Monday-Saturday 2pm-530pm. Admission is 6 EUR per person for adults and 5 EUR for students and seniors. 11. Promenade Planteé Coulée verte René-Dumont This tree-lined walkway is a greenbelt that extends almost 5km along the old Vincennes railway line. The railway line ceased functioning in 1969 with the park being inaugurated a few decades afterward. Until New York built their High Line it was the only elevated park in the entire world. And honestly this is way nicer then the NYC High Line. You’ll find lots of trees flowers ponds and places to sit along this long path that stretches from Bastille to the edge of Paris. It’s a long easy and beautiful walk. You won’t find many people here. Even on a nice day it’s rather empty. It quickly became one of my favorite things to do in Paris and I can’t recommend coming here enough! 1 Coulée verte René-Dumont 12th arrondissement. Open daily from 8am-930pm. Admission is free. 12. Canal Saint-Martin Stretching 4.5km the Canal Saint-Martin is a man-made waterway commissioned by Napoleon. Construction finished in 1825 connecting the Canal de l’Ourcq to the Seine via both above ground locks and underground tunnels. While not any secret spot on a nice day you’ll find the canal lined with people it’s mostly a spot for locals who want to have a picnic and relax. So say no to the Seine and come have your outdoor picnic along the canal. It’s more relaxing and there will be fewer people! The canal starts at Place de Stalingrad and ends at Quai de la Râpée. Canal cruises last 2.5 hours and cost around 16 EUR per person. 13. Museé de Montmartre Founded in 1960 this museum is located throughout two building that dates back to the 17th century. Over the years the buildings were home to many famous writers and painters. The gardens of the museum were actually renovated to look more like the gardens in Renoir’s paintings there is also a vineyard nearby that dates back to the Middle Ages but it makes horrible wine. The museum’s permanent collection includes a wide variety of paintings posters and drawings. 12 Rue Cortot +33 1 49 25 89 39 museedemontmartre.fr/en/le-musee. Open daily from 10am-6pm 7pm in the summer. Admission is 12 EUR for adults which includes an audio guide. Discounts are available for students children and persons with disabilities. *** While the main sights in Paris are always worth checking out if you want to be more than a tourist and develop a greater appreciation for the City of Light’s unique and complex history visit these unconventional and unusual attractions in Paris.

Of course if you plan on spending some time in Napa Valley and nearby Sonoma you’ll most likely want to explore some of the 600 wineries in the area. A great way to do this — both to get some local insider knowledge and so that there’s no need to drink and drive — is to take a Napa wine tour. There are nearly as many wine tour options as there are vineyards. I’ve listed some of my favorites here and you can decide which fits your style and more importantly your budget. Just remember that you’ll usually also have to pay tasting fees on top of the tour costs — these vary between $20 and $40 — though many will waive that fee if you buy some wine. Also don’t forget especially if you’re coming from outside the United States that you’ll need to be 21 or over to join these tours though some allow children to tag along. 1. Napa Valley Wine Trolley If you’re after something a bit different then the Napa Valley Wine Trolley is a good way to go. Instead of a regular tour bus you’ll ride on a replica of a cable car. It’s an open-air car of course so make sure you pick the right weather to try this. Tours leave from the Oxbow Market in Napa a $99 tour includes four wineries and a casual picnic-style lunch plus unlimited bottled water and soft drinks between tastings. You can upgrade to the full-day Castle tour $139 which includes a two-hour stop and tasting at Castello di Amorosa. 2. Napa Valley Bike Tours Of course being a valley full of vineyards Napa is a really scenic place so exploring it by bicycle is a great option. Napa Valley Bike Tours offers either guided or self-guided rides leaving from their store in Yountville. The popular half-day guided tour is $124 per person with two winery visits and a great guide who’ll give you the full story of the area. The handy part about the self-guided tours is that besides being able to visit the wineries you choose at your own pace you still get a box lunch and any wine you buy will be picked up for you riding with wine in your backpack gets old really fast. Self-guided tours cost $114 per person and also include comfy bikes helmets and all the planning info you need. 3. Calistoga Bikeshop Another bicycle option is Calistoga Bikeshop a popular rental shop that also runs guided day tours for $150 including a hybrid bike a picnic lunch and pick-up for any wine you buy. The guides plan a unique route depending on what the group members want starting from their shop in Calistoga. If you have an extra day in the area and don’t need more wine Calistoga also offers great mountain biking trips to the Palisades or along the Oat Hill Mine Trail. 4. Platypus Wine Tours Platypus brands itself as the anti-wine-snob wine tour” so if you want to have a fun day learning more about wine then this is a good choice. The name is memorable but you won’t actually see a platypus anywhere in Napa Valley in case you’re wondering. Platypus runs small-group trips taking in four wineries for $110 including a picnic lunch focusing on small and medium-sized usually family-owned wineries. You can choose from tours centered on Sonoma Valley Napa Valley or North Sonoma. 5. Active Wine Adventures As the name suggests Active Wine Adventures offers tours that include more than just wine tasting so it’s a great way to explore Napa Valley. For example the Hike & Wine tours start with a two-hour hike in some of valley’s beautiful landscapes and move on to a lunch and winery tasting experience. These cost $139 plus lunch because you can choose from a high-end restaurant lunch or a vineyard picnic. They offer similar tours in the Sonoma area too. 6. Green Dream Tours Try some wine and help the world. Green Dream has a focus on sustainability besides using green business practices it also buys carbon offsets to balance its use of fuel. Their Napa Valley tours $144 $154 on weekends are among the few where the tasting fees at three boutique wineries are included. Green Dream also offers a combo tour taking in three wineries across Sonoma and Napa Valley with lunch at the Oxbow Public Market $139 weekdays $149 weekends. For visitors to San Francisco there’s a combo with a tour of Alcatraz plus two Sonoma boutique wineries for $179. 7. Small Lot Wine Tours If you’re coming by car to the Napa Valley region then Small Lot can be a really budget-friendly way to enjoy a wine tour. They provide a tour guide who’ll drive your car for you for the day and design a tour route just right for you depending on the kind of wine you want to taste what you want to do for lunch and whether you’re planning on buying wine. At $50 per hour with a four-hour minimum if you’ve got a car full of friends this can work out to be one of the cheapest ways to explore Napa but still have local expert advice. 8. Napa Valley Wine Country Tours Napa Valley Wine Country Tours offer full-day trips from San Francisco including a Golden Gate Bridge photo opportunity to four wineries in the Napa and Sonoma regions. Tours include a picnic lunch and are usually $119 per person sometimes there are $99 specials on the website. For something a bit different they also run wine tours around the Napa Valley in an open-top convertible limousine including a castle visit for $150. *** There are so many options for touring the Napa Valley and experiencing all the wine culture the area has to offer depending on your tastes and preferences. These suggestions should ensure that you have a great day out exploring one of the world’s most famous wine regions. Book Your Trip to Napa Valley Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo. They are my two favorite search engines because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share Dresden was the place I celebrated my 27th birthday where I began my day with a hike in the Saxony Switzerland region and ended my night with a German rap battle. Needless to say it was one of the best birthday I had all because of Dresden and its awesome culture. Dresden is where history and modernity meet. It was pretty much destroyed after World War 2 which allows the city Baroque beauty to be diffused with modern artistry when it was rebuilt. Because of this you will find that Dresden is one of the most unique city in Germany offering everything from the majestic treasures of architecture to stunning nature in Saxony Switzerland all without the crazy amount of tourists like in Berlin or Munich.

It is located at the center of the artistic zone of Dresden Neustadt with a wide selection of bars for you to enjoy the nightlife. The hostel has a social atmosphere to it with a cozy common area and a balcony with bean bags for your privacy. They also have one of the most friendly staff that will organize weekly activities for people to connect. My trip couldnt have been this fun if it wasnt the people I met here and the information provided by the staff. I wouldnt have known about the free jazz concert or the German rap battle night if it wasnt for them! Mid-Range - LaLeLu Hostel Dresden - 48 USD / Night Double Room How to Get to Dresden Germany The best way to get here is to fly into one of Germanys hub cities like Frankfurt or Berlin and take a bus from there. I would recommend you browse through Skyscanner or Momondo to find all the cheap flights from where you live to Germany and compare them so that you can find the one best fit for your itinerary. If you are taking a train operated by Deutsche Bahn DB or a bus FlixBus make sure you get off at the right station. Dresden is served by 2 big train stations the Dresden Neustadt which is nearer to our hostel and the main railway station the Dresden Hauptbahnhof. I took a FlixBus from Leipzig to Dresden for 7 Euros. Originally I booked the bus ticket to Dresden Hauptbahnhof not the Neustadt station but luckily the Neustadt train station was one of the stops before the Hauptbahnhof so I was able to hop off at the right place before the bus continued. Note Both the bus and the train drop people off at the either Dresden Neustadt or at the Dresden Hauptbahnhof. How to Get Around Dresden Germany Inside the city you can take a tram or walk. Most of the attractions in Dresden are located in the old town which is only 15 minutes walk away from the hostel. If you planned to do the Bastei hike which you should you must take a train from the Neustadt station heading toward the direction of Schöna or Bad Schandau to the Kurort Lathen station and simply follow the direction across the river and you should arrive at the start of the hike. Daily Budget Traveling here on average will cost you more than traveling in most countries out there. You can expect to spend around 45 - 65 USD per day per person with food accommodation and transportation. Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling which is leaning more toward the budget side of things. If you want to stick to this budget expect to sleep in dorms eat out only a few times and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation which often times involves walking. Travel Insurance If you are looking for travel insurance to go along with your trip to Germany I would recommend WorldNomads.com which is what I use to look for a travel insurance that fits my kind of adventure. They have a simple and flexible search system that allowed me to find the right insurance for the right amount of time at an affordable price in seconds. If you need travel insurance give WorldNomads.com a try. Get a Quote from World Nomads One Day Itinerary Top 10 Things to Do in Dresden Germany 1. Visit and Hike to Bastei Bridge Half Day The Bastei bridge and the stunning nature around Saxony Switzerland Dont be fooled by the name it is still in Germany made it all worthwhile to visit East Germany. The landscape in Saxony Switzerland doesnt even feel like Germany to me it reminds me more of the spires I saw in Zhangjiajie National Park in China. This is not much of a hike in my opinion it was more like a nature walk. The walk took us around an hour to complete but we took our time and spent almost 3 hours walking around. There were many lookout points worth seeing near Bastei bridge. The one along the side of a cliff will give you a view of the peaceful town of Kurort Rathen. Further along the trail you will be able to grasp the beauty of the landscape of the Saxony Switzerland from another lookout point and at the end you will be able to walk across the Bastei bridge itself. To get to Bastei Bridge from Dresden you will have to take a train heading toward the direction of Schöna or Bad Schandau to the Kurort Lathen station from the Dresden Neustadt station. Once you arrive go into the town and cross the river with a ferry. From there you should be able to follow the direction to the start of the hike. 2. Visit Dresdens Historical Old Town Dresdens old town is surrounded by amazing Baroque architecture. Right at the gate you will find the Georgenbau a renaissance-style gate/palace that was built in the 1500s. On the right side of the gate is the most important church in the city Dresden Cathedral. Katholische Hofkirche is the landmark of Dresden and the first structure you will see when you enter the Old Town area. Its a beautiful old Roman Catholic Cathedral that was renovated after it was destroyed during WW2. Not too far from Katholische Hofkirche you will find Semperoper Dresden or Dresden Opera House another unique building with beautiful and intricate detail design on its facade. If your trip is aligned with a show in the Opera House take the opportunity to go and see an even more beautiful interior. Zwinger is a Baroque-style palace with gardens art exhibitions and more for you to walk around and learn a bit more about the historical importance of the city. If you want to feel like a noble walking around beautiful gardens surrounded by porcelain objects and scientific instruments Zwinger is a place you shouldnt miss. 3. Marvel at the Size and Scale of Fürstenzug Mural Right around the corner from the fate is the Fürstenzug. It is a massive mural of procession of the rulers of Saxony which was originally painted between 1871 and 1876. The superb attention to detail on the mural was quite a sight to behold. 4. Check Out Dresden Frauenkirche Church Church of Our Lady Dresden Frauenkirche church is a famous landmark of Dresden. It is a Lutheran church that gives a great example of Protestant sacred architecture featuring one of the largest domes in Europe. The church is located at the center of the Neumarkt square where you will be surrounded by other impressive Baroque architecture. Take a walk around the church and appreciate the fact that you are standing in the square that was completed destroyed during the World War 2. 5. Walk Along the Brühls Terrace Nicknamed The Balcony of Europe The Balcony of Europe or the Brühls Terrace is a terrace that stretches high above the shore of the river Elbe. On one side you will be able to appreciate the beautiful architectural wonders of the buildings in the Old town whereas on the other you can enjoy your coffee along the river Elbe while watching locals doing the same. 6. Check out the Old Masters Picture Gallery Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister Since it was raining the first day I arrived I decided to make that day a museum day and checked out the Old Masters Picture Gallery. The museum includes around 750 paintings during the 15th - 18th centuries from German French and Spanish painters. You can really see how realism art the making of art that resemble life developed right before your eyes. I was able to spot a few famous paintings as well such as the Tower of Babel and being able to read the history of it was interesting. 8. Go to a Free Concert in Dresden This is by far one of my favorite things to do in Dresden to check out what is happening at Scheune On every Monday Jazzfanatics organize a free Jazz concert that you can attend at Kulturzentrum Scheune. On my first day arriving in Dresden I attended one of their concerts and I instantly fall in love with Dresden then. You can also find many other kinds of events happening every week both on weekdays and weekends some free some cost 5 EUR for entrance or more. If you are in Dresden for a few days be sure to check Scheune out and see what events they have to offer. 8. Enjoy Dresdens Crazy Nightlife Berlin may be the most popular nightlife destination in Germany but if you are looking for a place that is less crowded and yet offer the same fun vibe at a cheaper price Dresden is a place you will never forget. I was day on my birthday so I had a chance to explore the nightlife there quite a bit with a group of people I met at my hostel. If you are looking for a night out with your friends to drink some beers chill out and talk to each other while playing Pool Hebedas Bar is one of oldest pub in the area and they have a nice atmospheric interior. They also serve nice beers at a very affordable price. If you are looking for a place to go pre-party this is it. If you are looking for a place to dance your night away check out Mondfisch Kneipe & Bar or Madness Bar & Pub. Both of these places have events and live concerts happen quite often and it often gets crowded late in the night. If you are looking for a fun night out be sure to check out these places. 9. Have a Cup of Coffee at The Cafe Oswaldz Cafe Oswaldz is a cozy little cafe that serves great range of coffees including Flat White and a delicious selection of bakeries. It has that Parisian cafe vibe to it AKA a perfect balance of a moderate background noise of people chattering and the smell of hand-brewed coffee. Unfortunately the free wifi may or may not work depending on the number of people in the cafe. Although once you are able to connect the internet flies. There are also power outlets for you to top up your laptops juice. Definitely the best place to get a good cup of coffee while getting some work done hands down. 10. Explore the Hidden Passageways of Dresden Dresden has many secrets and hidden gems and some of them are hidden right under our noses and only those who dare to explore will find them. Among the hidden gems in these alley way is Kunsthofpassage Dresden a run-down backyard renovated into an art center with 5 really cool art installation the Courtyard of Element the Courtyard of Light the Courtyard of Metamorphosis the Courtyard of Animals and the Courtyard of Mythical Garden. Photos by Fred Romero. One of my favorite courtyards is the Courtyard of Element where music is created through water running down through an intricate design of water pipe on a beautiful turquoise building. Something you dont see every day. If you are in Dresden be sure to walk around these hidden passageways and explore all the beautiful architecture and modern art installation the city has to offer.

Heck I love it so much that I’m currently living here! This city has it all – and it would take a lifetime to really see. Even after a decade of visiting and months living here I’m still finding new things to see and do! And while the city itself has a million and one sights to visit there are also some fantastic day trips from Paris that can help you escape the city – and see what else this incredible country has to offer. From historic vineyards to medieval castles to cheesy tourist sites there’s a lot within a short distance from the city. Here are some of the best day trips from Paris at least in my opinion Table of Contents The Palace of Versailles Château de Fontainebleau Château de Chantilly Reims The D-Day Beaches Giverny Champagne Rouen Orléans Disneyland 1. The Palace of Versailles From its exquisite gardens to its lavish interiors the Palace of Versailles is truly a sight to be seen. Located just 20km from Paris it was the primary residence of the kings of France for over 100 years until the French Revolution. Once just a tiny hunting lodge it was initially transformed into a proper château by Louis XIII who bought up the surrounding land to extend his park and gardens. Eventually Louis XIV aka the Sun King turned this into lavish country estate as a way to escape Paris and diminish the grip of the French nobility. A massive and decadent symbol of royal power Versailles offers an incredible insight into French history highlighting the ostentatious lives of the former monarchs. The Palace of Versailles is one of the most-visited attractions in the vicinity of Paris with over 10 million people swarming the grounds each year. To avoid the worst crowds try to visit during the week. Place d’Armes Versailles +33 1 30 83 78 00 en.châteauversailles.fr. Open Tuesday–Sunday 9am–530pm with the last entry at 5pm closed Mondays. The Passport” ticket will give you admission to all the palace tours grounds Trianon Palaces and Marie Antoinette’s estate the Musical Fountain Show the Musical Gardens and the exhibitions it costs 27 EUR for one day or 30 EUR for two days. To get there take the RER Line C to Versailles Chateau or the SNCF train from Gare Montparnasse to Versailles Chantiers. 2. Château de Fontainebleau Located about 75km from Paris this is one of the largest royal estates in the country. Built in the 12th century it was inhabited continuously for over seven centuries and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site as well as a national museum. The origins of the palace also date back to a hunting lodge used by the kings of France with additions being built throughout the years the most elaborate of which are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Much like Versailles there are lavish rooms and apartments here including a grandiose and ornate ballroom as well as the throne of Napoleon. The château was also used as a NATO base of operations after World War II until 1966 when it was restored gaining UNESCO status in 1981. 77300 Fontainebleau +33 1 60 71 50 70 châteaudefontainebleau.fr. The château itself is open 930am-530pm to 6pm in the summer. The parks are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Admission is 12 EUR per person with discounts available. EU residents under 25 as well as any visitors under 18 can take the Grand Apartments tour free of charge. 3. Château de Chantilly This historic château is located just 60 minutes from Paris by car. It was built in 1560 by the Montmorency family one of France’s noble families. It is surrounded by some 8000 hectares of forest and has seen numerous additions over the years including a major restoration after part of it was destroyed in the French Revolution. When the last owner of the château died with no sons it became a public historic site. There are waterfalls and canals around the property as well as some fountains flower gardens and Chinese-style gardens. You’ll also find lots of sculptures outside making it a great place to relax and go for a stroll. The château is also home to the Musée Condé which opened in 1898.

By car the journey is just over an hour via the A1 or A3. 4. Reims This small city is located just 140 kilometers from Paris and has played a significant role in French history. Reims grew to prominence during the Roman Empire and when the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Reims Reims Cathedral was completed in the 15th century it became the place where every king of France was crowned with a few exceptions. Much like Notre-Dame in Paris this Gothic cathedral boasts two large towers. It was also declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. While in town don’t miss seeing the city’s fortifications a number of them including Fort de la Pompelle saw combat in World War I. You can reach Reims by car via the A4. The journey will take around 95 minutes. There is also a train from Gare de l’Est run by SNCF that takes 50-90 minutes tickets cost around 30 EUR per person. 5. The D-Day Beaches On June 6 1944 the Allied forces invaded Normandy in what is known as Operation Overlord. Almost 160000 troops crossed the English Channel that day. Today you can visit some of the remaining fortifications and bunkers as well as several cemeteries and museums. The beaches are located just under three hours from Paris by car which is the best way to explore the region as you’ll have more freedom and flexibility with your schedule. If you’d rather not drive you can book an organized tour from Paris that will take you to the main sites over the course of the day expect to pay around 150 EUR per person. 6. Giverny This picturesque village is 80km from Paris and is famous for being the home of renowned painter Claude Monet the founder of the impressionist movement. On a stroll through the famous gardens you’ll recognize scenes from some of his most famous works. It’s like walking through art history itself. Be sure to visit Monet’s home as well as the art museum! Many other impressionist artists also moved to Giverny making it a great day trip for anyone interested in art or art history. The journey to Giverny will take around 80 minutes by car via the A14 and A13. If you don’t have a vehicle you can take a train to Poissy and then take the bus but the journey will take almost three hours and cost around 35 EUR per person. 7. Champagne The Champagne region is known for — you guessed it — producing champagne. Only wines that come from this region are technically allowed to be called Champagne” which makes this the epicenter of all things champagne. Though a long day trip from Paris it’s possible to tour vineyards and sample the region’s wines in a day. If you don’t have a car you can take a tour with Walks of Paris which runs trips to the area. The Champagne region is located east of Paris. You can get there in just over two hours with a car via the A11. The trip can take around where between 1 hour 45 minutes and 4 hours via train expect to pay 25-50 EUR for a train ticket. 8. Rouen Like Reims Rouen has its own gorgeous cathedral. Built in the 11th century it towers over most of the city much like Notre-Dame in Paris. Rouen itself is most noteworthy as the place where Joan of Arc was martyred and you can visit her memorial not to mention other historic sites such as Château Bouvreuil. Rouen can be reached by car in just under two hours via the A13. Direct trains will take around 90 minutes and cost around 30 EUR per person. 9. Orléans This gorgeous city is located on the Loire River about 2 hours from Paris. You’ll find gorgeous medieval half-timber houses that really give Orléans a traditional European feel. There are tons of medieval buildings still in use many dating back to the 14th and 15th century. There are some incredible museums here too including the sobering Musée Mémorial des enfants du Vel d’Hiv which highlights the deportation of Jews and Roma to concentration camps during World War II and the Joan of Arc museum. Orléans can be reached by car in around 1 hour 30 minutes via the A10 or N20. A direct train will take around the same amount of time and cost around 20 EUR per person. 10. Disneyland Sure this isn’t the most adventurous of travel experiences but it’s definitely a fun one! Disneyland Paris 45km east of the city gives you a look at an American experience from a French perspective. Lose yourself in a world that’s not quite American and not quite French — but all parts that over-the-top Disney goodness that you love. Whether you’re traveling with kids or you just want to just relax and have a touristy good time Disney offers a great escape from day-to-day Parisian life.

Reply NomadicMatt June 6 2019 at 515 am Not at all! Reply John June 11 2019 at 1055 am Awesome post! I am going to Paris this coming weekend and looked for some inspiration. Now I certainly know some of the places im going to visit 🙂 Reply Dee June 12 2019 at 1047 am We took a train from Paris to Caen WHY don’t we have trains in the U.S. like this?!!! then rented a car to get to Omaha Beach which I highly recommend! Walking the beach looking up at the cliff where the Nazis gun bunkers not sure of the term are embedded really gives one a sense of what the troops were facing when they landed. Then the cemetery at the top memorial statues really really moving and profound. I don’t recommend not reserving the car in Caen ahead of time luckily for us a car had been returned during the night and they rented it to us! It was my first overseas trip I had ever arranged and I was winging it most of the time. lol. Also wish they had pointed out the difference between the speedometer and the speed limit signs. One was in kilometers Km and one was in miles per hour mph geeeeeez. I forget which was which but I still feel like I should apologize to everyone in the area for driving like a speed demon! Great list Matt. I’ll use it for my next trip to France! Reply Richard K June 13 2019 at 114 pm Yes The Palace of Versailles is wonderful and I would like to visit it just like these many castles. Visit a vineyard in the Champagne region a dream. As soon as my trip to Paris is planned your guidebook to Paris for budget travelers will interest me. Reply Clemens June 17 2019 at 849 am Damn why is everyone staying in Paris? There are so many things to see outside of the city. Great list Matt! Reply Glenn August 27 2019 at 806 pm I found the Palace of Versailles hard to enjoy due to the ridiculous crowds. We were packed in like sardines! Still it is an incredibly beautiful place and I really enjoyed wandering the gardens and the smaller palaces. I only had a week in Paris but would like to visit some of the other places on this list.

They came back glowing from life-changing experiences telling stories of new friends spontaneous trips to exotic locations foreign beauties weird” food and life lessons learned. Their tales made it sound like they lived through a coming of age movie. I thought of doing it myself. How exciting it must be! To be in a foreign country learning a new language reinventing yourself meeting foreign girls and being able to legally drink. For a college student it sounded like magic. But though I took the forms to fill out each semester I never studied abroad. Semester after semester passed and I let the opportunities slip by. Why? For a simple reason FEAR. I was always too afraid. I wasn’t afraid of what would happen or if I would succeed. No I had a worse kind of fear FOMO. The fear of missing out. I worried constantly that life back home would pass me by and I’d be forgotten. What changes would happen with my friends? What parties would I miss? What gossip? What if there was some big event at school and I wasn’t there? What inside jokes would I not be a part of? What if the President came? What if this! What if that! As a shy unconfident college kid I never wanted to leave because I was incorrectly afraid that if I left I’d come back and life would have moved on without me and I’d be a stranger to those around me. I didn’t want to hear stories from my friends about things they did while I was away — I wanted to be a part of those experiences. In my mind I knew I would have created my own stories abroad but I was too afraid about what stories I would miss if I left. So I stayed at home. And though I did eventually go traveling I regret not studying abroad. You can’t change the past. And maybe if I had studied abroad I never would have gone traveling later or made this website. You can’t be mired in what-ifs. You can only make the best decisions you can at the time with the information you have. But I regret the decision because I let fear win. I let fear rule my life. I went with the devil I knew because it was easier. I allowed me to stay in my comfort zone and never really test myself. I could always have the dream of what might have been” without actually having to do it. I put off a great experience because I was afraid of what the future might have happened. You can’t let the fear win. Fear is the enemy of your dreams. It was a hard lesson to learn but missing out on studying abroad showed me that you can’t let your fear hold you back. In previous posts I’ve written about how now is a good time to travel because of the economy and about how the only secret to long term traveling is desire. But even those with the greatest desire to travel can still be held back by fear. The Dutch have a saying He who is outside his door already has the hardest part of his journey behind him.” If you talk to any traveler they will all tell you the same thing nothing changes back home. People might get a new job or a new girlfriend. Maybe they will move. Someone might get married. A restaurant might close. A bar might no longer be cool. But the day to day life will be the same and when you know that you’ll thank yourself for not giving into fear. Life never gives you the same chance twice. Doors don’t reopen. Once they shut they shut for good. It’s easier to travel than you think. Once you take that first step out the door anything is possible. Whether it’s a two week trip to Bali a year-long trip around the world or finally taking the family to Disney get going now because you are missing a big world out there. I regret never leaving to study abroad. I can’t take back my decision but I can make sure I am never afraid to step out the door again. Because in the end what will you regret not going more than you’ll regret going.

Although its not travelling as such I’ve recently moved back to Scotland after living in London for a couple of years and have noticed that absolutely nothing has changed. Same people same places just a different day. Reply Sean June 17 2009 at 957 pm Matt All very true points. In a couple of my recent blog posts I have talked about how passing on great opportunities can lead to regret later on down the line. With that being said if you had traveled abroad maybe that would have set you on a different path and you wouldn’t be where you are today? In some ways I imagine that it was a good decision not to study abroad because it sounds like you are living quite the life at the moment. Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1220 am Well hindsight is 20/20 and the path I am on now is because I didn’t go away. That being said I still wish it was something I experienced but I do enjoy my life now Reply Tanya June 18 2009 at 1246 am I wish everyone could learn the nothing changes back home” lesson. So true. I cringe when people tell me they’re not going abroad because they don’t want to miss out on something back home. That’s just crazy talk. Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1227 am Reading the comments here it’s amazing how many people also felt that when they came back nothing has changed. Reply Dave June 18 2009 at 112 am Yep I can relate all to well. In college I told myself I’d miss school and my friends too much if I went away. None of my closest friends or I went away but after I graduated a few friends studied abroad in India and Russia and I even bumped into an art classmate while she was doing a semester abroad in Venice Italy. I was beyond envious. But if I didn’t not travel internationally in my early and mid 20’s I don’t think I would’ve been so motivated to save for a 20-month trip around the world which is about to conclude next month! Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1229 am dave good to see you here 🙂 Reply Brandy June 18 2009 at 128 am I can totally relate to this post. Back then I’d never been out of the country and was worried and scared that I’d miss out on something back home and/or be so homesick I’d have to come back early tail between my legs. Fortunately I did end up taking a little leap and studying abroad for a month in Madrid between my junior and senior year of college but my big regret is that I wish I would’ve known how much I would love it. If I had I would’ve studied abroad in a couple of different places. Then again I also wish I knew how much I loved traveling prior to college. if I had I would’ve majored in something more conducive to a lifestyle of frequent travel. And yet even after reading what you wrote the comments and my own experience with travel regret” here I am with those exact same regrets. It’s been four years since I graduate college and I’ve been seriously thinking about taking off now for like two years. Have I made saving money to take a trip a priority though? No I haven’t and I kinda hate myself for it. Here’s to hoping I can have enough fiscal discipline to finally take the plunge at the end of this year. Wow that got a little long sorry. This whole concept of travel regrets” really just hit home because I’ve been thinking about it non-stop lately and it was on my mind today especially. Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1230 am good! now get saving and get going 🙂 Your next comment better be from some far off country! Reply Todd June 17 2009 at 1006 pm Well said – I feel exactly the same way about not studying abroad during the college years. Fortunately I got a chance at a do-over” two years after graduation when I was sent to live on my own with no Spanish skills in Madrid for a few months of work – a life experience that was tremendously influential more on account of the personal lessons learned than of the work experience. I never hesitate to share my opinion that every college student should seriously consider study abroad – here’s to hoping your post convinces a few more to do so! Reply Sean June 17 2009 at 1009 pm I should also add to my comment that I too did not study abroad in college and completely have regrets about it. Todd thats awesome you were able to get a similar experience through your work! Reply Tim June 18 2009 at 234 am Matt Thanks for your post on this. With the way the economy is now is the perfect time to travel and have no regrets. If you do have regrets now is the perfect time to fix those regrets. I agree with the other comments who say that travel finds you when you are ready for it. In highschool I traveled to Moscow Russia for 3 weeks and didnt fully appreciate the experience till many years later. Now that I am working and can only travel 4 weeks out of the year I definitely appreciate my experiences more. I am working towards being able to leave the corporate life behind…getting closer every day and month that passes. Thanks for this post. Reply Laura June 18 2009 at 247 am Nothing changed! Babies were had marriages happened! For me my little sister is growing up without me – I can’t take her to see colleges or help with homework. I don’t regret I just wish they would freeze time while I’m gone – but that doesn’t happen. Also if I had done a year abroad I wouldn’t have started dating my husband! Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1231 am nothing has essentially changed laura. im home and everyone is still doing the same thing. Reply Graham June 18 2009 at 252 am I never spent a semester abroad when I was in school and it has always been a big regret. I could have experienced so much more of the world earlier in my life. Now that I am living abroad I’m so happy that I made the decision and I was able to overcome my fears. Fear really is the big thing that holds most of us back. And really it is like nothing changes back home. I talk to my friends and it’s always the same. They’re not changing or growing or moving on with their lives. It’s boring! Now I am afraid that I will go home and get stuck in the same way that I will never have a life as exciting as the one I am leading now. How do I move back to the US and still have a life that is always exciting and new and never stagnant? Reply Theresa June 19 2009 at 620 am I think it’s unfair to say that your friends at home are not changing or growing or moving on with their lives unless you have some really amazingly static friends. My friends at home aren’t changing growing or moving on in the way that I am but they are for the most part going down paths that appeal to them. They’re becoming wives and husbands and fathers and mothers they’re getting PhDs or Master degrees they’re succeeding at jobs that are important to them they’re volunteering with organizations they care about. Their dreams aren’t my dreams but my dreams aren’t their dreams. Life may seem the same to us when we get home but I think most of my friends will think their lives have changed often in ways significant to them since we left. I think travel is wonderful and important and I would encourage everyone to do it but I think sometimes us travelers get a superiority complex thinking our choice is better than others’ choices. I agree with Matt that you shouldn’t let fear keep you from traveling—if traveling is what you want to do. Reply NomadicMatt June 22 2009 at 153 pm The travel path isn’t for everyone but having no fear and living without regrets is something that can be applied to all. Reply Jac June 17 2009 at 1100 pm I sort of agree… I didn’t travel until my thirties. Then I did it big time. I got so much more out of it than I would have done in my twenties. And while I was at home in my twenties I was busy learning lots of things about life and love that I’m really glad I learned. I think travel comes and finds you when you need it and you’re ready for it. Do it too soon and you don’t get as much out of it although it is always amazing!. But do it when you’re ripe for it and it changes your life. Great post. Thought provoking for me. 🙂 J Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1226 am very good points Reply Rachael June 18 2009 at 340 am Good post. Having moved a lot as a kid I was used to goodbyes and was lucky to not feel these fears about studying abroad numerous times in college semesters in both Florence and Bangkok as well as a summer in Sydney. However I have just graduated am dating a guy from Sweden who will be leaving me in the States and returning to his homeland in August and am contemplating saving up for the next six or so months for a yearlong RTW trip. But now I am experiencing fears for the first time. Before I always knew I wasn’t leaving behind or sacrificing too much and that things would be the same. Now I feel I am facing the sacrifice of a future career and/or prioritizing an important relationship. Tough stuff! This article reminded me though of my fearlessness in the past and encourages me to be strong and push toward my dream! Thanks! Reply John Bardos June 18 2009 at 630 am I was exactly the same in University as well. It is easy to make excuses to delay what we really want out of life. Travel starting a business committing to a relationship following your dreams all have the same problem an uncertain future. Uncertainty is scary so people continue the same boring things they did yesterday and the day before. Travel reinvented who I am as a person. It completely opened my eyes to a whole world and different ways of living. The best advice I can offer is JUST GO! Reply Leyla June 18 2009 at 525 am Hi Matt This really resonates. I wasn’t exactly scared of what I might miss but I was scared I would miss the ‘career boat’ if I traveled after graduation. I’d traveled before but never on an extended solo backpacking trip which is what I so desperately wanted to do. Instead I was a good girl got a job rose through the ranks and all that – and finally at 43 it caught up with me – I quite the job gave everything away bought a backpack and a one-way ticket and took off for six months. I came back three years later after crossing Africa and Asia. So it’s never too late! And even when I returned I was able to jump back on the career wagon without any trouble – chances are I would have found a job after my travels the first-time around too. Amazing what fear can do! Reply Rob June 18 2009 at 532 am Accurate article I get regular ‘updates’ from home and they seem to be the same every week The temperature who’s ill what’s on TV. That’s it. In terms of missing things I found it works in the opposite way too people thought they’d miss me and I’d pretty much be out of touch but thanks to the internet communication is easy as it’s ever been even on a big scale so connections with home is just not a problem. Reply Jonathan June 18 2009 at 1118 am This blog reminds me of a quote that I heard last summer. It went something like this everyone has a disability. It’s called comfort zone. It prevents people from broadening and deepening their lives with new experiences knowledge information and stories. Travelling can help one to knock down the walls of one’s comfort zone. Reply Gillian June 18 2009 at 244 pm I don’t have any regrets as I agree the path I have taken has brought me here. But I have finally ‘grown the balls’ to do the travel that I have always wanted and like ‘Scribetrotter’ and at 41 we have also sold our house packed up all our stuff and set out on a trip that I had never imagined. We all do what’s right at the time. I may be older than all the others at the hostel today but I know that it’s never too late!! Reply NomadicMatt June 20 2009 at 123 am In the movie A Map for Saturday Brook finds a 74 your old staying at the hostel! Reply Anthony June 18 2009 at 305 pm It’s a funny thing about comin’ home. Looks the same smells the same feels the same. You’ll realize what’s changed is you.” Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Reply NomadicMatt June 19 2009 at 1232 am great quote!! good to see you here too! Reply Anthony June 19 2009 at 636 pm Buddy I’m getting that itch again… something is going down… soon! Reply Jason June 18 2009 at 940 pm Matt I think this is one of the most important aspects in life. Sometimes what we want most we fear most. Reply Aimee June 19 2009 at 107 am Thank you so much for posting this. I just graduated from high school and am preparing to move to London to go to a university there while most of my friends are headed to state schools that are only a couple of hours away. Lately I’ve been experiencing the fear you describe in that I don’t want to leave even though I know it’s what I need to do at this point in my life and I know that if I don’t go that I would regret it the moment I step foot on some other college campus. I really am afraid of missing out but after reading your post and all the comments it seems as if my friends are the ones missing out! Thanks again!   Reply NomadicMatt June 20 2009 at 124 am I’m glad this timely post was the push you needed! I expect lots of stories from the road! Reply Amy June 19 2009 at 214 am This is a great post. I agree that don’t let fear holding you back on seeing the world. For me I was traveling in the opposite direction. Moving to the States was probably one of the most terrifying and amazing experience at the same time in my life. But I have no regret. Reply JoAnna June 19 2009 at 1150 pm I always regretted not studying abroad too. I had the program picked out and the application completed but I never sent it in. I had the same fears you did and I’ve always wished I had taken that leap of faith. Because of that and because I realize we only live once I’m really trying hard to do the thing that might seem scary especially if it is the right thing to do. Logic says no my heart says yes. More and more I’m listening to my heart. How can I not? Reply Franny June 22 2009 at 1252 pm Hi Matty! Hope you’ve been enjoying your time at home 🙂 As someone who has lived abroad for extended periods twice in my life a semester in college and a year after college and now living as one of your friends who is home and ‘nothing has changed’ I have to say I agree with Theresa – ya gotta give us more credit! Isn’t that always true in life you feel internally like you’re growing and changing and others’ lives are only staying the same no matter who you are or what you’re doing? I might have the same job as I did before but it in no way means I haven’t experience as much growth this year as you have even if you can’t tell from the outside much like i might not be able to tell how you’ve changed this year – there goes Matt still vagabonding what has changed? I realized I have now gotten off topic of what your original point was – to let go of fear and realize your life isn’t going anywhere. I obviously completely agree but I just wanted to defend those of us who are learning how to have internal growth even though now we’re back at home. 🙂 Reply NomadicMatt June 22 2009 at 151 pm It’s not so much you haven’t grown as a person- I can’t say you have or haven’t and I wouldn’t be egotistical enough to make that assumption but ask people what’s new and they say nothing. Even when you inquire deeper people still have nothing new” to share. I think that is telling. It’s not true for 100% of the people but in general it seems to be the case. People are still following the same american dream path they were in the beginning. Reply Anne June 22 2009 at 844 pm studying abroad is the #1 piece of advice i give any young person i meet. i was lucky enough to have 2 semesters abroad – one in paris and the other on a ship around the world – both were very different but both will stick with me always. i’m glad that you’ve had more than your fair share of travel even if you didn’t study abroad. long live travel! anne Reply jen laceda June 25 2009 at 419 pm I don’t know how I have missed this post! Totally missed this from the feed. Anyway Fear is indeed a powerful thing. Trust me I know what you’re saying. I’ve been unhappy at my job for the last year or so after coming back from maternity leave which I didn’t get my old job back-they gave me something stupid to do-colleagues think i should file a woman’s rights case- that’s another story though. Anyway so Terence Carter photographer told me to find the things I CAN’T not do which is TRAVEL write & photography. So I want to do a career swticheroo but fear is holding me back. What about my sweet hospital pension? my healthcare benefits? etc etc. Can you smell the fear? But when I read posts like these I feel empowered and inspired and scared at the same time because it makes me want to take that leap now! Reply Judith September 1 2009 at 1054 pm Traveling can provide us insights about the other parts of the world. This can be one of the way for us to grow and to learn also our independence. Although you might miss something in your own hometown while your away but the experience is worth the trade off. Reply Calvin September 23 2009 at 950 pm Sometimes traveling to another place or country is worthy than the things that we’ll miss in our hometown. There could be lots of things that you’ll discover out there and you have the opportunity to meet different kinds of people. Reply John C December 22 2009 at 834 am I have just seen this blog and everything nomadicmatt says is very true. I just got back 4 days ago after travelling Thailand and Australia for 9 months. I put it off years ago when I just finished uni in London went to my home town and got a job. In March of 2009 I just went quit the sh** job and had the best 9 months of my life. I just wished I’d done it when I was 21 not 27. When I was out there I always missed my group of friends and my family people were getting married and I missed out on a few things. I was very homesick and always thinking I wished I was hanging with them. So I came back 4 days ago to pay off a few debts and yep it feels like I’ve never left. People are still the same and I’ve got my old job back as a temp. I just think that I’m picking where I left off. Buts its true that nothing changes back home. Nice blog!! Reply NomadicMatt December 22 2009 at 1041 pm Thanks for the compliments! Reply Mike May 29 2012 at 1241 pm Hey hows it going? I just came back from a two and half months stay in SE Asia. While I loved it I came back with empty pockets and no job. Since then I been working and planning on going back to school. Now I am looking for a University that offers that an exchange program so I can do what everyone else here is doing. Thanks for everybody’s input! I’m going to try my best to do something amazing! Reply kevinn g August 11 2013 at 526 pm the only thing worse than not doing it is wasting more time having ‘regrets’ about it . artificially created feelings that cannot change the past. Once a ‘time machine’ is perfected perhaps ‘regrets’ will serve some kind of purpose Reply Rob B October 22 2014 at 553 am I can totally relate to this! Part of me wishes I’d travelling in my teens and twenties just for the experience of it but as someone above said the fear of what you might lose can really take hold. I guess knowing very little changes comes from the experience of seeing it not change in front of you. Now I’m 31 and despite the regret of not going earlier I’m smart enough to now have an stronger idea of what I want and need from myself when I go travelling in March. The regrets will still be there in some way but the future and the past are just a thought what matters is now! Reply Dileshwori Joshi March 25 2020 at 217 am I can very much relate with your story. I have of fear of trying new things. I have fear of left alone. I have a fear of being forgotten. I have to think thousand times before trying out new things. I wish I could come out of my comfort zone. Reply Niks J. April 9 2020 at 817 am I also had the same feeling when I was in college. I was afraid of something. Now travelling. But plans failed due to some reason. I have also started writing travel articles and its good to share it.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share On August 2015 3 weeks after I got back from my trip in the middle east I flew to Madrid and started my 3 months backpacking trip in western Europe. I chose Spain to be my first destination because I planned to make my way up north by land. I ended up spending a week traveling from Madrid to Seville and ended in Granada. My whole experience in Spain was a bit surreal as I grew accustomed to the way the spaniards live. From having to wait until 3pm for lunch to enjoying free tapas with every beer ordered lets follow me and Ill show you Spain in 23 photos. Looking for a complete itinerary to Spain?10 Days Travel Itinerary for Spain Table of Contents Madrid Seville Granada Video Further Reading for Spain Madrid I arrived in Madrid at 10 am and I hit the ground running. I went on a free walking tour organized by MADride. Since I had absolutely no clue as to what to see in Madrid this free walking tour was a great opportunity to shed light on those in one go. I like how in Europe they have free organized walking tours that rely on tips and gradtitude from the people to create a business. My guide Sara from Latvia did an incredible job providing information while entertaining us about local legends. I would highly recommend you go on one of these free walking tours if you are in the city and you dont have a lot of time. That night I went on a pub crawl with MADride as well and it was incredible. Needless to say I woke up at noon the next day. I spent the next day walking around the Royal Palace and the parks in the area before hopping on the bus to Seville. Seville While I was on the bus to Seville I striked up a conversation with this incredible Spanish woman who told me about how she acquired her english-speaking skill by flying to the United States alone with no connection and worked as a babysitter. I found this incredibly inspiring because she was only 22 back then and did not know a single word of English! There are many things to see in Seville. The Alcázar the cathedral and the Metropol Parasol are a few things I saw. The highlight though was the Plaze de Espana which is a stunning red palace located near the Maria Luisa Park. Its vast space unique architectural design and its humongous size made it a must-see place in Seville. To make the place even better turns out the plaza was used to shoot one of the scene in the movie Star Wars! Usually something this beautiful would be crowded with tourists but that was not the case when I was there. Possibly due to its vast space and open-air style building it felt like I had the whole place to myself. Granada This is possibly the best city Ive been in Spain. With a more relaxed vibe the nature that surrounded the area and the people I befriended at the hostel I enjoyed Granada the most. As usual the first day I arrived I went on a free walking tour with a bunch of friends I made at the hostel. The guide took us through an old part of town and hiked up to Sacromonte for one of the best sunset spot you can experience in Spain. From the top you get the view of the famous Alhambra fortress built in the 9th century. Another amazing attraction was the waterfall hike that will take you through an incredibly diverse landscape of Granada. It was so great I went there twice! The trail will take you through several suspension bridges caves and small passages. Get your adventurous goggles on because you are going to get one here. The hike was also a good way to get away from all the annoying tourists in the city. You can get an incredible panoramic view of the landscape from one of the many outlook points along the trail. Some of the passages were so narrow we had to hung our bodies out of the side of a cliff with a metal handle bar. And at the end you will be rewarded with a beautiful waterfall and an extremely refreshing pool of water to jump into. This trail has no concrete endpoint so you will need to turn back at one point. I decided to turn back at the open area surrounded by canyons where people camp. The next day I was back at the waterfall again but this time we took a different route to a smaller waterfall hid behind bushes. We brought out our beers and spent hours having one of those deep conversation you get so often when traveling. My incredible companion of our second expedition exploring the waterfall trail. Before leaving Granada I decided to hike to the top of Sacramonte to watch the sunset again this time with a few more friends and unlimited supply of beers. Isnt this the best sunset or what? What an incredible journey it had been and that was only a week into my 3 months trip! I will surely be back in Spain again but this time I bid you farewell.

Israel is home to thousands upon thousands of years of history as well as key historical sites for the three major monotheistic religions making this a destination for millions of tourists and pilgrims every year. The country is pretty small and you can get around it very easily especially if you rent a car. It’s just 290 miles from Haifa on the northern tip of Israel to Eliat in the south about five hours of driving. That said some people don’t want to drive and some places out in the desert are hard to get to. For those people there are tours! There are lots of options from walking tours in Tel Aviv to multiday tours across the country and neighboring countries. I’ve put together a list of my favorite tour companies in Israel. They focus on different kinds of travel but all offer good value for the money 1. Abraham Tours Abraham Tours aim to suit independent travelers and give you lots of information about the culture history and politics of the region so you can be better informed while you travel around Israel. Generally aimed at budget travelers the tours range between two and 12 days in length and cater to those keen to go hiking experience Israeli food or head into the desert. The company has short half- or one-day tours like a Jerusalem graffiti tour for $28 or a kibbutz experience from Tel Aviv for $63. A three-day tour of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea starts at $146 a five-day trip through northern and coastal Israel costs $375. They also run dual narrative” tours of Gaza Jerusalem and Hebron which include activities like driving along the Gaza border exploring Jericho seminars on the Gaza-Israel conflict and video calls with Gaza residents designed to help you understand both sides. These one-day trips cost around $100. 2. Delicious Israel Delicious Israel offers small-group walking tours covering places like the Carmel and Levinsky Markets in Tel Aviv and the Machane Yehuda market in Jerusalem where you’ll be able to taste authentic hummus shakshuka and much more. There’s also a tour that includes a cooking class after the shopping part. Tours range from $90 to $120 depending on the length. 3. Bein Harim Tours These days Bein Harim founded in 1993 has over 70 tour options so it’s easy to choose exactly what you want to see and do. It offers small group tours — both one-day visits to all the major tourist destinations and multiday tours up to 12 days in length some including nearby Jordan. The one-day trips range from $73 to explore Jerusalem up to $125 to visit Bethlehem and Jericho. Multiday trips range from $300 for two days up to $2000 for 12 days for which you can choose options like the history and archaeology of Israel or a Christian-oriented package. 4. Intrepid Intrepid offers really high-quality authentic tours in small groups and focuses on staying in locally run accommodations like small guesthouses and homestays and visiting locally-owned restaurants and shops. Intrepid offers a dozen trips covering Israel and the Palestinian Territories from a five-day highlight tour around $770 up to 26-day journeys that also visit Egypt and Jordan up to $8000. It also has specialized tours including a nine-day Christmas trip and a couple of lower-priced ones especially for those under 30. 5. Bike Israel A unique and really enjoyable way to explore Israel is on a bike tour — it’s a country with reasonably short distances and the routes these tours cover varied landscapes desert areas dirt roads and seaside routes. If you’re worried your fitness level might not be up to it Bike Israel now also offers e-bikes. Tours range from a half-day seaside ride near Tel Aviv to multiday trips in the desert to cycling between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Prices range from $100 for a half-day the longer trips depending on the number of participants can be as little as $400. 6. World Expeditions World Expeditions focuses on thoughtful travel and wants you to experience cultural immersion on its tours. It has a focus on hiring well-trained enthusiastic local guides and also includes some degree of adventure. In Israel World Expeditions offers trips between six and 14 days in length. Some are self-guided hikes with transfers between trails and accommodation each day hiking through the Galilee and other beautiful areas starting at $1300. The longest tour takes in Jordan and the Palestinian Territories as well as the key sites of Israel and spends one night in a Bedouin camp for around $7000. 7. Mejdi Tours Mejdi Tours has a strong focus on cultural immersion social responsibility and giving back and its tours focus on travelers who want to do more than just basic sightseeing. The word mejdi” translates as honor and respect” which are values the company definitely works hard on. In Israel you can join various multiday tours each with a different focus. For example in 2020 it is running a ten-day multinarrative tour of Israel and Palestine in conjunction with Hands of Peace from $3900. As well as visiting Jerusalem’s holy sites and the Dead Sea this tour includes meeting politicians and visiting a refugee camp. If food is more your thing then Mejdi also has a one-week culinary and wellness tour starting at $4900 that includes an incredible range of eating experiences along with yoga classes and personal development. *** Joining a tour in Israel is a sure way to make sure you don’t miss out on learning all the cultural and historical nuances of this amazing country. From short walking tours of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv through one- or two-week trips covering most of Israel and neighboring lands and even specialized trips focusing on religion or politics or food or nature there are many fantastic ways to see Israel on a group tour.

While most used be located in Santa Monica or West Hollywood you’ll find hostels spread out all over the city now. That’s great because LA itself is super spread out and it’s a pain in the butt to get anywhere. Now if you want to stay in a hostel you’re no longer confined to just a few parts of town. The city is your oyster! I’ve been visiting LA for a decade and have stayed in dozens upon dozens of places. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Los Angeles are Location – LA is huge and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In LA you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable.

Comment /04/25/2020 Share Walking on the soil of Africa has been a long time dream of mine. Theres something about Africa that fascinates me ever since I was little. You see photos of rural areas in Kenya in your geography books and you gotta wonder what life in Africa is like. On 11th April 2014 my dream had finally come true as I landed in Johannesburg JoBurg in South Africa after a whopping 14 hours flight from Bangkok transiting through Mumbai India. Table of Contents Africa Travel Video Booking a Soweto Bike Tour Getting to Soweto from the Airport Where to Stay in Soweto Soweto Bike Tour Review An Excellent Way to Explore Soweto A Visit to the Apartheid Museum Africa Travel Video Booking a Soweto Bike Tour The first item in my itinerary was to go on a bike tour around Soweto one of the biggest historical township in JoBurg South Africa. I wanted to see the true African life up close with no filters and theres no way to do that in the city unless you come here to Soweto and see for yourself. I booked a 4 hour bike tour with Soweto Bicycle Tour. The tour costed around 450 - 500 ZAR ~45USD. They also do pickup from the airport but it costed as much as the tour itself. With that info out of the way lets begin our journey to Soweto Getting to Soweto from the Airport There is no easy way to get to Soweto however. You either have to organize a pick-up with the hostel or drive if you are renting a car. For more information on driving visit Directions to Lebos Soweto Backpackers. I personally chose to organize a pickup from the airport with the hostel as I didnt have much time. The cost of the transfer should be around 200 ZAR one way. A driver picked me up at the airport. While he was complaining about the distance I saw the remnant of the 2010 World Cup the FNB Stadium. Where to Stay in Soweto The Soweto Bike Tour is run by the only hostel in the area called Lebos Soweto Backpackers. Prior to arriving I emailed them to reserve a spot. The tour started at 1030 AM until 230 PM. The hostel is surrounded by high walls decorated with beautiful vegetation giving a very peaceful and private feel to the place. Theres nothing around the hostel so dont expect to go shopping and dancing anywhere in this area. For convenient stay at the hostel is recommended. Soweto Bike Tour Review An Excellent Way to Explore Soweto I was early so I gotta pick my bike first. Some are pretty decent but some are downright crappy notice the first one?. Beautifully decorated rickshaw. If you dont fancy cycling up/down hill you can go with the rickshaw tour instead. Same route but a little more comfy. Not my style however. These kids love approaching foreigners! The most surprising thing to me was that they didnt approach us for money like all the other parts of the world. They simply just wanted to play with us. It put a smile on my face every time I heard these kids shouting Hello from across the fence in schools just because they saw a foreigner biking along the road. Our first stop on the side of the road that gave us the view of half of the Soweto and the iconic Orlando power plant. Its a shame the bike tour didnt include seeing the power plant up close or bungee jumping off it for that matter. Meet my bru an awesome guide assistant who had helped me twice because of a flat tire on my bike. He smiled all the way throughout the tour. Such an awesome fellow. Our second stop we stepped inside the Shebeen as our guide explained the tradition of the Sowetan while putting us in traditional dress and trying out their traditional African beer illegally brewed in the Shebeen. Umqombothi is the what they called this beer. Its a traditional African beer made from maize and sorghum. The guide told me that the effect is nothing like the normal beer in supermarkets. The Umqombothi will go right to your knees causing you to walk astray instead hence the warning. Me in men traditional dress. Somewhat resemblance the Thai Boxing dress of my country. The good thing about the tour is that in put you right in the middle of the locals community. They were awesome! After visiting the local and trying out their beers we went to try a local delicacy. This photo captures the environment in which Sowetan are living in. An automobile among the simple life in the township. Introducing the Nshima and grilled meat. The ultimate local delicacy. The meat tasted pepper-ly with a mix of salt and spice. It was to tell you the truth more delicious than the lunch they prepared for us afterward. A must-try! The expedition consisted of Me Chasev a friend I met during the tour and a Dutch couple who had no trouble cycling at all.  This is the closest look of the power plant you will get from the tour. A Visit to the Apartheid Museum Me at Mandelas House. The house had been turned into a museum. The 4-hour tour didnt include the walk in the museum so we had to leave after a few photos. Got a special treat from these awesome street performers in Soweto that day. They danced and sang for donation and boy did I donated a bunch that day. As we learned about the history of the Apartheid a bunch of school girls asked for a photo of me. Once in a full moon do Asian travel around Soweto so it was understandable.  With these friendly encounters with the locals it set the tone for my African trip and made me fall in love with the African people even more. During the tour you will encounter children playing along the road and they will run after you for a lift to god knows where but nevertheless it was a really refreshing and fun experience. I asked the guide assistant to snap this photo for me with a little Sowetan girl with a pose. And thats the end of the 4-hour tour of Soweto on a bike. If you are want to see a video about the tour please check out our video that summed my African trip for your entertainment. The overall experience was superb and I would totally recommend you to go for it. You would not see anything like this elsewhere in JoBurg. I hope you enjoy this photo essay of Soweto. Next up we will go on a safari tour sleeping on tree houses in the bush for 4 days looking for the big 5 lion leopard rhino elephants and buffalo. The post will be up in a few days so stay tuned for more African adventure. Continue to the next part4 Days In Kruger National Park Tour With Viva Safaris.

It’s laid-back vibe awesome live music scene and rowdy nightlife make it a favorite for backpackers and budget travelers alike. Whereas many cities Down Under are worth visiting for a few days you could easily spend weeks here without getting bored. Since it’s a popular spot for budget travelers the city boasts dozens of hostels to cater to the growing tourist numbers. In my decade-plus of visiting Melbourne the hostel scene here has changed drastically. There are tons more hostels here than there used to be — and there are lots of upscale and boutique options too. These days you have so many choices it can be overwhelming. Over the years I’ve stayed in dozens upon dozens of hostels here. There are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. The top four when picking the best hostel in Melbourne are Location – Melbourne is a big city and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in central locations. Price – In Melbourne you really get what you pay for so if you go with a really cheap one you’re probably going to get a hostel that is small cramped and doesn’t offer great service. Amenities – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi and most have a free breakfast but if you want more than that be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs! Staff – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly! They can make or break a hostel! To help you plan your trip here is my list of the hostels in Melbourne that I like the most. If you don’t want to read the longer list below the following hostels are the best in each category Best Hostel for Budget Travelers Flinders Backpackers Best Hostel for Families The Nunnery Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers United Backpackers Best Hostel for Digital Nomads Tram Stop 14 Backpackers Best Hostel for Partying Base St Kilda Best Overall Hostel United Backpackers Want the specifics of each hostel? Here’s my comprehensive list of the best hostels in Melbourne Price Legend per night $ = Under $30 USD $$ = $30-40 USD $$$ = Over $40 USD 1. United Backpackers United Backpackers has everything I Iike in a hostel it’s affordable has comfortable dorms and private rooms is secured by key-card entry has a kitchen and dining room includes free breakfast with pancakes and has tons of places to relax and hang out. Its basement bar hosts events throughout the week and there’s also a TV room and a common area with a pool table. The hostel also offers a free walking tour of the Central Business District CBD which is packed with street art restaurants bars and clubs. This hostel is large so it’s easy to meet people as well. However since it’s so large there are occasional lines for the bathroom and the hot water can run out in the morning so wake up early or shower at night. If you’re staying in a dorm choose one of the smaller ones — the 12-bed dorm can get crowded. Located across from Flinders Street Station it’s easy to get anywhere in the city. It’s also just a seven-minute walk to Eureka Skydeck which provides amazing views of the city. United Backpackers at a Glance $$ Great place to meet other travelers Organizes lots of activities Free breakfast with pancakes! Beds from $35 USD rooms from $126 USD a night. —> Book your stay at United Backpackers! 2. Flinders Backpackers Another hostel next to Flinders Street Station Flinders Backpackers offers massive 16-bed dorms — a popular choice for budget backpackers traveling on a shoestring. For those looking for privacy there are also private rooms here but they are rather small. Free breakfast which includes a make-your-own pancake station is included. The hostel also has a large common room TV room with movie nights and free popcorn and a kitchen for cooking your own food. Every week they make a family-style dinner for the guests to enjoy a nice way to save some money if you’re on a budget. If you’re staying in the dorms bring earplugs especially if you are on the lower floors as there is a club nearby that can be loud. They also have a bar and restaurant on-site which has events almost every night. On Fridays they make a huge batch of Goon Punch an Aussie cocktail so things get lively. Not surprisingly this hostel is quite social so if you’re looking for peace and quiet you probably won’t find it here. Flinders Backpackers at a Glance $ Lots of social common areas so it’s easy to meet people Free breakfast Organizes activities every night movie nights free drink nights Beds from $25 USD rooms from $81 USD a night. —> Book your stay at Flinders Backpackers! 3. Base St Kilda Base St Kilda is far from the center of Melbourne but it’s in a perfect location if you want to stay near the water. Like most hostels in the city it has a free pancake breakfast a free walking tour and is own bar. The hostel is definitely a party hostel so don’t stay here if you’re looking for quiet. They host regular activities like karaoke and foam parties and the huge common room here has pool foosball and board games. As for the rooms they’re a bit cramped but still comfortable enough. Every dorm has en-suite bathrooms and the private rooms here all have their own balcony. There is also a kitchen but it isn’t huge there are no ovens so you just have basic options when it comes to cooking your own meals. The Wi-Fi works best in the common room but it’s not great in the dorms. If you need decent Wi-Fi head out to one of the cafes to use theirs instead. This hostel is great if you want to hang out and party by the beach. You can take public transit into the CBD which is easy to do and takes around 30 minutes. Base St Kilda at a Glance $ Bar on-site makes it easy to meet people Organizes lots of activities karaoke foam parties Pool so you can relax and mingle Beds from $26 USD rooms from $79 USD a night. —> Book your stay at Base St Kilda! 4. Tramstop 14 Backpackers If you want a chill place to stay that caters to long-term stays Tramstop 14 is the place for you they even offer discounts for guests staying longer than a week. If you’re passing through it may feel a little bit like you’re crashing someone’s house because so many people are staying long term — but don’t let that deter you! With dorms that sleep up to 10 as well as single and double rooms it’s quite affordable and a lot smaller than most of the other hostels on this list. As with many hostels in the city there aren’t enough bathroom facilities so plan on a wait in the morning if you’re not up early. The hostel has a small kitchen and a comfy lounge with Netflix and is much calmer and quieter than most other hostels in the city. It’s a good choice for anyone looking to relax and get a decent sleep. The hostel is close to the Rod Laver Arena and Melbourne Cricket Ground as well as the Melbourne Museum. It’s also a short tram ride to the CBD. Located in the more bohemian Fitzroy neighborhood there’s plenty to do nearby such as checking out the art and live music scene or relaxing at one of the local cafes. Tramstop 14 Backpackers at a Glance $ Comfy lounge for hanging out and meeting people Lots of live music nearby Discounts for long-term stays great for digital nomads Beds from $27 USD privates from $68 USD a night. —> Book your stay at Tram Stop 14 Backpackers! 5. The Nunnery The history of The Nunnery is one of the things that makes this Melbourne hostel so interesting. Built in the late 1880s it was an actual nunnery for over six decades. The hostel has both dorms and private rooms and also offers some extras like hair dryers and hair straighteners if you ask for them. They also offer free bike rentals too. The rooms aren’t always super clean and depending on what you book they vary from spacious and nice to basic and cramped. They have a small kitchen so if you want to cook make sure you get there early or there won’t be any space. There’s also a lounge balcony and courtyard for hanging out with other travelers. They host free events every day such as pub crawls and movie nights so there is always something to do. Free breakfast is included too. It’s Fitzroy location is close to Brunswick Street the Melbourne Museum and Carlton Gardens and it’s only a 10-minute walk to the city center. The Nunnery at a Glance $ Organizes daily free activites pub crawls movie nights bike rentals Large private rooms great for couples/families Courtyard for hanging our and meeting people Beds from $28 USD rooms from $89 USD a night. —> Book your stay at The Nunnery! *** While there are now over 30 hostels in Melbourne these hostels are the best the city has to offer. Whether you’re looking for a long-term stay as you sort out a working holiday or just visiting for a few nights a stay at these hostels will ensure you have a fun safe and social experience. After ten years of traveling the world I still love to stay in hostels. They add character to your experience and make it easy to meet other travelers. If you want to make the most out of your time in Melbourne be sure to stay at any of the hostels above. You won’t be disappointed. Book Your Trip to Melbourne Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

Posted 04/25/19 | April 25th 2019 Once considered one of the deadliest cities in the world Medellín has undergone a transformation over the last fifteen years that has made it one of the most modern places in all of Colombia. The city has become a lot safer there is a fantastic metro and cable car system that could rival the best in Europe lots of parks new buildings libraries restaurants and a growing tech scene. The city has changed a lot and you can tell the residents are very proud of everything they’ve accomplished. There’s a palpable sense of possibility in Medellin. Optimism and excitement were always in the air. Medellín is now one of it” cities in the world. Tourists swarm it and foreigners especially young digital nomads are settling and retiring here in droves. It was the most cosmopolitan and international city I visited in Colombia. I spent close to a total of three weeks in Medellín. If you’re looking to visit Medellín and I don’t see why you wouldn’t be if you’re in Colombia here is a list of my favorite things to do and see after spending so much time there 1. Explore the Numerous Parks and Plazas Medellín’s year-round temperate climate makes it a perfect place to spend a lot of time outdoors where people are always lounging around and vendors are peddling food and drinks. Two must-visit parks are Plaza Botero – Botero is a famous artist from Medellin known for his drawing and statues of oversized people. This plaza is home to 23 Botero sculptures and is always packed with people taking photos street performers and artists. Located in the Old Quarter you’ll find a couple of museums in the square too. Parque Lleras – Located right in the center of Poblado this park is full of people all day and night. There are street vendors food sellers musicians and people drinking into the wee hours of the night. It’s a wonderful place to people-watch and one of the best places to have fun in the city! 2. Wander Parque Arvi This park is worthy of its own entry. Located in the mountains near the city you can take the gondola right from the subway to the park’s entrance. It’s a beautiful ride through the hills and offers some incredible views of the valley and city. The park spans 16000 hectares and includes trails that date back over 1500 years. At the park entrance you’ll find a small market as well as trails to hike. To visit you now have to take a guided tour. It costs 5000-7000 COP $1.50-2.25 USD depending on the trail most trails are 2-4km long. Bird-watching tours are also available. 3. Explore Jardín Botánico The botanical gardens a quiet retreat from the noise and chaos of the city host numerous events concerts and festivals throughout the year. They cover over 14 hectares and are home to around 4500 flowers and some 139 different bird species. There’s also a nice if not overpriced restaurant in the center if you feel like spending more time here relaxing and taking in the scene. 4. See a Soccer Match Soccer futbol here is religion and if there are games when you’re here you should really try to see one. Medellín has two local teams Atlético Nacional and Independiente Medellín. Supporters of each team occupy bleachers at opposing ends of the stadium since things tend to get rowdy and violent when they are near each other. Ticket prices are well under 40000 COP under $12.50 USD. 5. Take a Day Trip to Guatapé Guatapé is the most popular day-trip destination from Medellín. It’s a colorful pueblo village situated on the edge of a lake about two hours from town and it’s possible to take tours of the surrounding area by speedboat or party boat which is very popular with backpackers who spend a night or two here. The main attraction is El Peñol a granite monolith with over 700 concrete stairs etched in its side. For a few thousand pesos visitors can climb to the top for breathtaking 360-degree views of the region. Guatapé is a long day trip from Medellín hostels in the city organize trips throughout the week so I recommend trying to spend at least a night here so you aren’t rushed and can enjoy the area little more. 6. Take a Free Walking Tour One of my favorite things to do when I get to a new city is to take a free walking tour. They’re perfect for getting an overview of a place while giving you access to a local expert who can answer your questions. Real City Walking Tours has a great free tour that will give you an informative introduction to the city. Don’t do any other tours this is the only free walking tour you need and it’s the best in town. You’ll get a lot of information and the guides are wonderful. Be sure to tip at the end! 7. Tour Comuna 13 This area was once the most violent part of Medellín. Murder drugs and violent crime were rampant it’s still not a safe area to visit at night. You used to have to go through guards to get into this area if you didn’t live here you weren’t let in. However thanks to its street art which was a reaction to heavy-handed police raids there has been a huge influx of tourists. That has made part of the area safer and led to a rise in business and commerce. It’s really changed the fabric of the community. Local residents are even coming here now figuring that if the tourists are going it must be good! You can visit by yourself or go on a tour where a guide will explain the history of the area and the artists. Some of the better tour companies are Comuna 13 Graffiti Tour comuna13tours.com Zippy Tour zippytourcomuna13.jimdo.com Medellín City Tours medellincitytours.com 8. Visit the Museo de Antioquia Founded in 1881 this interesting museum is home to numerous pre-Colombian works as well as national and international works by famous artists there are a bunch of Boteros here too and a wide variety of photographs and sculptures. Cl. 52 #43 +57 4-251-3636 museodeantioquia.co. The museum is open Monday-Saturday 10am-530pm and Sundays 10am-430pm. Admission is 18000 COP $6 USD per person. 9. Wander the Cementerio Museo de San Pedro Built in 1842 this cemetery is also a museum where you can see the monuments and graves of many famous Colombians while learning about their lives and contributions. There’s a lot of large marble mausoleums and statues here. Keep an eye out for special events such as midnight tours and movie nights. The cemetery is small but it’s also close to the botanical gardens so you can do both one after the other. Cra. 51 #68-68 +57 4-516-7650 cementeriosanpedro.org.co. Open daily 730am-530pm. Admission is free. 10. See the Casa de la Memoria This museum opened in 2012 and examines the history of armed conflict in Colombia. It sheds light on the struggles the people of Colombia have had to overcome to get where they are today. It’s a very sobering and solemn place but it offers some important insights. Don’t miss it. Parque Bicentenario +57 4-520-2020 museocasadelamemoria.gov.co. Open Tuesday-Friday 9am-6pm and weekends 10am-4pm. Admission is free and there is also a free audio guide you can download. Guided tours are available on Tuesdays and Fridays. Contact the museum for details. 11. Visit the Museo de Arte Moderno The Museum of Modern Art located in a refurbished industrial building is an awesome work of art in itself. There’s a ton of exposed area giving it a really charming feel. Many people have a love-hate relationship with modern art it’s not my personal favorite I admit but even I enjoyed my visit here. The collection is small but there’s also a beautiful photography section on the bottom floor. Even if it’s not your thing it’s worth spending a couple hours here to get a sense of the modern art scene in the city. Cra. 44 #19a-100 +57 4-444-2622 elmamm.org. Open Tuesday-Friday 9am-6pm on Saturdays 10am-6pm and Sundays 10am-5pm. Admission is 12000 COP $4 USD per person. 12. Take a Food Tour If you’re looking to taste a sample of what Medellín™ has to offer there are a couple of food tour companies that can help. It’s a great way to get a taste for the local cuisine while learning about the country’s traditions in the process. There are plenty of options such as street food tours from Toucan Café or more traditional local restaurant tours from Medellín City Tours. Both are good options! Expect to pay 143000-28600 COP $45-90 USD per person. 13. Visit a Microbrewery If you find yourself parched after an afternoon of sampling the city’s delicious cuisine consider taking a brewery or craft beer tour to quench your thirst. There is an up-and-coming craft beer scene in Colombia and Medellín has over 30 breweries and microbreweries. These are some of the best places to try a local beer 3 Cordilleras runs tours Thursday and Friday evenings offering five samples for 25000-30000 COP $8-10 USD per person. Cerveza Premium Apóstol has a tour every Thursday at 630pm where you can see the brewery taste a few drinks and enjoy a snack in the process. Advanced booking is required and tickets are 35000 COP $11 USD per person. 20 Mission Cerveza has great beer great food and it’s a fun place to hang out and meet people. They offer tours of the brewery and they also host music events and DJs. It’s super popular and one of the best places in town to grab a beer. Brew House is a family-owned-and-operated brewery where you can take a tour and sample the offerings alongside their full pub menu. Medellín Beer Factory doesn’t offer tours though it does brew its own beer with over 50 kinds on the menu! It’s a great place to relax with friends. 14. Visit Comuna 8 Much like Comuna 13 this area was one of the poorest in Medellín — and it still is. This district was really isolated until the city built a gondola from downtown allowing people to get to work a lot more easily. La Sierra runs a tour to teach people about the history of the area and unlike Comuna 13 it’s not overrun with tourists. It’s a small district and the tour doesn’t last long but you get a much more authentic look at the city and its people and history than you do in Comuna 13 where the focus is more on street art. I highly recommend it it was one of the most insightful experiences I had in Medellín. Finally Don’t Do the Escobar Tour! The locals here are not fans of Pablo Escobar. His violent life and legacy caused untold amounts of harm to the city and its population and while it’s always good to learn about the history of a destination glorifying this is not something I want to support. You can learn about his life online in a way that doesn’t spit in the face of the locals many of whom don’t even speak his name. Out of respect for them I encourage you to skip the Escobar tour. Where to Eat in Medellín I ate a lot in this city — and it was amazing! Here are some highlights Mondongo – Traditional Colombian food in a relaxed atmosphere. Try the mondongo a traditional tripe soup. It comes with a ton of side dishes including giant avocados. Come early as this place get packed. Try to avoid the weekend. Cl. 10 #38-38 Carmen – High-end gastronomy with some of the best food in all of Colombia. It’s expensive but worth it. It was the best splurge meal I had in the country. Cra. 36 #10a-27 Mercado del Rio – An awesome food court offering all sorts of delicious food from dozens of vendors. There’s something for everyone here. Cl. 24 #48-28 20 Mission – A great microbrewery with delicious food too! Try the IPA. Cl. 16 #43f-66 Pergamino Café – A chill café with some of the best coffee in town. I spent a lot of time working here. They make great breakfast food BLTs and empenadadas. Cra. 37 #8A-37 37 Park – Another great bar and restaurant with a rustic outdoor garden. Cra. 37 #8A – 4 Hatoviejo – This is one of the best places to get traditional Colombian food. It’s pricey when compared to some of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants you’ll find throughout town. Cl. 16 #28-60 *** I was never bored in Medellín. In a country full of hype this hyped-up city is all that it’s cracked up to be. It has enough activities to fill weeks on end. Combined with the low cost of travel and living it’s no wonder more and more people are visiting the city. This guide can help you plan your trip. And while it’s easy to get lost in Gringoland here try to get out of Poblado or Laureles and see the locals’ side of town. That’s where the magic of Medellín happens.

Here are suggested places to stay in Medellín Los Patios This is an upscale hostel but you get a lot of value. It’s in a great location and the staff are awesome. It’s always clean and the beds are comfy! Happy Buddha Boutique Hostel – This is the biggest party hostel in Medellín so if you’re looking to get crazy this your best bet! The staff works hard to keep people happy and drunk including organizing drinking games salsa classes and pub crawls! The Wandering Paisa – This hostel is located in the upscale area of Laureles which is the up and coming touristy area of the city. All the dorms are covered in South American and Colombian cultural artwork by local students and each bed comes with a large locker and a privacy divider which makes it easier to sleep.

Reply Anita April 27 2019 at 907 am I would be intersted to try the foods and beers. To be honest I haven’t tried any beers from this country. And yeah If I even go there promise to don’t go to Pablo Escobar tour 😉 Reply Tyler Johnson May 21 2019 at 1238 pm That’s a good idea to take a food tour in Medellin. I would think that would be a great way to try some foods that I can’t get at home. I am thinking about taking a trip through a bunch of places in South America and I’ll have to think about taking a food tour if I decide to go through Medellin. Reply Robert May 28 2019 at 711 pm Great tips thanks for sharing! I would mention one important issue about medellin. The air quality is terrible so if you have respiratory issues you probably want to avoid this destination. Reply Steven Tuggle January 23 2020 at 704 pm The air quality is only bad at certain times of the year when the winds won’t blow it North or South out of the valley. At other times the air is very clear and the views are spectacular. Reply Leigh August 1 2019 at 1035 pm I just got back from a 3 week holiday in Colombia of which 6 days were spent in Medellín which is arguably my favourite city! Thanks Matt for all of your suggestions especially the Comuna 23 tour with Zippy Tours and the free city tour with Real City Tours. They were both superb!! During the city tour it took us to El Centro and Botero park. Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to do the museums this time around and I had done a food tour in Cartagena so I decided to give it a miss in Medellín. Can I suggest for your top places to eat to include Verdeo a top notch vegetarian restaurant even the non-vegetarians will enjoy I guarantee! Happy travels Matt! Reply Tejpaal April 11 2020 at 1127 am Am vegetarian + eggs & fruits are okay can I get choices of food in Columbia or it’s difficult & only non veg food available ?? Pls updates me Reply Camille February 16 2020 at 635 pm Great suggestions Matt. Also appreciate your disclaimer on the Escobar tours. Not many bloggers mention this. I recently moved to Medellín & have found tours through Airbnb experiences to be some of the best. Highly recommend folks looking into them for local experiences. Reply Camilo March 10 2020 at 329 pm Great tips! but u forgot to visit the Parque Explora it is next to the Jardín Botánico. It’s amazingy!

Posted 03/18/20 | March 18th 2020 Since mid-February the coronavirus has spread uncontrollably around the world. Many countries are on complete lockdown. People are quarantined in their homes. We have an unprecedented shutdown of human movement around the world. This is a black swan” event an unpredictable turn of events that will undoubtedly change the world. It’s going to leave a mark on society and reshape how we interact work and conduct ourselves maybe people will finally start washing their hands more. One of the many direct consequences of this rapid spread to pandemic levels is that it has shut down the entire travel industry one that relies specifically on the movement of people to exist. Right now no one should travel. We need to flatten the curve reduce the transmission of this disease and ensure that we do not overwhelm our healthcare systems. No country can afford to repeat Italy’s experience. We must all do our part no matter how hard it is. The world will be waiting for us when this is all over.

Long time lurker here and I live in Japan and I had a flight to Osaka in couple of hours. The flight tickets and everything was so cheap and yet I was feeling very conflicted traveling at a time like this. Thanks to your post I was able to make the right decision and cancel it just before I was about to head off to the airport. Please take care! Reply Carol March 18 2020 at 814 pm Thanks for sharing your story thanks for isolating yourself Rest and take care of yourself Reply Jose March 19 2020 at 1130 am Hi Matt I am sorry to hear you have coronavirus. That must suck! 🙁 One thing I am a bit confused about though is that last year I saw articles your wrote where you said you make 7 figures from your blog and now your asking for donations? That just seems weird to me… And you do realize that practically everyone is hurting financially right now with millions of jobs being lost? You’re not the only one affected by this. Anyway I appreciate your website but I am just shocked that you would be asking for donation at this delicate time in the world. Jose Reply Rodrigo March 19 2020 at 221 pm Where did Matt say he had coronavirus? But you’re right this is not a good look for Matt. He is completely out of touch with reality. Reply salim March 19 2020 at 1132 pm he sent an email. when/where did he state he was getting over a million just on this? inquiring minds wanna know”.. Reply salim March 19 2020 at 1135 pm jose can you see?”- for the non-americans this is a mirthy take on The Star Spangled Banner- full disclosure i’m latino also- kidding aside where/when did matt stated about the ‘7 figures’? you wanna make a serious allegation so have to be prepared to back it up.. Reply Kevin March 20 2020 at 207 am The business might generate 7 figures in revenue but that is not the same as profit. If they also SPEND 7 figures he has like 5 staff members for example then it’s possible to make 7 figures but generate little or no profit. And Patreon is not for donations. It’s not a Go Fund Me type platform. It’s a platform for creators to share content and get support directly from their community. Reply NomadicMatt March 20 2020 at 1138 am I know it doesn’t always seem like it but this website is not just me. We have 5 staff one with two kids as well as freelancers we hire and pay. I’m not just sitting on a small stack of money asking for more. Like everyone else in the industry we are a small business trying to keep the lights on. Like everyone else we don’t keep a lot of cash around. It gets reinvested in our business charity and employees. We have zero income. Pretty soon we too will be the ones that will end up unemployed too. Reply Kathy Sadler March 20 2020 at 302 pm I love Nomadic Matt and have bought a couple of his books and have learned so much about inexpensive ways to travel on my tight  tight budget and am sorry he is laid up with the virus! THank you Matt from Kathy in Canada! ? Reply Jeroen Vogel March 22 2020 at 714 pm Is it weird Matt that people respond this way? The tone of this article is one in which a business owner who elsewhere boasts about his mouthwatering revenue now seeks financial help in a time where millions are a struggling. There’s nothing wrong with setting up a Patreon account but it might’ve been better to present it as an option for your readers to get more out of their ‘Nomadic Matt experience.’ It’s really just the tone of this article victimizing oneself that’s the problem. You might want to change that. Reply NomadicMatt March 23 2020 at 1230 pm While revenue does not equal income that is fair criticism on the wording of the post. I’ll give it a reread. Reply Jeroen March 25 2020 at 428 am It’s up to you what you do with it. Being Dutch my own wording in English comes across harsher than its meant to. I mean well constructively. You’re a lot braver than I am I feel a lot more secure being on a payroll beside my Dutch travel writing. Reply Dorsey March 23 2020 at 912 am Matt I appreciate the content as I am in the beginning stages of really traveling more. For the concerned citizens who think it’s absurd for Matt to ask for donations STAY OFF HIS PAGE! Is it now OK for us to enjoy everything without cost?! I will be donating! Matt is a blessing to travelers all around this world. Godspeed Matt! Reply Matt March 23 2020 at 356 pm Hey Matt Great initiative I hope it works out! Looking into this right now as your Patreon is very affordable and offers perks!

Even though we were driven to the starting point and it was a trail it was very steep and caused a lot of heavy breathing on my part! To start off had a lovely breakfast in the hotel very nice elegant room. Lots of yummy sweets sfogliatella is a traditional Napoli sweet and they had those delicious! mine had no filling but they come with all kinds. Had one in Salerno and it wasnt very good so was hesitant to try it again but its big around here so decided to try it again was happy I did... chocolate filled croissants etc... lots of sugar! We met our tour guide at 945 not really a tour guide a guy drove us and 2 other people to Vesuvius we bought our ticket into the park and then he drove us up to the trailhead. I was surprised by how steep it was not sure why as it is a mountain but I really dont have lots of experience with that sort of thing. The trail was made up of what looked like very small gravel but reddish in color not sure exactly what its called Karen thinks its probably a combination of ash etc.. there was a big rain storm before we got there so it probably made it a bit more stable and not so dusty and moveable which was nice. I took about 40 minutes to make it to the top as we kept stopping to take amazing view photos then when I saw the cauldera Wow very cool to look inside its very steep down into it and very deep no idea as to the depth. Lots of school kids hiking it and yelling to get an echo its the same in every language! We met our driver back at the bottom at 1240 and he drove us to Herculaneum another WOW its on a much smaller scale than Pompei by far but so well preserved. It was buried by mud 23 meters thick and it preserved wood and even some furniture. We saw skeletons of people that tried to stay down by the water to escape but one of the explosions produced heat of about 500 centigrade and they died instantly. We really had to hurry to meet our driver at the appointed time would have liked a bit more leisurely look through but it was good to be done also. After 3 weeks of busyness my body is really tired and Im very happy Im not sick. Will be doing some sleeping in hopefully when I get home! Right now its 630 and were waiting for the restaurant to open so we can go eat. Only the tourist places are open before that! So starved though as I am we are waiting for the place the staff here recommended. Will update yesterday when I can I wrote on it for a half an hour last night and then it crashed and nothing was saved! So since it was 1130 I gave up. Right now its 724 and Im off to dinner will update later! Wendy Fit bit so far today 16545 which is 7.13 miles « Previous Entry Next Entry » Advertisement Comment Subscribe Follow 0 Message Wendy H.

OK I am a very healthy guy when I am home in my apartment with my juicer kitchen and nearby Whole Foods. On the road it’s another story. Even with the high expectations and goals I set for myself a few years ago I’ve failed at maintaining a healthier lifestyle on the road. While I make more health-conscious decisions I still go out too much never sleep and stuff my face with pizza because it is convenient. To try to change that I met up with my friend Steve Kamb the legend behind Nerd Fitness a site dedicated to helping nerds stay fit. Steve travels a lot too and he knows how to balance life on the road with staying in shape. We sat down together to talk about all things fitness and travel. Here are Steve’s top tips for staying healthy and in shape while traveling. My Interview with Steve For more travel and fitness advice here’s an interview with Steve I did a few years ago. It’s full of helpful tips and advice and expands on many of the points above. If you really want to learn how to stay in shape both at home and abroad watch this video! 7 Tips for Staying In Shape While Traveling 1. Make Healthy Living on the Road a Priority! Yes you DO have time to exercise you just need to make time for it. You can complete a workout in 20 minutes in your hotel room or hostel using basic exercises — and you don’t need any equipment! Here are some simple and effective exercises you can do in your hotel hostel or even just a nearby park Jumping jacks Push-ups Sit-ups Burpees Lunges Squats Stretching/yoga Even just 5 minutes of these exercises will have you sweating. And you can literally do these exercises anywhere too. Where there’s a will there’s a way! 2. Walking for the Win! Do everything you can to walk as often as possible. There’s no better way to explore a city than on foot. You get to take in a lot more of the local life and it’s much easier to get away from the crowds this way. Plus it’s cheaper than taking a taxi or paying for a bus ticket. If just exploring at random isn’t exciting sign up for a walking tour. Most cities will offer free walking tours that usually last between 1-3 hours. Not only will you get an insightful introduction to your location but you’ll get in a lot of steps too! 3. Playgrounds and Parks Check Google Maps for a nearby park and walk over there for your workouts. Many parks have equipment you can use to work out with though if they don’t you can do pull-ups on swing sets or tree branches. Get creative! Also check websites like meetup.com for regular workout groups. Most cities have running clubs that host weekly runs yoga sessions in the park tai chi and other sports/activities. Check around to see if there is anything nearby that piques your interest and will help you stay active. Don’t be afraid to try new things either! Plogging jogging and picking up trash slacklining tumbling parkour — there are tons of unique options to be found if you spend a little time looking. 4. Diet is 80% of the Battle As a budget traveler chances are you’re working hard to lower your food budget. That likely means that you’re not eating well. Consider upping your food budget even slightly so you can eat healthier. Get some protein and veggies in your diet! Don’t be afraid to do a healthy family dinner” with hostel mates where you all split the cost. You can also try changing up your diet to better suit the local options. That way you’ll be eating more fresh produce while supporting the local economy. You can also make more drastic changes to your diet as well. It’s never been easier to travel with a plant-based diet and still stay healthy and energetic. That doesn’t mean you need to cut out all the junk or cheap drinks. But your diet is the most important component when it comes to health and fitness. Invest in it! 5. Do the Best You Can If you only have 10 minutes to exercise exercise for 10 minutes! Every little bit adds up and 10 minutes is better than nothing. If you have to eat poorly at the train station make up for it the next day. At the end of the day it’s all about progress. Not perfection. Do your best. Lay the groundwork for better habits. Nothing happens overnight but every step in the right direction will help you reach your goal. 6. Employ the Never 2” Rule If you miss a day of exercise for whatever reason don’t allow yourself to miss two days in a row. If you eat one bad meal that next meal should be healthy. Never two in a row. By employing the Never 2” rule you’ll be able to prevent bad habits from taking hold. The odd day off or cheat meal? No problem. But when it comes to staying in shape consistency is key. Try to keep your momentum going. You’ll see results much quicker that way which will encourage you to stay on track. 7. Have Fun! Don’t be afraid to have late nights with friends or say yes to crazy adventures. After all that’s why we travel! Just make sure you get right back on track as soon as possible afterward so you don’t lose the momentum you’ve built up. While it might seem challenging to balance fun and fitness it just takes a little practice and effort. Once you get the habit in place you’ll wonder why you didn’t start sooner! **** For more fitness tips and information check out Nerd Fitness.

But on the the road I don’t have as much time. So we just walk everywhere. We walk. A lot. I think our most we did was 15 miles in a day. Average 6 miles a day. I feel fit when we have a good walking route for the day 🙂 Reply Helen August 7 2013 at 756 pm Great tips! I agree with Nicole too lots of walking! I like to get involved in dance classes too you can always find dance classes whilst travelling and they’re a good way to get into the local culture too. Or cycling round a city is one of my favourite ways to see a new or familiar place! Reply Wil August 8 2013 at 643 am After I wake up and just before bed I do a few minutes of yoga followed by pushups and I’ve noticed a serious improvement in my health. Reply Shaun August 8 2013 at 955 am Great tips. Steve has an excellent website as well. There are many exercises available to travelers.

Reply Scott August 8 2013 at 929 pm I love to run when I’m home so next time I’m on the road I think I’m going to bring my GPS watch and shoes along with me. Running is a great way to see a city! Reply Kilee August 8 2013 at 935 pm Great tips! Indonesia has been doing a number on me… the food is so delicious and I’m finding most grab-and-go snacks at the corner shops lack anything healthy or without sugar even the crackers have sugar on top of them!!. Regular trekking/hiking is my choice when it comes to exercising on the road 🙂 Though there is a gym in the hotel we’re staying at now… might be feeling inspired 😉 Reply Beto August 8 2013 at 951 pm I can attest how even your best of disciplines get challenged on the road. When I’m not traveling I include a lot of fruits and salad on my diet so while going places I try to find a reasonable substitute. If I have access to a fridge I can get prepacked salads from supermarkets and fruits from a corner stall to get by for several days and to carry as snack in my day pack so I don’t end up settling for less healthy stuff or at least be less tempted. As for exercise I’ve always liked walking and oftentimes end up walking more than I could care to admit. Reply Jean August 9 2013 at 603 am Believe it or not I’m actually healthier when Im travelling as I engage in outdoor activities that I otherwise wouldn’t be doing while at home. I detest the gym and the only ‘workout’ i do when at home is opening the fridge– i built bicpes on that! On my last two trips I have been snorkelling freediving diving while eating probably Twice the amount of what I normally eat and still I lost abit of weight. So the solution is – keep travelling! LOL. I wish! It’s always much more fun to workout” without really working out like walking/exploring a new city/ hiking/ swimming Reply Jan August 9 2013 at 620 am Same here 🙂 The best work out is walking/exploring a new city! Reply Matej August 9 2013 at 846 am What about traditional cuisine? Food is a big part of travel for a lot of people including me and I want to eat as much traditional food as possible while in that country. Most include some type of carbs no matter the cuisine. For example asking for more vegetables instead of rice basically changes original taste. By the way in better hotels you can pay for one day gym pass. I used that often. Reply Kristin Addis August 9 2013 at 457 pm I went from certified Pilates instructor working out all the time to certified food tester and fried goodness eater in Southeast Asia. My issue is working out in that horrible humidity and heat. Not every hostel has AC. Would be interested on his thoughts on that. Reply Andrew August 10 2013 at 844 pm Pushups will do wonders even if you don’t have much time. Most days all i do is a set of pushups when i wake up and a set of pushups before i go to bed and i keep alot of muscle tone. I usually do 20 reps each set but do as many as your comfortable with. Reply Jack August 11 2013 at 646 pm I almost always more active while traveling but sometimes when traveling with those who like to hang out at the pool bar things can be a little tough so I always find time to walk. Taking an apple to replace the salty peanuts while flying is a great way to add moisture and can be pretty filling. Reply Arianwen August 12 2013 at 433 am There are some great tips here thanks! When I was training for a marathon a couple of years ago I was visiting Madrid and decided to take my camera and a printed map and run around the city. It worked really well. I definitely saw more than I would have otherwise. The only downside was not feeling like it would be appropriate to enter museums or places of worship in my lycra! Reply Olov Lindgren August 14 2013 at 334 am Becoming vegan has been a huge health improvement on and off the road. I strive to eat vegan when travelling but in countries where vegan food is scarce I resort to vegetarian food. This diet combined with a lot of walking is a great way to stay healthy. Sure I indulge in junk food and snacks on occasion but eating primarily healthy means the damage of that kind of food is greatly reduced. Another tip is to bring your running shoes with you when you travel. If your tight on space bring a pair of Vibrams or go barefoot Reply Sharalyn August 15 2013 at 359 am Thank you ever so much for this great video Matt! I am middle-aged and find the exercise thing a real challenge while on the road. The tips in this video were great and I really appreciate that Steve has a great balance with his life and understanding of what it is like on the road. When I travel I choose to walk everywhere. I wear an up bracelet” that tracks my steps and I average about 6 miles a day. Plus I have a power yoga DVD that I bring along and try to do that 3-4 times a week. I travel with my yoga matt…when I use a backpack I just strap it onto the side or I pack it in my suitcase. However I am going to check out Steve’s 20 minute hotel routine for days when I feel a crunch for time….although I don’t see myself ever doing a pull-up 🙂 Great post…thank you thank you thank you! Reply Martin August 15 2013 at 1202 pm Hi Matt you become more conscious of what you eat as you get older and taking regular exerciser. I find when travelling staying at most hostels this can go out the window when meeting people so this time I took a converted campervan around Spain staying away from tourist areas I found it easy to meet like mined people who liked walking and cycling and as you know the food is local and traditional. I lost over a stone and felt great! Reply Roberto August 15 2013 at 612 pm I think that in order to eat healthy and do exercise first it has to be a decision you make for yourself either you are at home or traveling. When you make that decision then when traveling you need imagination and determination whichever comes first. Everywhere you will find fruits vegetables water nuts tuna sardines canned its ok or local traditional food. Even in a gas station store you will find bananas but…have you the determination? Reply Skúli August 18 2013 at 1038 am Some great advice here I like the never two rule it gives you a chance to fuck up but jump right back on that horse again. That is often a problem with keeping a routine people thinking that if they screw up once the routine is ruined and they might as well binge on a liter of icecream after the burger and pizza. But that’s not the case. Just keep at it! Reply Burcu September 2 2013 at 654 am I especially like the walking part. If one walks to every walkable destination during a trip – that fact alone will take care of all remaining fir requirements. It is also a lot more fun to walk in a destination that you are not familiar with than walking in your own city. Reply Christine December 29 2013 at 457 pm Great tips. Its hard to find time to exercise while traveling but we do end up walking EVERYWHERE. There’s no better exercise than walking miles with a big backpack on! We end up carb-loading as well as having a big pasta dinner is often the easiest and cheapest. Good list. Reply Leia Chester April 9 2015 at 122 pm due to busy work I do not have time to fully implement a complete exercise but I usually spend 30-45 ‘to jog in the gym. That is quite favorable for the current situation but to recognize that outdoor exercise is always to best effect 🙂 Reply Samantha September 28 2015 at 223 pm Great tips Matt. My husband and I are heading to NYC next month and we will be doing a lot of walking. That should help with the extra we will eat while be on the road. The hotel also has a gym and pool which is great. I did like the 2 rule. Good for home or travel 🙂 Have a good one. Reply Lisa October 2 2015 at 1032 am Hey Matt Currently in Thailand and loving the food. I wonder how healthy fried rice is all the time though! A bit of Muay Thai should counteract the belly but god damn the fried food is good out here! Reply Catherine December 19 2015 at 604 am Thank you for your post! It’s very interesting and helpful! Especially the tips they are so great and not only useful but neccessary I think. But they also take time to get used to and process. But I think we totally can right? Thanks again. Looking for your next posts. Reply Leslie Carbone January 8 2020 at 209 pm I do crunches and burpees in my hotel room while the coffee’s brewing that way I always start the day with exercise. I also walk as much as possible when I travel. Reply Wes Pearce January 8 2020 at 224 pm I think one of the hardest things to do is keep to a regular fitness program and healthy eating while traveling. One thing I try to do is filter my Airbnbs to have a gym in the building. This definitely limits my options but it helps me stay on track with fitness. Or I try to search for local gyms ahead of time so that I know where they are and can save time.

It’s a country filled with incredible relics of ancient history from the Pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza and offers tons of incredible activities for travelers of all walks of life. Floating down the Nile River on a traditional felucca exploring the tombs of Tutankhamen and other pharaohs in the Valley of the Kings snorkeling and diving in the coral fantasyland of the Red Sea — there’s just so many amazing parts of Egypt to amaze and enthrall you. These days Egypt is a destination many travelers shy away from. Given that there have been some terrorist attacks targeting tourists over the last couple of decades and that people are still wary of the changes in government since the Arab Spring those concerns are understandable. However since 2017 tourism numbers have begun to increase again. In fact they are growing so fast they might hit an all-time record in 2019 or 2020. Things have been changing for the better in Egypt and it’s now a safe country to visit for the intrepid traveler. That means it’s time to start planning your dream trip to this diverse and historic country. While I am a huge fan of solo travel distances between the most popular sights in Egypt are pretty far. You can expect to spend a full day or night traveling by road or rail between Cairo and Luxor for example so joining an organized tour can help you make the most of your time. And it can also save you some money too! Tours in Egypt often work out to be cheaper than trying to put together your own trip as some will include domestic airfare for prices cheaper than you’ll be able to get on your own. Taking a tour with a reputable company also ensures that you’ll have safe detours with someone who really knows the lay of the land and will keep you informed of any risks. Knowledgeable tour guides also make for a more interesting trip — which is why tours in Egypt are so popular. Here is a list of the best tour companies in Egypt offering everything from day trips around Cairo to multiday tours around the country 1. Intrepid Intrepid is one of my favorite tour companies in the world. I’ve been on a handful of their tours over the years to destinations all around the world and have yet to be disappointed. Their local guides provide invaluable insight and they are dedicated to making environmentally friendly choices too. And the company just hires really awesome people too. In Egypt Intrepid has tours that range between eight and fifteen days. To be able to see enough in just eight days they fly you between Cairo and the south so the cheaper trip is actually the 15-day one which uses a mix of bus boat and train travel starting around $1200 USD. Intrepid also has some specialized offerings with a nine-day trip for travelers aged 18–29 trips especially for families and also one just for solo travelers. If you’re keen to explore beyond Egypt Intrepid also offers a range of longer tours that take in Jordan Israel and Palestine as well. As a reader of this site you also get access to exclusive deals and sales so click on over to their site and see what tours are on sale now! 2. Memphis Tours One of the first tour companies in Egypt Memphis Tours has been around since 1955. It offers a huge variety of tours – from half- or full-day tours in Cairo or Alexandria to snorkeling or camel-riding trips out of resort destinations like Sharm el-Sheikh ranging between $35 and $90 USD per person. They also offer a selection of cruises both on the Nile and on Lake Nasser. The popular Luxor-to-Aswan trip along the Nile can be made in a variety of pretty luxurious ships prices are around $500 USD per person for a four-day trip. Memphis Tours also offer fully organized multi-day trips that last between 3–15 days. Many of these take in the key sights like the Pyramids a Nile cruise and the Luxor and Karnak Temples and typically fly you back to Cairo. The costs vary depending on the extra activities involved but are pretty reasonable small group tours covering the main sights from Cairo to Luxor start at $1100 USD. They also offer some specialized tours such as one specifically designed to accommodate wheelchair users. 3. Look at Egypt Tours Look at Egypt Tours is another local company that offers both day and multiday tours. It specializes in having knowledgeable guides that make the history of Egypt really come alive giving incredible insight into modern-day Egyptian life as well. The company also has a sense of social responsibility too using locally owned restaurants and hotels on all trips and hiring guides from communities throughout the country. Look at Egypt Tours runs a variety of day trips out of the main centers including Cairo Alexandria Luxor and Sharm el-Sheikh ranging in cost between $50 and $150 USD per person depending on the destination and the group size. Multi-day tours include lots of options too these last around 8–10 days and cost between $1500 and $2000 USD. There are also some specialized trips like a two-week archaeological tour the perfect choice for any history buffs or Indiana Jones fans!. 4. On the Go Tours On the Go Tours has been running tours to a variety of countries for a couple of decades now but it all started in Egypt where the two founders met. The company focuses on sustainable travel and supports local communities and it hires local guides who have studied Egyptology at a college level as well. In Egypt they run several great-value group tours like an eight-day trip from Cairo to Luxor for $400 USD which includes the Pyramids of Giza the incredible Egyptian Museum in Cairo the temples at Luxor a two-night felucca cruise on the Nile a visit to the Valley of the Kings and more. Accommodations are more budget-oriented than many other tour companies making this a great option for backpackers. If your timing and budget are more flexible you might also take a look at some of On the Go’s festival tours timed to celebrations like the Abu Simbel Sun Festival or the King Ramses Sun Festival. These tours are typically around ten days long and range between $1600 and $2800 USD per person depending on whether they include internal flights. 5. Jakada Tours Egypt Jakada Tours is a smaller company that offers private tours as well as group trips with a focus on budget mid-range travel. Trips covering many of Egypt’s highlights and lasting between seven and ten days range from $600 to $1000 USD. If you’re on your second trip to Egypt or have some extra time Jakada also offers a range of more unusual tours like spending time at the Cairo camel market! The company also makes sure its guides are really knowledgeable not just about ancient history but modern Egyptian culture too as well as all the best local tips and tricks to help you make the most out of your stay. 6. Exodus Travels Exodus offers trips worldwide and has a reputable social conscience they aim to give back to the local communities they are a part of. In Egypt they support Animal Care in Egypt ACE and its tours often include an option to visit the charity’s facility. Exodus offers a nine-day Nile cruise from Luxor which is a good compromise between luxury and price around $1400 USD per person all-inclusive with a maximum of 20 passengers. The company also has a longer trip that takes in key sights like the Valley of the Kings as well as Alexandria this two-week tour starts at $2000 USD. 7. Beyond the Nile Tours Beyond the Nile Tours is another Egypt-based tour company using local highly educated guides with lots of historical and cultural knowledge. It offers three tours ranging between eight days and two weeks in length on all of them you can be flexible with your budget as some activities like a balloon ride over the Pyramids $100 USD are optional. All these tours kick off in Cairo with a full day exploring what we all dream of seeing — the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphnix — along with the Egyptian Museum to put the history into context. Then you’re flown down to Luxor and cruise from there to the Valley of the Kings among other places. On the longer trips you can choose to travel back north more slowly or you can include several days relaxing at a Red Sea resort. Tour prices range from $1200 to $1400 USD per person with some additional costs for extra activities. *** As much as I love solo travel planning a trip to Egypt is much easier with a tour company. While you probably know that you want to see the Pyramids the Nile and other historical sites getting around is not that easy to organize in advance so it’s good to have the local knowledge of Egyptian guides to make sure you’re both safe and getting the most out of your trip. So whether you’re after a short tour hitting the highlights of Egypt in a week or have more time to explore the country a little more slowly or even spend some time relaxing at the Red Sea you’ll find a tour company to help you out. Book Your Trip Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

And with more time behind me than ahead of me I leave June 19 as I look back on my time here I can’t say I’ve seen as much of Paris as I intended. I haven’t visited one new attraction. Or taken one day trip out of the city. Or gone to another region of the country. Or even the outlying neighborhoods of the city really. Nothing. I have taken five walking tours so I did something. But that’s it. That’s the extent of my explorations of Paris. But as I mull that over I realize I don’t really care about that stat. Because I’ve done what I came to Paris to do create a quiet life. My time here so far has been characterized more by writing sleeping and overall just generally chilling.” I’ve made a few friends — and thanks to said new friends exponentially increased the number of favorite restaurants and bars on my Google map. So I guess if I have done a lot of anything it’s eating and drinking. Every place every moment has a lesson in it. Every place is perfect for certain times in your life. Thailand was the place I need to explore my independent self. New York City was what I needed when I transitioned from nomad to non-nomad. They were the perfect bridges to a new phase of life. Paris is my bridge to a quieter life. But more than that Paris has taught me something about myself I didn’t fully realize until now I’m the most motivated when I feel I have limited time. I came to Paris guns blazing with a grand vision that I’d have all this time to explore. I was going to do so much. But three-hour lunches take up a lot of your day. So does work. So does dinner with friends. So do a plethora of visits from other friends. When you live somewhere instead of just visiting there’s always tomorrow. When I feel like there’s a tomorrow I’m less inclined to leave my comfort zone. I work read sleep and eat. So I always put everything off. I wanted to work anyways. I was in no rush. But eventually you run out of tomorrows. Suddenly you wake up and months have passed and you marvel at how quickly time went by. Now the clock is ticking down rapidly and I’m ready to kick things into high gear. With only about six weeks in Europe left and only half of them in Paris I’ve begun to book more walking tours museum visits and cooking classes plus trips to Bordeaux and Normandy. Booking all this in advance ensures I won’t find a work reason to skip it! Looking back I don’t think I’d change a thing though. I needed some R&R. Not only from travel but from life. I needed time to get my head right again. To wind down projects relax and get some motivation back. I needed to take a step back and hit the reset button. I’m heading to Normandy next week. After that I’m off to Italy. Then it’s my birthday. Then it’s home. For now at least. After that who knows? If Paris reminded me of anything it’s that I need to stop planning and accept that when I do make plans I’m likely to just do the opposite. I just need to see where the day takes me.

Sandi Reply Candice Walsh May 20 2019 at 1112 am I felt completely the same way when I moved to Berlin. SUCH a different experience than just visiting. The last few weeks of living there were jam-packed with doing all the things I didn’t get around to doing though. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same thing happens to you. Reply Carolyn May 21 2019 at 618 am Paris is such a great city to work and do not much in. The French know how to do things for joy or pleasure and not out of obligation and that’s something from the city I definitely take elsewhere with me! Enjoy the last few weeks. Also PLEASE got to Holybelly for a 3 hour lunch. Get the pancakes with eggs and bourbon butter. Thank me later.

I’ll be in Paris from Friday-Tuesday with my family and I would love to connect with you and buy you a coffee or something to chat about travel blogging for half an hour.

Your blog made me remind that time. Reply Zhanna May 22 2019 at 807 pm It’s a great summary of your time in Paris Matt. I like that you don’t regret any day of your quieter life here. However you made a good point that you always think that you have tomorrow. And tomorrow you think about another tomorrow. It’s interesting how you loose this concept as soon as the time becomes an issue. Reply NomadicMatt May 23 2019 at 539 am Thanks! Reply Rafael May 23 2019 at 1107 am Hey Matt Thank you for sharing your experience of Paris with us. Regarding what you commented in the post I believe that we are all moved by the despair of the end”. We begin to value things when we are losing. I do this a lot in my life in basically all areas. Enjoy a lot. Reply Aaron Salyer May 26 2019 at 407 pm Ha nothing like running out time to give you a little push. Think people are always underestimating the importance of time running out. We’ve changed our travel style over the last few years to stay longer at places. We constantly want more time! Now we aim to stay at a place for about 3 months at a time to really get the feel for it. While we’ve been focusing on tropical islands Paris is one place we’d love to post up for a few months too. Thanks for sharing! Safe travels Reply Mol May 27 2019 at 526 am Hey Matt!

Comment /04/25/2020 Share Luxor once the capital jewel of Ancient Egypt is my final stop during my trip here. This place is dubbed the land of palaces because there are several ruins and temples discovered in the area and after traveling 6 hours to the border of Sudan to see Abu Simbel this was a welcome change. I love Luxor. This place is filled with history laid back vibe and friendly people and if I were going to live in Egypt Luxor would be the place. Looking for a complete itinerary for Egypt?2 Weeks Itinerary for Egypt. Table of Contents Egypt Travel Video Where to Stay in Luxor Getting to Luxor and Exploring the City Visit all the Ruins Around Luxor with a Tour Visit Karnak and Luxor Temple on Your Own Getting to Cairo from Luxor Souvenior Shopping in Cairo Further Reading for Egypt Egypt Travel Video Where to Stay in Luxor Half of my satisfaction came from the hospitality provided by the owner of the Bob Marley House hostel no paid endorsement here Maria whom went out of her way to help us backpackers avoid getting scammed and providing us with the best information. The hostel is almost on par to European hostels in terms of services something I dont see often in Egypt. This is truly the best option you could find if you want cheap and great hostel experience. Be warned There are several hostels named similarly in the area that claimed they are THE Bob Marley hostel. They are not so make sure you go to the right place. This Bob Marley House hostel is NOT the one near the train station with a direction sign out of the gate. These guys were trying to steal customers in the dirtiest way possible by naming their place Bob Marley and putting signs in front of the railway station. Getting to Luxor and Exploring the City It was an uncomfortable ride from Aswan to Luxor. Since I had to buy my ticket on the train I was not assigned with a seat number and because of that I have moved around like a pinball to accommodate those who had the seat number. Fortunately the trip was only 3 hours long. Want to know what its like to travel to Aswan?2 Days in Aswan and Abu Simbel. As I arrived in Luxor train station the sun was already up halfway in the sky. I walked out of the train station and saw a sign directing me to the fake Bob Marley Peace hostel. Since I did not know that I followed the sign and found out that the hostel looked nothing like the photos in Hostelworld. I decided to whip out the direction provided by the hostel and made my way back to the main road and got myself to the Television street. I followed the Badr street and eventually found my way to the hostel. The staff gave me free coffee and provided me all the information without pushing me to buy tour packages like most hotels do in Egypt. As some of you may know I like meeting new people and Egypt has not been accommodating me in that front. The hostel I stayed in Cairo was empty and there were no hostels in Aswan so I was glad to see many backpackers at the Bob Marley House hostel. I spent that day walking around the area and exploring the Television street preparing myself for a big day the next day. Me Jess a New Zealander Kelvin a French and Sam from the States decided to go on a day tour hitting all the important temples around Luxor. Since there are 5 spots we had to go it was much more affordable to go with a non-guided tour than by yourself. Visit all the Ruins Around Luxor with a Tour At 8 sharp we were picked up by a coach for our first stop at the Valley of the Kings. Unfortunately it is forbidden to take photos of the valley. In my opinion the location was not very photogenic anyway. All the pharaohs are buried in a complex network of tombs scattered throughout the valley. Our second stop was the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut. It is a large complex of temples and tombs in the West Bank of the Nile. A friend tipped me about how the temple resembled one of the stage in a once popular computer games called Serious Sam. The path to the temple was so long we ended up running desperately to find a shade because the temperature spiked up very fast during the day in Egypt. The whole complex looked a little too clean for me. I like a ruin that actually looks like a ruin more. This temple feels new for some reason. Next up we went to Medinet Habu temple the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. After seeing many Egyptian ruins I have got the impression that they really do value the scale of their crafts. I mean.. look at this humongous wall carving! There were several more inside the temple complex. It was like walking through history when I walked in one of these corridors. Do you want to know how big these statues were? Look at the guy on the right for scale. The complex consisted of small rooms where you will both find hidden gems like this and an egyptian waiting to ask you for a tip. Very consistent of them. We also saw the Colossi of Memnon but it was not very impressive so no photos for you. Anyhow we spent that afternoon trying out all kinds of local food and saying goodbye to each other as most of them were heading to Aswan whereas I would be staying in Luxor for a few more days. It was sad to say goodbye to those guys but we made plans to meet up again in Cairo on our way out and we did. Visit Karnak and Luxor Temple on Your Own I woke up early in the morning got on a minivan as per suggested by the hostel staff and went to the Karnak temple for a few EGP. You can easily visit this place independently without paying a crazy amount of money for a tour. A pretty damn epic entrance featuring an avenue of sphinxes which leads to the pylon. These sphinxes are ram-headed symbolizing the god Amun. This is why I like starting my day early. I got the whole place to myself again. This is the Karnak Temple Hypostyle Hall which consisted of several gigantic pillars. It amazes me how they were able to carbon copied each pillar to look exactly the same with a very limited technology they had back then. The massive columns in the hypostyle hall dwarfed me. Can you feel any smaller? Many obelisks were constructed in the Karnak temple. One still stands as the tallest surviving obelisk on Earth. Sitting in the hypostyle hall being dwarfed by all the pillars really got me thinking about how awesome the human race is. We made the impossibile possible. After half a day spent in the Karnak temple my next and last stop of the day was the Luxor temple right in the city centre. It was only a few minutes away from the Tevelision street and so I decided to have a coffee break and went there right before the sunset. Theres a reason why I chose to visit the Luxor temple last. Luxor temple is one of the few temples that closes late at night which made it the perfect spot to watch the sunset. My guess is because of the location of the temple it is much easier for the police to secure the place at night which would be impossible for remote temples like Abu Simbel. Throughout my trip only Luxor temple is in the vicinity of the city centre. There is something about Africa that makes watching the sunset an unforgetable experience. I had a similar feeling when I was in Zambia and I had that feeling here in Egypt as well. It maybe because of the atmosphere of the surrounding that makes the illuminated orange light outstandingly vivid. If only there were some kind of explanation to all these carvings that would have make these temples more interesting. More pillars here but the ones in Karnak temple were much more attractive. As the sun set completely several spotlights were turned on to illuminate and create somekind of a light show. It was as dreamy as it gets. The good thing about traveling in the desert is that you dont have to worry about bad weather. The weather will always be cleared most of the time. It was totally worth it waiting and visiting the temple during sunset a truly unique experience. Michael and his friend made it to Luxor right before I left so we went out grabbed a little dinner and talked about how durable my camera was. It was still functioning like nothing happenned. Getting to Cairo from Luxor My attempt to try and fit one last activity into my last day failed as my morning hot air balloon ride was cancelled. We woke up at 4 am and by the time it was 6 we had to cancel it and turned back due to strong wind. It was a shame but I did not plan to do it in Luxor anyway.. my goal is to do it in Cappadocia in Turkey.  In the evening Maria was so kind that she allowed me to stay at the hostel until my bus leaves for Cairo at 9PM. She didnt even mind me using the shower before I left. I booked a Go Bus ticket online and went to the bus station near the train station an hour earlier. The process of getting my ticket was smooth and in no time I was on the bus with my free lunchbox bound for Cairo. Souvenior Shopping in Cairo I slept surprisingly well on the bus much more so than the train. I arrived in Cairo at 6 AM and went straight to the Freedom Hostel highly recommended where I Kelvin Sam Jess and Yan regrouped. We spent the whole day sleeping hanging out at the hostel eating takeaway shawarma from Kazzaz the best kebab place in Cairo. Joined us later that night was Bridget and Amanda where we went out and explored the nightlife of Cairo or whats left of it. Lets just say it was an interesting experience going to a club in such a conservative country. We went to the so-called best club in Cairo and it was a sausage-fest. Imagine buffed arab guys dancing to techno music in a dance floor the size of a dorm room in hostel. It was still fun though as Bridget shes from the States decided to show the Egyptian how an American dances at parties. It was hilarious! The night turned out to be pretty awesome thanks to the interesting people Id befriended in Luxor. It was my last day in Egypt so we decided to do some souvenir shopping. There is no better place to do that than the Khan-El-Khalili Grand Bazaar. As I was trying to pick up a few postcards from this one store the other store owner dragged me out and told me that his postcard is only 1 EGP each. I guess it is common to steal customers like this here.  After revisiting the grand bazaar it was time to wrap up my trip to Egypt. I said goodbye to my friends again as they were all heading separate ways and I would be flying to Amman the next day. Even though the ruins and temples were very nice I think I have had enough Egyptian ruins for now. I might come back to explore more especially in the Sinai Peninsula but not anytime soon. I flew out of Cairo to Amman Jordan the next afternoon and that ended my trip in Egypt. What do you think about Egypt?

I loved the time there and have always felt the country was really under appreciated. So in this is a guest post by Carrie Kellenberger from My Several Worlds and an expat living in Taiwan for ten years she lists out all the amazing things you should see and do there. Every country in Asia is beautiful but Taiwan is special for many reasons. The people are warm and hospitable. In March 2019 Taiwan was listed as the happiest place in East Asia. While it might be a small island you would be amazed at the never-ending variety of sights and fun things to do here. With over a hundred mountain peaks above 3000 meters over a hundred hot springs scattered around the island both golden and black-sand beaches nine national parks world-class museums glittering skyscrapers stunning temples and a huge number of night markets that are second to none Taiwan has something that everyone can enjoy. To this day nearly 14 years after I moved here I still think Taiwan is one of Asia’s best-kept travel destination. Here are some of the best ways to spend your time in Taiwan 1. Eat Eat Eat! The national pastime in Taiwan is eating. Taiwanese both adults and children are very work and study oriented so their lifestyles demand healthy food that is available on the go. Moreover there is always an abundance of fruits and vegetables so visiting a local market can be a delight when you find out how cheap it is to eat fresh food. As a result Taiwan has become an epicurean’s playground. The food scene is an international smorgasbord of culinary delights for every budget and almost every diet. Night Markets While there are five-star international restaurants of every variety throughout the country the night markets are where the real gastronomes go. They promise to keep your belly full while your wallet remains relatively unscathed. There are over 30 night markets in Taipei New Taipei and Keelung and over 70 night markets across Taiwan. If you’re not sure which one to choose visit this list of night markets in Taiwan and take your pick. My personal favorites are Shilin Keelung and Roahe Street in Taipei. Here are a few things you should try Xiao long bao also known as soup dumplings a favorite staple food here. They are made out of a thin pastry folded into a type of bag that is then stuffed full with a meat-and-vegetable mixture and a tiny amount of soup then garnished with raw ginger and soy sauce. Biting into one of these is a flavor explosion in your mouth. Plenty of street vendors at night markets offer fresh xiao long bao for around $2 USD for a basket of 10-12. There is really no reason not to try them. I’ve yet to meet a visitor to Taiwan who hasn’t loved their xiao long bao experience. I promise you will not be disappointed. Oyster vermicelli Oyster omelets Beef noodle soup Deep-fried chicken Tian bu la a type of fish cake fried with coriander with a dash of pepper and spice Sweet Taiwanese sausage or BBQ on a stick Stinky tofu Coffin bread” a tasty bread bowl shaped like a coffin Pig’s blood cake It’s made from pig’s blood sticky rice and soy broth and tastes much better than it sounds I promise! Shaved ice Zhen zhu nai cha Taiwanese bubble tea Taiwan Beer it’s the most popular local beer No matter what you decide on you’re sure to have a great meal at a low cost while experiencing Taiwanese culture at its very best. You’ll be amazed at what you can buy for dinner for just $5 USD! You’ll definitely find some things that you hate but you’ll also find things that you’ll love. It’s all part of the experience right? 2. Visit a Taiwanese Teahouse Tea culture in Taiwan is wonderful and there are many options for tea lovers. Maokong Gondola – This gondola will whisk you four kilometers to a mountain peak in a glass-bottomed cable car from which you can view the tea plantations built into the side of the mountain as you zoom up. You can catch it at the Taipei Zoo MRT station a ride costs 120 NT $4 USD each way. Once you’re at the top there are several winding paths for a pleasant mountaintop stroll and a great selection of teahouses to choose from when you’re ready to enjoy a cup of fresh mountain tea. Jiufen – If you’re heading out of Taipei Jiufen is one of Taiwan’s most popular tourist destinations owing to its appearance in the Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away. This seaside mountain village offers some terrific shopping opportunities as well as all the different kinds of foods you see in the movie. It’s one of my favorite places because it is also home to some beautiful teahouses in the most glorious setting. Imagine sitting at the top of a mountain looking out over the ocean in the comfort of a traditional tea house. It is truly a magical experience especially if you can get there for sunset. Go on a weekday to avoid the large weekend crowds. Jwu Jiu Teahouse – If you make it as far south as Chiayi be sure to find Jwu Jiu Teahouse a hidden gem that is like taking a step back into the past. Jwu Jiu is a traditional wooden teahouse set above enormous stone ponds filled with hundreds of giant brightly colored koi. Feed the fish while sipping on your tea and enjoy some traditional dim sum in the loveliest setting you’ve ever seen. The grounds belong to a local family and the teahouse uses a well that is over a century old in which the water still runs deep and pure. The owner has kept most of the original structures and bricks plus a hundred-year-old Osmanthus tree which is associated with many traditions in China and Taiwan. If you’re a history buff you’ll enjoy the teahouse’s long history displayed with pride and obvious care. 3. Check out the Northern Coastline Head to the coast for some incredible lunar-like landscapes at Yehliu Geopark. There are some unique otherworldly rock formations including one that looks like Queen Elizabeth though it took over 4000 years to form that are a popular tourist attraction. Try to get there early to beat the crowds. 4. Hit the Beaches The beaches of Kenting on the southern tip of the island offer fun in the sun. White Sand Bay is the most popular and a great place to soak up the sun swim snorkel or even go diving just keep an eye out for jellyfish!. Other great beaches are South Bay and Little Bali Bay. 5. Soak in the Hot Springs Taipei has its very own active volcano in its backyard and because of the volcanic activity in the area Beitou Hot Springs enjoys a steady stream of visitors and locals who love to bathe in its healthy waters. Prices start around 40 NT $1.30 USD per person for a soak in the hot springs making it a very affordable choice for anyone looking for some R&R. 6. Go Island Hopping The beautiful islands of Penghu just off Taiwan’s western coastline will delight your sense of wanderlust and are especially well known for their golden beaches. This island archipelago has islands that are all distinct. Boats will drop you off at one island for a few hours and then take you to the next one so you can literally go from snorkeling to observing sea turtles to wandering through traditional aboriginal villages made out of coral in a single day. 7. See Old Taiwan Two groups of islands that make up the Kinmen Archipelago off the west coast of Taiwan just a couple miles from mainland China — and they are old Taiwan at its best. Here you’ll be able to see some traditional architecture and there are also insightful museums that highlight the ongoing tensions between the People’s Republic and Taiwan. 8. Get Off the Beaten Track on Orchid Island and Green Island Located just off the southeastern coast these lush islands are a treat to visit. Here you’ll find hiking swimming diving and amazing hot springs. You can also get further off the beaten path and have an adventure by renting a scooter to traveling around the islands yourself! 9. Explore the Green Mountains Grab a scooter and head up into the green mountains which extend over five ranges the length of the island. If you want to stretch your legs climb to the summit of beautiful Jade Mountain and watch the sunrise this beautiful peak is almost 4000 meters above sea level making Taiwan the world’s fourth-highest island. 10. Visit Wuling Peak on Hehuan Mountain If you’re still craving some climbing and hiking head to Wuling Peak on Hehuan Mountain around 3275 meters above sea level making it another good hike for anyone looking to spend more time outdoors. But what really makes this place special is that the peak is so high you can look down into a sea of clouds below! 11. Go Hiking in Taroko National Park Ready for another city break? This national park offers visitors a chance to hike through mountainous terrain and gorges and you can even stop to dip your feet in swiftly flowing mountain rivers. Covering just under 100000 hectares it’s one of only nine national parks in Taiwan. Admission is free. 12. Head East To really enjoy Taiwan’s majestic beauty don’t forget Taiwan’s eastern coastline. The east coast highway has some of the most dramatic coastal scenery in the world from plunging sea cliffs and splashing surf to beaches nature reserves and rural towns a world away from the big city. 13. Witness Some Chaos Check out the feeding frenzy of the markets in Taipei or enjoy a stroll around cool Ximending the gay district and Taipei’s answer to Tokyo’s Shibuya. Ximending boasts a massive outdoor plaza behind the Red House a well-known cultural landmark and a pedestrian shopping zone filled with the latest fashion trends coffee shops restaurants and local artisans. Give yourself bonus points for checking out all the super cool graffiti you won’t find it on the main thoroughfares but if you venture onto some of the smaller side streets you’ll soon find yourself in world of brightly decorated alleys and lanes. 14. See Tianhou Temple While you’re in Ximending it’s worth stopping by one of the oldest temples in the city Tianhou also known as the Ximending Mazu Temple after the in-house deity Mazu goddess of the sea. Around since 1746 it’s one of three major temples in Taiwan from the Qing period. It’s located on a main thoroughfare — but it’s very easy to miss the entrance. Stepping through the entrance to this beautiful Taoist temple filled with mythological creatures smoky incense lucky goldfish and people paying respect to the gods is truly a surreal experience. You’d never know this quiet oasis is in one of the busiest areas of Taipei! 15. Explore Fo Guang Shan Monastery If you have your own ride in Kaohsiung I strongly encourage you to stop by Fo Guang Shan Monastery and pay homage to the monks that live there. An ultra-Zen monastery open to the public the complex is massive and stunning leading to the Great Path of Buddhahood a broad pathway flanked by eight identical pagodas. You can explore each as you walk your way up to the Big Buddha the highest seated bronze Buddha in the world. I’ve been to many temples and monasteries in my lifetime but this one takes the cake. 16. Visit a Taiwanese Aboriginal Village There are many knowledgeable local guides that can introduce you to the aboriginal way of life in Taiwan. The Formosa Aboriginal Culture Village near Sun Moon Lake is the most popular destination to learn more but it’s certainly not the only one — there are lots of villages to choose from. 17. Take Part in the Pingxi Lantern Festival One of the coolest events in Taiwan the Pingxi Lantern Festival involves releasing hundreds of paper lanterns into the sky. Many newlyweds also include this meaningful tradition as a part of their wedding celebration. If you don’t want to brave the crowds you can easily purchase a lantern and light one on any of Taiwan’s beaches. Taiwan is very environmentally friendly so make sure you go with the eco-friendly paper lantern options that disintegrate leaving no residue and don’t cause fires. The company My Taiwan Tour also currently offers biodegradable paper lantern tours in Shifen. *** There are many things about Taiwan that make it an incredible place to live it’s easy to take some of those things for granted once you’ve been here for a while. I frequently hear that people think Taiwan is very Westernized and while I agree that it is to some extent there are still plenty of authentic Taiwanese experiences to be had! Taiwan is and continues to be an unexpected travel destination that continues to delight visitors to this day. There is no place like it! Canadian expat Carrie Kellenberger has been living in Asia since 2003. She moved to Taiwan in 2006 and became a permanent resident in 2012. She loves entertaining guests and travelers to Taiwan. You can read about her adventures and life there at her blog My Several Worlds. Book Your Trip to Taiwan Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner or Momondo.

Black sand beaches nuzzled against rugged coastlines. Secret hot springs hidden in misty valleys while majestic waterfalls cascade from every hill. Welcome to Iceland. It’s a destination unlike any other in Europe. Its unique landscapes and natural wonders perfectly complement the modern capital of Reykjavik with its café culture and boozy rambunctious nightlife. Iceland is known as both the Land of Elves and the Land of Fire and Ice. It’s a country where you’ll find smoldering active volcanoes and vivid blue glaciers side by side. Horses and sheep dot the countryside colorful puffins flock along the cliffs and whales breach the choppy Atlantic waters that envelop this tiny island. It’s easy to see why Iceland has become such a popular destination in recent years all those cheap stopover flights have helped greatly too. And while it’s not the most budget-friendly country in the world there are still ways to see the sights without breaking the bank! If you’re planning a weekend getaway or want to drive the entirety of the island this list of Iceland itineraries will ensure that you see the best the country has to offer! Table of Contents One Weekend in Reykjavik Four Days in the South Four Days in the North One Week Golden Circle and Southern Iceland Two Weeks Exploring the Ring Road One Month Everything! What to See and Do in Iceland One Weekend in Reykjavik Day 1 Take a tour of the city I always like to start my trips with a free walking tour. They’re a fantastic way to see a destination learn about its history and culture and get all your questions answered by someone who knows what they’re talking about. City Walk and Free Walking Tour Reykjavik both offer great free tours of the city. They’ll help you get a sense of Reykjavik so you can decide what you want to revisit later. The tours are donation based so just make sure to tip your guide! Explore Laugavegur When you’re in need of a coffee or snack go for a stroll down Laugavegur a shop- and café-lined street in the center of the city. This is the oldest and coolest street in Iceland and you’ll find everything from expensive couture to dollar stores here. Be sure to stop in a bakery for a pastry or a coffee. My personal favorite is Mokka Kaffi. Visit a museum After that make your way to the National Museum of Iceland where you will learn everything you need to know about this tiny Nordic nation. The most famous piece in the collection is the Valþjófsstaður door a piece carved in the Middle Ages that illustrates the saga of the lion and the knight. The museum does a fantastic job of giving you a robust history of the country without being boring. If you’d rather visit a more unconventional museum consider a visit to the Icelandic Phallological Museum instead. Colloquially known as the Penis Museum this small institution is home to the world’s largest collection of penises and penis-themed art. Yes you read that right! There are almost 300 items in the museum including whale penises and allegedly troll penises! It’s a small museum but it’s actually incredibly informative — if you’re not too shy! National Museum Suðurgata 41 +354 530-2200 thjodminjasafn.is. Open daily 10am-5pm closed on Mondays in the winter. Admission is 2000 ISK 1000 ISK for students/seniors. Icelandic Phallological Museum Laugavegur 116 +354 561-6663 phallus.is/en. Open daily 10am-6pm. Admission is 1700 ISK per person. Go for a swim Once you’ve gotten tired of walking go for a refreshing swim in the Laugardalslaug Geothermal Pool. Swimming and saunas are how locals relax and unwind after work. It’s basically a national pastime. This pool is Iceland’s largest and was built in 1968. It’s actually a whole complex with hot tubs a thermal steam bath a waterslide and even mini golf! If you have extra time check out the nearby garden and zoo too. Sundlaugavegur 105 +354 411-5100 reykjavik.is/stadir/laugardalslaug. Open weekdays 630am-10pm and weekends 8am-10pm. Admission is 625 ISK though if you have the Reykjavik City Card it’s free! Take in the nightlife End your day enjoying the city’s famous nightlife back around Laugavegur. This is one of the best party cities in the world so there’s something for everyone. Just make sure to go during happy hour so you don’t blow your budget alcohol in Iceland is not cheap!. Here are a couple of my favorite hotspots in Reykjavik Kaffibarinn – This café transforms into a dance club on the weekend and it’s a great place to party. The space is divided into three different sections bar dance floor and lounge so you can find a section for however you want to spend your night out. It’s small so seats can fill up quickly. Bergstaðastræti 1 +354 551-1588 kaffibarinn.is. Lebowski Bar – Yes this is a Big Lebowski–themed bar. The inside looks like a vintage American diner and bowling alley. And since The Dude drinks a lot of White Russians its menu includes a wide variety of different ones. Its signature Lebowski cheeseburger is pretty good too. Spin the prize wheel to win up to 10 free beers! Aim for happy hour which is held daily 4pm–7pm as drinks are cheaper then. Laugavegur 20b +354 552-2300 lebowskibar.is. Slippbarinn — This is the first proper cocktail bar in the city and boasts live music and DJs several nights a week. Happy hour is daily 3pm-6pm. Myragata 2 +354 560 8080 slippbarinn.is. Where to stay in Reykjavik Hlemmur Square – If you’re looking to splash out this is both a cozy hotel and an upscale hostel so you have options for your type of stay. There’s a great bar here plus traditional Icelandic communal dinners several times a week. For a more standard hostel stay at Kex Hostel. It has a café and bar with an awesome happy hour a comfy lounge and a heated patio. Day 2 Explore the Golden Circle The Golden Circle — comprising the Gullfoss waterfall the Strokkur geyser and Þingvellir National Park — is the biggest tourist draw in Iceland so you’ll want to start your second day early and head out of town in a rental car or on a tourist bus. As tourism booms in Iceland these sites can get a little crowded so make sure you get there early especially in the summer and on weekends. The round-trip journey is around 250km so plan accordingly when it comes to food and fuel if you’re driving. If you’re driving you’ll also be able to stop regularly to see the many Icelandic horses that you’ll pass by. Experience the famous Blue Lagoon This is one of the most iconic destinations in Iceland. The pools are quite large and the whole area is steamy with the water a stunning milky-blue color that is rather photogenic which is why the lagoon is so popular on social media. It’s a beautiful and luxurious way to end the day and a great place to relax right before you depart. Personally I think the place is a bit overhyped as there are tons of free secluded hot springs all around the country. Of course if you’re short on time and don’t plan on leaving the city then it’s the perfect way to end your trip! Fun fact The Blue Lagoon is simply runoff from the nearby geothermal plant. Icelanders just found a way to monetize it for tourists! Thank you Instagram? Ha! Norðurljósavegur 9 +354 420-8800 bluelagoon.com. Open daily but hours vary so check the website for an up-to-date schedule. Admission starts at 9990 ISK per person but it can be cheaper if you go during certain hours. READ MORE How to save money in Reykjavik What to See and Do in Iceland Four Days in the South In addition to the itinerary above here are some activities you’ll want to add if you plan on getting further outside of Reykjavik to explore the southern region of Iceland. Day 3 Experience nature Head southeast on the Ring Road from Reykjavík to scout out some waterfalls. Be prepared and bring swimsuits towels a waterproof camera and a jacket. Reykjadalur – Stop in the town of Hveragerði to visit the Reykjadalur hot spring or hot pot as they are known locally. It offers a gorgeous backdrop of rolling hills and mountains and it’s free to enjoy. You’ll need to hike a bit to get there 30-40 minutes but it’s worth it! Keep in mind that there’s not a private changing area here so you may want to wear your swimsuit under your clothes. Seljalandsfoss – Continuing on the Ring Road you’ll come to the picturesque Seljalandsfoss waterfall. It has a drop of 60m and is another highly photographed spot in Iceland so try to get there early before the tourist buses. You have to pay for parking but otherwise it’s free. If you’re hungry there’s a food vendor that sells delicious lamb stew among other things. Skógafoss – Another epic waterfall is Skógafoss. Legend says that you can find a treasure chest behind this massive waterfall. This is also the starting point for a long multi-day hike but you can also just climb to the top and walk for as long as you’d like before returning. There’s a small museum nearby as well if you want to learn more about the history of the waterfall. Seljavallalaug – This hot pot is located a short walk off the Ring Road. It’s not super hot and the change room has seen better days but it’s secluded and it’s worth it just for the scenery as its located at the bottom of a deep valley. Make Your way to Vík Head to the charming little town of Vík and spend the night there. Vík is a seaside village with a glacier that covers the Katla volcano. It’s also home to some amazing black sand beaches and a DC-3 plane wreck in Sólheimasandur located on the coast between Skógafoss and Vík. Where to stay in Vík Vík HI Hostel – This charming hostel has a café/bar a female-only dorm rooms for families and a kitchen so you can cook your own food if you’re on a budget. Day 4 Chill at the beach Wake up in Vík and go for a stroll on the otherworldly Reynisfjara black sand beach. There are some offshore rock formations you can see from the shore and from the cliffs above if you feel like a hike. If you’re here from May through August you may even get to see some puffins! Take in the view If there’s time head up the hill to see the small Vík i Myrdal Church. It overlooks the town and gives a complete view of Vík and the ocean. Grab a coffee at a local café and enjoy the scenic vista. Head for home Head back to Reykjavik. See more sights chill in more cafés. Do whatever you want before you head home! sad What to See and Do in Iceland Four Days in the North If you want to get away from the crowds go north. Northern Iceland is one of the least-visited regions of the country and has a lot to offer the intrepid adventurer including majestic hikes more varied landscapes whale watching fewer people and a better chance to see the Northern Lights! Day 1 Travel north to Akureyri Start your adventure off by flying north to Akureyri from Reykjavik. If you don’t want to fly it’s a 5-6-hour drive from Reykjavik up the west coast which can easily be done in a day. You’ll just want to factor in a few stops along the way to sightsee! Explore Akureyri Take a self-guided tour of the town visit the Akureyri Botanical Gardens get an espresso from the picturesque Laut Café hop in the local swimming pool or just explore the relatively small town and sip on some kaffi coffee and happy marriage cake” rhubarb jam–filled pastry with a buttery oat crust from Kristjánsbakarí. Soak up local life as much as you can before you go! Where to stay in Akureyri Akureyri Backpackers – This is a laid-back hostel with a cool bar great staff and really hot showers! Day 2 Visit the Waterfall of the Gods Make your way to Goðafoss the Waterfall of the Gods. It’s a majestic semicircular waterfall that’s close to Akureyri on the Ring Road. The waterfall is over 12m tall and 30m wide and not surprisingly is highly photogenic! Enjoy the view before heading onward to Mývatn. Head to Mývatn Spend the day in Mývatn starting off with a hike around Lake Mývatn. There is an easy trail you can follow that lets you stretch your legs and enjoy the natural beauty of the region. You can easily hike the lake in a few hours if you go at a leisurely place. Then head to the Mývatn Nature Baths geothermal pool which is much quieter and cheaper than the Blue Lagoon. There’s not much else to do here. It’s a quiet town for relaxing but the lack of lights makes it a wonderful place to see the northern lights! Spend the night in Mývatn at one of the many Airbnbs guesthouses or farm stays in the region. Day 3 Pretend you’re on Mars Next you’ll want to head toward the coastal town of Húsavík. On your way there stop at Hverir and Krafla two geothermal areas with Martian-like craters and lakes. Steaming sulfur fills the air giving this whole area an otherworldly ambience. You can just stop to take photos or go for another hike. Visit Dettifoss Next head to Dettifoss Europe’s most powerful waterfall. There are two roads leading here from the Ring Road 862 and 864. The latter is ridden with potholes but in my opinion offers the better view. Just drive slowly and keep an eye on your tires! Enjoy a snack by the waterfall and take in the scene. When you’re ready drive to Húsavík you can take the 864 north from Dettifoss. Visit the Whale Museum Whaling has been a part of Icelandic culture for centuries. And while there is a global moratorium on hunting whales it’s still worth learning about these massive creatures their habitat and their impact on the country. They also have a full blue whale skeleton! Hafnarstétt 1 +354 414-2800 hvalasafn.is/en. Open daily with hours varying depending on the season. Admission is 2000 ISK per person with discounts available for seniors families and kids. If you go whale-watching with Gentle Giants you’ll get 20% off your museum ticket. Where to stay Spend the night in sleepy Húsavík at a local guesthouse or Airbnb. If it’s northern lights season stay at Arbot HI Hostel. The hostel is in a relatively secluded spot outside of town so you’ll have a great view of the dancing lights without having to worry about light pollution. Day 4 Watch the whales and explore the coast Wake up early head to the coast and go whale-watching. There are a few different companies you can book tours with here including Gentle Giants who have a partnership with the Whale Museum see above. Whale-watching tours usually last around 3 hours. Expect to pay around 10400 ISK for adults and 4400 ISK for children. When you’re done explore the hiking trails around Húsavík. You can find a list of the trails on the Visit Húsavík website. Pop into some of the local shops and cafés to get a sense of small-town life here in Northern Iceland. See some unique architecture Travel to nearby Laufás which is located west of Húsavík. Here you’ll get to see the old turf houses traditional Icelandic homes that are timber framed and covered in grass. The furnishings are from around 1900 and you’ll feel like you’ve traveled back in time. While in Laufás take a small detour and check out the church. Inside is a decorative pulpit from 1698! Have an Icelandic feast Go back to Akureyri to explore the city and dine on fresh fish and chips from Akureyri Fish & Chips. Don’t forget to sample the country’s famous ice cream from Brynja too! Note I know it sounds like a lot but if you have a car this itinerary is very doable. What to Do In One Week in Iceland Golden Circle and Southern Iceland Day 1-2 Head East Fly into Keflavík International Airport and rent a car SAD Cars and Car Rental Iceland are the companies I recommend. Head east from Reykjavík along the Ring Road to start your adventure! Soak in the hot springs and search for puffins Head east for a soak in the Reykjadalur hot springs in Hveragerði. Camp or stay at the hostel nearby so you can get another soak in before heading onward. To get a bit off the beaten trail take the ferry to the Westman Islands for the afternoon or an overnight stay you’ll find plenty of puffins here during the summer season!. There are very few tourists here so it’s a nice way to escape the crowds and relax. Chase some waterfalls Venturing onward along the Ring Road head to Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss waterfalls. At Skógafoss the 29km Fimmvörðuháls Trail begins. If you want to hike the entire trail you can stay at the Volcano Huts at the end of the route and then take a bus back to Skógafoss in the morning. If you’re fit you can do this hike in a day. Otherwise you’ll need to bring tents and camp halfway. If an epic hike isn’t in the cards stroll around the area before continuing east toward Vík. Tour a crash site Before you get to Vík you’ll want to check out the DC-3 plane wreck in Sólheimasandur. It’s about a 45-minute walk from the Ring Road but it’s worth it to see the crash up close you can no longer drive directly to the site. Dress appropriately as it can get windy near the coastline. Spot puffins Continue on to Vík and stop to see the black sand beaches. There are also two short hikes nearby that take you up the cliffs. They offer incredible views of the areas and if it’s the right season you can go puffin spotting! Where to stay For your first night stay at the Hot Springs Hostel in Hveragerði right near the hot spring. That way you can wake up early and go for another soak before you leave. If you’re on the Westman Islands stay at Aska Hostel or book one of the many private guesthouses for a cozy local experience. When you get to Vik stay at Vík HI Hostel. Days 3-4 Hike Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon This 2km-long canyon dates back to the Ice Age. It’s over 100m deep and makes for a great place to hike or have a picnic and enjoy the view. The road to get there is full of potholes so drive carefully. Explore Vatnajökull National Park Hike in the Skaftafell wilderness area to see the glaciers of Vatnajökull National Park. There are plenty of hikes here both long and short for outdoorsy types. For a shorter hike head to Svartifoss another photogenic waterfall surrounded by long columns of black basalt the waterfall’s name literally translates to the black waterfall”. Klapparstígur 25-27 +354 575-8400 vatnajokulsthjodgardur.is. The park itself is open 24/7 however the Skaftafell visitors center has limited hours usually 9am-7pm in the summer and 10am-6pm in the winter. See the website for more details including camping information and weather updates. Parking is 750 ISK per vehicle per day. Visit Jökulsárlón Lagoon The Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon borders the national park and you don’t want to miss it. The waters are blue and there are huge icebergs from the nearby glacier floating in the water. The lagoon flows into the Atlantic Ocean and you’ll see lots of seals in the winter. You can follow the stream out to sea and watch the glaciers as they meet the ocean. Best of all this is right on the Ring Road and it’s all completely free though if you want to take a boat out into the lagoon you’ll have to pay — I don’t think it’s worth doing though! Tour the coast Continue on the Ring Road to Höfn or Djúpivogur two tiny coastal towns. Get a taste of what life is like in small-town Iceland while exploring the winding coastline. There’s a hidden hot spring outside of Djúpivogur to reward you for making it so far up the coast too! Where to stay If you’re ending your day in Höfn stay at Höfn Hostel. You can see the Vatnajökull Glacier from the town and everything is within walking distance. If you’re heading on to Djúpivogur Airbnb will be your best choice. Days 5-7 Return to Reykjavík Hop in the car and head back to the capital city. Stroll the cozy streets take a free walking tour and enjoy some of the city’s plentiful happy hours. See the Golden Circle Wake up early and drive out to see the three main sites of the Golden Circle. The sooner you start the better as you’ll be able to beat the tourist buses there and get some photos without the crowds. You’ll also have time to hike in Þingvellir National Park if you want to stretch your legs. Stock up on snacks for the day in Reykjavik to save some money the cheapest supermarket is Bonus so shop there!. Relax at the Blue Lagoon If you’re craving another dip in a hot pot head to the Blue Lagoon before your flight home. You’ll be able to end the trip on a very relaxing note! Two Weeks Exploring the Ring Road With two weeks you will be able to drive the entire Ring Road without rushing too much. You’ll have time to enjoy the rugged east coast and places like Seydisfjordur explore the second-largest city Akureyri hike around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and maybe even dip into the Westfjords. Start in Rekyavik head east see Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss explore Vík visit the Jökulsárlón Lagoon detour over to Seyðisfjörður then head over to Dettifoss Mývatn Goðafoss and Akureyri. After exploring Akureyri continue west to the Snæfellsnes Peninsula for some hiking. Make sure you stop off to see the iconic Kirkjufell mountain which is one of the most photographed spots in all of Iceland plus it’s where they filmed some Game of Thrones scenes too. Snæfellsnes National Park is home to Snæfellsjökull a 700000-year-old volcano capped by glaciers. You can book a glacier hike here or just explore the rest of the park on your own. It’s right along the coast too so you’ll be met with some gorgeous views. Stay at The Freezer hostel it has great live music. If you have time and want to get off the beaten trail detour into the Westfjords in the northwest or visit the Westman Islands off the south coast. If you want to be more focused on your trip you can split Iceland up into smaller geographic areas. One fun route to take is to head west to the Snæfellsnes Peninsula then up into the Westfjords for some hiking and relaxing before flying back to the capital. This will be the most remote part of the country so you’ll have a lot more space and privacy to enjoy your trip. One Month Exploring All of Iceland With one month you can see the entire island of Iceland. I’ve met quite a few people who have decided to spend this amount of time in the summer months. They’ll rent a car or camper van pack a bunch of camping gear and drive the Ring Road at a leisurely pace. But even if you aren’t renting a van or car you can get around by bus air or hitchhike! Take multi-day hikes visit to the less-explored Westfjords an area many tourists skip due to a lack of time and paved roads visit Hrísey and/or Grímsey the very remote islands in the north with fewer than 100 inhabitants each or the Westman Islands or explore more parks in the interior of the country it’s very remote very unvisited and very very awesome. If you’re traveling on a shoestring budget and planning to camp and hitchhike in Iceland you’ll need this longer travel time to make sure you aren’t rushed as sometimes you’ll be waiting awhile for a lift. But with a month here there’s very little you can’t explore! *** Iceland really does have something for everyone. Whether you’re visiting for a weekend or spending an entire month exploring this rugged landscape you’ll be able to have an amazing experience.

There are many airlines that fly from the US directly to Spain such as American Delta Iberia or Air Europa. If you are from Asia Emirates Qatar or KLM are great options too. To find the cheapest flight to Spain make sure to browse through Skyscanner or Momondo so you can get the cheapest flight from your home country to Spain. How to Get Around Spain Buses are easy and cheap to travel in around Spain. ALSA Flixbus or if you are looking for a one-stop shop at finding buses check out Omio.com to easily find and book a bus ticket online for your trip in Spain. For big cities like Madrid and Barcelona the metro system is really well-connected although be aware that there are a lot of pickpockets around crowded stations in Madrid and Barcelona so be sure to watch your belonging when getting on/off the train. The train should cost around 2 - 3 EUR per trip. For Seville you can walk to all the tourist attractions in the city no problem. Same goes for Granada but if you want to go hiking you can also rely on the local bus system which is well-connected and easily accessible. Be sure to ask your hostel/hotel for information on which bus number to take to go somewhere. Once you know the bus number you can check the bus schedule online here. Daily Budget Traveling here on average will cost you more than traveling in most countries out there. You can expect to spend around 45 - 65 USD per day per person with food accommodation and transportation. Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling which is leaning more toward the budget side of things. If you want to stick to this budget expect to sleep in dorms eat out only a few times and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation which often times involves walking. Internet in Spain There are several phone carrier you can choose from such as Movistar Orange or Vodafone. I chose Orange and bought a sim card with 3 GB data for 7 EUR which is plenty for 10 days. The coverage is well-covered in all the places I recommended in this itinerary. You can also either top-up at the shops or supermarkets with a label recargas or you can do it yourself online. For more information on Spain sim card Spain Prepaid Data SIM Card. Travel Insurance If you are looking for travel insurance to go along with your trip to Spain I would recommend WorldNomads.com which is what I use to look for a travel insurance that fits my kind of adventure. Get a Quote from World Nomads 10 Days Itinerary for Spain Madrid 2 Nights Madrid is a great place to begin your journey in Spain and get the hang of the different culture and norms they have here more so on their ridiculously late lunch and dinner time 3 PM and 10 PM - 12 AM respectively. One your first day I would recommend you go on a free walking tour around the most famous tourist attractions in Madrid. That way you wouldnt miss anything as you will have only one full day here. Places that are worth seeing which should be included in the free walking tour organized by MADride are the Puerta del Sol square Royal Palace of Madrid and Plaza Mayor. If you want to try something unique you can visit the oldest restaurant in the world Sobrino de Botín which has been operating for more than 250 years. It is expensive but it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you want to explore the nightlife of Madrid MADRide do also organize a pub crawl which will take you to all the cool nightlife venue around the city in one night so you are getting a glimpse of the Madrid nightlife all in one day. Looking for a complete travel guide to Madrid?7 Awesome Things To Do In Madrid Seville 2 Nights From Madrid you can take a direct bus to Seville which should take around 6 - 7 hours. After you arrive settle in your hostel/hotel and go out for a nice evening walk along the river in Triana and have a nice delicious and affordable tapas at Las Golondrinas 2 for dinner. One of the most beautiful architecture in Seville that you must not miss is the Plaza de Espana a gigantic red-brick palace located Maria Luisa Park. Its architecture blew my mind away with all its intricate detail. You can spend hours here just walking around the palace and observe the little stunning detail put into the design of every corner of Plaza de Espana. Oh and this was also a place they shot Star Wars Episode 2 The Attack of the Clones in a sequence where Anakin and Padmé arrive on Naboo. Just a little fun fact about the place 😊. Maria Luisa Park is also a great place to walk around on your way back to the city center after visiting Plaza de Espana as it is nearby. The first thing you see when you arrive in Seville is the massive Gothic-style cathedral the Catedral de Sevilla. It is the third-largest cathedral in the world and a must-visit when you are in Seville. Be sure to also drop by Alcázar of Seville just south of Catedral de Sevilla. Its a royal palace with several collection of stunning architecture worth seeing and you can also stroll around the beautiful park inside the palace. Looking for a complete travel guide to Seville?5 Best Things To Do In Seville Granada 3 Nights Granada is definitely my favorite city out of all Spain. It has a lot of outdoor things to do like hiking trails and viewpoints all the while you can find cheap tapas and beers very easily within the city but best of all its the location of the famous Alhambra Fortress. The Alhambra Fortress is a must-visit when in Granada but one thing to note is that they limit the number of entry each day so be sure to book a ticket and a time slot to Alhambra Fortress in advanced 14 - 17 EUR. You can spend almost an entire day just walking around the fortress exploring all the beautiful gardens and observing all the intricate detail of the architecture of each structure that you wont see anywhere else. Another great thing to do is to go on a free cave walking tour in the afternoon that will take you to the sunset viewpoint up at Sacromonte where you will be able to get a panoramic view of Granada and the surrounding mountain range. The tour will take you to a cave area behind the Sacromonte hill where you will be able to see the locals still using caves as their shelters while the guide explains where they came from and tell a backstory of how it came to be. Highly recommended! The next day I would recommend you go and hike the Waterfall Trail Los Cahorros de Monachil which can be access via a local bus from Granada to Monachil where you can walk along the river to the trailhead and hike through waterfalls and suspension bridges. Its a fun and easy micro adventure you can do from Granada. Looking for a complete travel guide to Granada?7 Incredible Things to Do in Granada Barcelona 3 Nights Last but not least we travel to Catalonia and ended our journey in Spain with a unique touch of Catalonian culture. First and foremost go up the Park Güell hill in the morning to get an unbeatable panoramic view of Barcelona where you can also spot the famous forever-under-construction La Sagrada Familia cathedral where you will be visiting in the evening. On your way down be sure to stop by Gaudís house museum and get that iconic picture of one of Gaudís best works. Gaudís and his weird in a good way! mind can be seen scattered throughout the city such as Casa Milà and the Dragons Scales Roof of Casa Batlló so be sure to walk by there when you are in Barcelona. Another good district to spend your day walking around is the Gothic Quarter landmarked by the Cathedral of Barcelona its beautiful Roman-era buildings and all the antique narrow street you can explore. There is also the oldest restaurant Can Culleretes in Barcelona you can try as well. At the end of the day visit the La Sagrada Familia. Why did I leave this at the end? Because the cathedral is best seen in the evening when the light is best and not too bright. This cathedral I can say is the most beautiful cathedral I have seen so far. The intricate detail of the interior and how it manipulates lights blew my mind away. The entry to witness such astounding man-made structure is worth every single EUR spent to get in. Be sure to book the ticket and time slot in advanced as they limit the number of entry to the cathedral. Photos by Mike McBey The next day I recommend you go on a day trip and visit the Montserrat Monastery a monastery located photogenically at the top of a rocky mountain range only 1.5 hours away from Barcelona by train. You will have to get to Plaça Espanya train station and take the R5 Manresa line to Aeri de Montserrat and from there get a cable car up to the top and spend a few hours walking around the area. You can buy all these tickets including the return ticket in a bundle for 22 EUR each at the Plaça Espanya.

It’s easy to wander into high-end restaurants without realizing it and walk away with the idea that dining out in NYC is wallet-busting. And while it is true that New York is home to a lot of $500 set-menu restaurants and restaurants where a nice” simple” dinner with wine can top $100 the city is also home to starving artists working-class folks and underpaid interns trying to make it in the big city — and they can’t afford any of those fancy meals. Heck not many people can. I mean who can drop $100 on dinner all the time? Not me! Not you! Not the majority of these people! Because of that New York City also has a variety of cheap eats happy hours and food deals that make it easy to eat in NYC on a budget. However as a visitor it’s often hard to know where to find those holes-in-the-wall and markets. This is definitely a place where you need to be in the know for a lot of this deals. There are thousands of restaurants in the city. How do you navigate them all? You need someone on the inside. That person is me! So today I am going to share my tips on how you can eat out in NYC on a budget and give you some of the knowledge I’ve accumulated by always eating out in the city Eating in NYC Tip #1 Hit the Oyster Happy Hours During the week you can find countless oyster happy hours which are one of the most popular things to do especially in the summer when you can sit outside. They start around 4pm and go until 6 or 7pm and the oysters range from $1 to $1.50. Arrive early as most restaurants fill up quickly and build up impossible wait times. My favorite and the best oyster happy hours in NYC are Jeffrey’s Grocery 172 Waverly Place West Village +1 646-398-7630 The Dead Rabbit 30 Water St +1 646-422-7906 Good Night Sonny 134 First Ave +1 646-692-3254 Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar 95 First Ave +1 646-791-5400 The Mermaid Inn 96 Second Ave East Village +1 212-674-5870 John Dory Oyster House 1196 Broadway +1 212-792-9000 Grand Central Oyster Bar lower level Grand Central Terminal 89 East 42nd St +1 212-490-6650 Zadie’s Oyster Room 413 East 12th St Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar Chelsea Market 75 Ninth Ave +1 646-568-1223 The Ten Bells 247 Broome St +1 212-228-4450 <liSagaponack Bar & Grill 4 West 22nd St +1 212-229-2226 Greenpoint Fish &- Lobster Co. 114 Nassau Ave Brooklyn +1 718-349-0400 Brazen Fox 106 Third Ave +1 212-353-1063 Littleneck 288 Third Ave +1 718-522-1921 The Jeffrey 311 East 60th St +1 212-355-2337 Atrium DUMBO 15 Main St +1 718-858-1095 Catfish 1433 Bedford Ave Brooklyn +1 347-305-3233 Eating in NYC Tip #2 Bottomless Brunch New York City runs on the bottomless brunch where for around $35 you get unlimited drinks with your food. This is a weekend-only thing and a staple of the city’s social scene. There are countless bottomless brunches so it would be impossible to include them all here but below are some of the most affordable and best value bunches in the city The Flying Cock 497 Third Ave +1 212-689-6900 – Pay $19 for bottomless Bloody Marys mimosas or Bellinis for 90 minutes. Poco NYC 33 Avenue B at Third St +1 212-228-4461 – Pay $35 for an entrée and 1.5 hours of bottomless mimosas sangria or Bloody Marys. Cash only.

Eating in NYC Tip #3 Grab a Pizza Slice NYC and pizza go together like white on rice. You can’t separate the two and in my opinion the New York slice is probably one of the best pizzas in the country sorry Chicago! If you’re looking to eat on a budget grabbing a slice is one of the best ways to save money in New York. Slices range from $1 to $4 though $2 is the max I’ll pay unless it’s really good. Below is a list of my favorite dollar-slice joints and a couple non-dollar slices just because they are that good Percy’s Pizza 190 Bleecker St Joe’s Pizza 150 East 14th St and other locations 2 Bros 601 Sixth Ave Ivana’s Pizzeria 2373 Arthur Ave Bronx +1 718-365-4322 99 Cents Fresh Pizza 151 East 43rd St 473 Lexington Ave 201 East 34th St B 9th Ave the Best Pizza 748 Ninth Ave NY Fresh Pizza 787 Ninth Ave Joey Pepperoni’s Pizza 381 Broadway 493 Second Ave 114 East Fordham Rd Bronx One Dollar Pizza 578 Ninth Ave +1 212-967-3310 Vinny Vincenz Pizza 231 1st Ave 212-674-0707 Eating in NYC Tip #4 Munch on Dumplings Chinese dumplings are also one of the best value meals in the city because you can get huge plates of dumplings for literally just a few dollars and if you get them frozen for later they are even cheaper. They’ll fill you up for lunch and you’ll still have leftovers for dinner. And thanks to the city’s large Chinese immigrant population the dumplings are incredibly authentic. This is the real deal here. Here’s a list of the best spots to get dumplings in NYC Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle 40 Bowery St +1 646-683-0939 – 9-11 dumplings for $3. Vanessa’s Dumpling House 220 East 14th St Union Square +1 212-529-1328 – 5-10 for just $2 or less. Noodle Q 2 East Broadway +1 212-219-8223 – A big plate for $6.

Eating in NYC Tip #5 Grab a Dog Hot dog shops litter the street corners of New York. They might not be the healthiest meal but they are super cheap and make for a quick lunch. Though the hot dog has been around for centuries the modern dog was popularized by Nathan Handwerker a Jewish immigrant from Poland living in NYC. In 1915 he worked at a hot dog stand at Coney Island. He started his own stand Nathan’s Famous and undercut his former boss to sell his own dogs and the rest is hot dog history. You can get a big juicy dog with lots of fixings for between $2 and $5. Here are the best hot dog shops in New York City Gray’s Papaya 2090 Broadway visit the website for more locations Crif Dogs 113 St Mark’s Pl +1 212-614-2728 Rudy’s 627 9th Ave +1 646-707-0890 – This dive bar gives you a free hot dog when you order a drink. Nathan’s Famous visit the website for locations Feltman’s Kitchen 80 St Mark’s Pl visit the website for other locations Dickson’s Farmstand Meats Chelsea Market +1 212-242-2630 Papaya King 179 East 86th St +1 212-369-0648 Tony Dragon’s Grill Madison Ave & East 62nd St +1 917-299-1550 Paul’s Da Burger Joint 131 2nd Ave +1 212-529-3033 Dominick’s Hot Dog Truck Woodhaven Blvd & 67th Ave Deli & Dogz food truck visit the website for locations Harlem Shake 100 West 124th St Shake Shack visit the website for locations Eating in NYC Tip #6 Food Trucks If you’re looking for cheap eats check out the food trucks around town that are a staple for the office workers. You’ll find shawarma hot dogs gyros halal items and lots more grab-and-go food. They tend to be located near big parks like Central Park or Union Square Midtown or the big squares in the financial district. Their cheap quick eats are what we have for breakfast and lunch though many are around during the evening too. Most meals costs $5-7 USD. Eating in NYC Tip #7 Make Your Own Food Sure New York City has tons of delicious and expensive restaurants but go to the supermarket grab either a premade meal or ingredients to make your own and head to one of the parks and eat outside. Or back to your Airbnb to make your meal. Most supermarkets also have areas where you can eat inside too. My favorite grocery stores in the city are Whole Foods – Whole Foods has affordable natural and organic foods primarily from local vendors. Trader Joe’s – A grocery store chain with super low prices all the time. Food Emporium – Another supermarket chain that also has lots of imported food options. Eating in NYC Tip #8 Try Meal Pal for the extended traveler If you’re looking to be in town for a while two weeks or more consider signing up for the service MealPal. It’s $120 USD for a month $6 a meal which works out to be a super cheap way to eat. Monday through Friday at lunch you get to choose a preset meal from thousands of restaurants. Think of it like a lunch menu at your fingertips. MealPal also has a dinner option and packages as small as 8 meals per month so even if you’re planning a 2 week trip you could make this work any package you choose will make your lunches or dinners only $6-8 each. It’s a good way to try new restaurants as well as eat cheap. Eating in NYC Tip #9 Eat Outside Manhattan I love Manhattan. It’s my favorite borough in the city but whenever I leave it I’m always reminded of how expensive it is. The other boroughs are like half the price of Manhattan. In Queens for example you’ll find a ton of great and cheap ethnic food. Eating in NYC Tip #10 Use the Apps Looking for cheap eats? Crowdsource. Use apps to search for people’s favorite restaurants or what is affordable near you. My suggested apps are Yelp – Yelp lets you find places to eat and drink in your area and there are usually tons of reviews left by patrons. Foursquare – Find out where the locals are eating and unlock special deals when you check into a place. OpenTable – Check local restaurant reviews and then reserve your table. Roaming Hunger – Find out which food trucks are in your area! Eating in NYC Tip #11 Eat Bagels The NYC bagel is as famous as the NYC slice. We take our bagels seriously here Just ask all the ex-NYers living in LA if they can find a good bagel there! They’ll say no and lament that’s one thing they miss the most. Most bagels will cost $3-4 with cream cheese more if you want lox which you should. A bagel sandwich will cost around $5-6. Here’s a list of my favorite bagel spots Ess-a-Bagel 831 Third Ave +1 212-980-1010 Murray’s Bagels 500 Avenue of the Americas +1 212-462-2830 Lenny’s Bagels 2601 Broadway +1 212-222-0410 Bagelsmith 189 Bedford Ave Brooklyn +1 718-218-7414 visit the website for more locations Russ & Daughters 127 Orchard St Lower East Side +1 212 475 4880 Baz Bagel 181 Grand St +1 212-335-0609 Absolute Bagel 2788 Broadway +1 212-932-2105 Best Bagel & Coffee 225 West 35th St A +1 212-564-4409 Kossar’s 367 Grand St +1 212-473-4810 Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company 286 Eighth Ave +1 718-204-0141 Black Seed 170 Elizabeth St +1 212-730-1950 visit the website for more locations Tompkins Square Bagels 165 Avenue A +1 646-351-6520 David’s Bagels 273 First Ave +1 212-780-2308 Zucker’s Bagels 370 Lexington Ave +1 212-608-5844 Bagel Supreme 9401 Fifth Ave +1 718-745-1108 Bo’s Bagels 235 West 116th St 917-902-8345 Daniel’s Bagels 569 Third Ave Eating in NYC Tip #12 Do Restaurant Week If you’re here during July or October the exact dates change each year New York City’s Restaurant Week has some amazing deals as over 380 of New York’s best restaurants offer $26 lunch menus and $42 three-course dinners. This gives you a chance to sample the best restaurants in town at a fraction of the regular price. Visit the official page for all the details and to book your table.

I’m already signed up. Would like a way to opt out so that I can read the article easily. Reply Keith November 8 2018 at 421 am My tip is to buy a sandwich at almost any deli bodega or corner store. They’re typically massive cost around $5 and when cut in half will give you 2 filling servings. Much better than a chain store sandwich. As a tourist in NYC grabbing one is the first order of business before heading out for a day of exploration. Carrying one in your backpack will prevent the need for dining in an expensive lunch joint when you get hungry in the afternoon. Reply Ali Raza February 11 2019 at 904 pm Matt that was really helpful post. You have made it so simple to come to newyork. thanks.

With a low cost of living incredible food rich culture plenty of partying and a mai pen rai no worries attitude the Land of Smiles is a very popular country for English teachers. For Thais English is considered a necessity to work in the global market so there is always a need for teachers. With language schools primary schools universities and other locations offering English classes there are numerous avenues for employment. So how do you get a job teaching English in Thailand? In order to do so you need to be a native speaker from an English-speaking country defined as the US Canada the UK Ireland Australia and New Zealand or prove your fluency and have a bachelor’s degree. Because of the popularity of teaching English in Thailand I’d recommend also having a 120-hour TEFL TESOL or CELTA certificate to make you more competitive. With all teaching opportunities in Thailand salaries vary greatly depending on the location and employer. In hot tourist destinations like Koh Samui Phuket and other spots expect to earn less than what you would make in less exotic locales because people will accept a lower salary in exchange for the beach lifestyle. You will earn the most in Bangkok followed by Chiang Mai. Here’s a breakdown of the various ways to teach in the country and what to expect with each position Public Schools Public schools are free from preschool through high school. The school year begins in May and ends in March and includes a three-week break in October. As a public school teacher in Thailand expect to work full-time even if you’re not teaching every moment of the day. Responsibilities range from creating lesson plans and exams to grading papers none of which you are compensated for if it’s on your own time as well as keeping office hours at school. Students range in their knowledge and understanding of English and often there is little guidance in terms of the curriculum you need to create. You’re basically on your own here! Many teachers incorporate games television shows and movies into their classes. In public schools the student-to-teacher ratio is high so expect large class sizes. Salaries range from 25000 to 40000 THB $827–1317 USD a month. Teaching in the cities will earn you the most money. You can expect lower salaries in the countryside but cost of living is so cheap there you’ll still end up having plenty of extra money! Private and International Schools There are very few differences between public schools and private and international schools other than the lower student-to-teacher ratio and the fact that salaries are significantly higher since they are not free to attend. International schools have the most coveted positions but you’ll need to be an actual certified teacher to get one of them as the curriculum follows the West’s. Private schools are a little less strict but you’ll still want to have some experience. You’ll need to have not only a degree but also a TEFL TESOL or CELTA certificate and prior teaching experience and be a native English speaker. If you’ve never taught English before or have only a little experience you’re unlikely to get a job at one of these schools. Whereas the public schools follow the Thai system and come with little support these institutions tend to be more like Western schools so if you’re wondering what teaching is like there just think back to what it was like when you went to school! International schools pay the most roughly 80000–170000 THB $2633–5596 USD a month which is well above the typical Thai salary and allows for your lifestyle to be more lavish private schools pay 60000–80000 THB $1975–2633 USD. These positions also come with a lot of perks contract bonuses lots of vacation days health insurance and sometimes airfare to and from Thailand. Universities Teaching at a university in Thailand can help give you an edge over the competition for other English teaching jobs in the country. But teaching at a university means teaching part-time and earning only 30000–60000 THB $987–1975 USD a month. The upside is that you can also teach at another school part-time you get a few months of paid vacation and you are compensated generously should you have to work overtime about 1000–1500 THB or $33–49 USD an hour. Depending on where you teach your responsibilities will be different. All teachers must come up with lesson plans but some may also have to teach faculty or have additional sessions outside of the classroom among other duties. You may or may not have textbooks to use for your curriculum. Class sizes at universities are notoriously large about 50 students. Language Schools Teaching English at a language school in Thailand is different than at a public or private school. Classes are normally held in the morning before the workday starts to accommodate businesspeople then again in the afternoon and into the evening for children and adults. The workweek at language schools extends into the weekend. At language schools classes are small and range from four to ten students. As a teacher it’s your responsibility to come up with lesson plans and activities. There’s also the option at language schools to work full- or part-time. Full-time teachers make anywhere from 30000 to 40000 THB $987-1316 USD per month part-time teachers make 350–500 THB $11.50–16.50 UD per hour. There are lots and lots of language schools in the country and jobs are fairly easy to get. They don’t really care about previous experience or even if you have a TEFL certificate though having both makes it easier to get a job. You’ll also get very little support from the schools and will basically have to set up everything on your own. You’ll only get paid for actual classroom time. I didn’t really love teaching at the language schools but the work was easy even if it was not well paid. Corporate Training Programs As a corporate teacher you teach from a company’s office giving lessons to their staff. Classes tend to be large so many employees can attend. Because these programs are quite expensive the positions are only filled by teachers with experience. Expect to work during the morning or late at night as you have to teach people outside business hours. Corporate teachers make anywhere from 45000 to 60000 THB $1481–1974 USD a month and it’s normal for the school to cover travel expenses to the company. Test Preparation Test preparation in Thailand is different than in other English positions. You must be knowledgeable in a variety of English tests including SAT or GRE prep and have finished in the 95th percentile or above as well as IELTS and TOEIC both of which are used to test students before they work or study abroad. As a test prep teacher classes are either groups or private and take place on both weekdays and weekends. It’s your job to not only teach the courses but also design and develop the course curriculum. Test prep teachers average about 600 THB $20 USD an hour. Best Job Resources for Teaching in Thailand There are numerous sites to find jobs teaching English in Thailand. The best one for jobs is ajarn.com as it simply has the most listings and is specific to Thailand. It’s the oldest teaching in Thailand website too. Other sites with job postings include the following Go Overseas Teach Away Teaching in Thailand How to Apply for a Visa It isn’t hard to apply for the Non-Immigrant B visa necessary to teach English in Thailand and your school will help you do but there are quite a few steps to getting it and then starting teaching. First make sure your passport has validity beyond six months and have passport photos for applications as well as your original bachelor’s degree transcripts and a certified criminal background check. Next you’ll need to apply for a visa from outside of Thailand and include a letter from your employer with the job offer. Once you have your visa your employer steps in and handles the paperwork completing the remainder of the application on your behalf. After the visa is complete you’ll need to have a physical exam and a medical certificate from a Thai doctor and then get your work permit. From there it’s on to the Immigration Department in order to extend your visa in your passport for 12 months. The last two steps are to get your tax card from the Tax Department and then your teaching license. Your employer should be able to assist you in all aspects of the process. It’s important to note that if you choose to teach without these necessary items you run the risk of getting kicked out of the country and fined. *** Teaching English in Thailand is one of the best teaching opportunities in the world thanks to the country’s cost of living tropical environment and laid-back lifestyle. With so many options for teaching and the ease of getting a visa it’s a perfect spot to start your English teaching career abroad. Ready to Teach Overseas?
