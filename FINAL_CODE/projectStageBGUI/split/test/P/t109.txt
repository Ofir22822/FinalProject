 inspired by RPGs like Final Fantasy. Game testers liked it so much, it became a part of the series. An Easter egg in the Caustic Caverns level unlocks a Minecraft head for players who find its off-map location and defeat a giant Creeper. Almost everyone on the creative team for Borderlands 2 has since left Gearbox.
Released 2017 98 Casey DeFreitas When I was famished for Dungeons and Dragons, Divinity: Original Sin 2 filled that void for me. It gave me the freedom to cheat, steal, kill, or persuade my way with kindness through the campaign with a friend (or three!) just like in D&D. Creative play is not only allowed, but encouraged and intentionally made possible by the developers. It felt liberating playing a huge RPG that rewards “cheating” the system, and encountering NPCs and opponents that acknowledge and react to it. I’ve since recommended it to all of my real-life D&D parties, and they’ve all come back with the same opinion: This is the best D&D experience you can get from a video game. DOS2 even has a Game Master mode, which lets you build your own campaigns. But, the built-in story is decidedly plenty and nearly infinitely replayable. The premade characters all have their own special storylines, and the numerous way things pan out depend on player actions, backstory choices, race, and more. Whether playing on an easy or hard difficulty setting, as an Elf Ranger or an Undead Conjurer, as a helpful adventurer or a murderous thief, DOS2 is a fun fantasy world to get lost in no matter what.

Funds for the game were procured through Kickstarter, the campaign for which was fully funded (and then some) in less than 12 hours. Developer Larian Studios won over Wizards of the Coast (and thus the rights to make Baldur's Gate 3) with Divinity OS 2.
Released 2012 97 Brendan Graeber Dishonored managed to breathe new life into a faltering stealth genre by invigorating players with a host of magical abilities and wickedly clever tools for every occasion. By allowing you to get creative with stealth (or a total lack thereof), players could slip through levels like a ghostly wraith, or slice up unsuspecting foes as a murderous spirit of vengeance. Dishonored revitalized the stealth genre with its approach to rewarding each playstyle: whether challenging yourself to remain unseen and getting your revenge without ever spilling blood, or springing deadly traps and disposing of targets in the most gruesome way possible. Its levels are impeccably designed to reward careful exploration and planning, and provide multiple ways to complete objectives with secrets crammed in every corner. Did You Know? Though he never spoke in Dishonored, protagonist Corvo Attano was voiced by Stephen Russell in Dishonored 2, who played another iconic stealth protagonist: Garrett from the Thief series. Each of the main targets in Dishonored can be eliminated by nonlethal means -
