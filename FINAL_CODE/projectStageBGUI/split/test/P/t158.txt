 skate video shoot. When Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 came out, and improved upon the original in virtually every single way imaginable (even more flexible controls, an expanded soundtrack, more unlockable secrets, custom skaters, even a park editor!), the popularity of the game just exploded in a way that could only have ended in steadily diminishing annual releases. But for one shining moment, we all collectively agreed that THPS2 was, and still is, the perfect skateboarding game. Did You Know? THPS2 was built on a modified version of the engine Neversoft used to create the video game tie-in for the Bruce Willis movie, 'Apocalypse' — the pitch demo for the orignal game featured Bruce Willis' character model on a skateboard. Neversoft also developed the 2000 Spider-Man game on Playstation, so naturally the webslinger showed up in THPS2 as a friendly neighborhood skater complete with his own unique Spidey-moves! The original PS version of THPS2 featured an unlockable character, Private Carrera, based on the adult film star Asia Carerra. In the Dreamcast and Xbox ports, this character was replaced by the less salacious (and presumably more family-friendly) "Trixie".
Casey DeFreitas Kill a monster, make gear out of its parts, and hunt a stronger monster sounds like a gameplay loop that can get old fast, but Monster Hunter: World has taken that decade-old hook and downright perfected it. World has streamlined the cycle and made the introduction into monster hunting more palatable for newcomers all without watering down the deep action-RPG mechanics longtime fans loved most. With 14 unique weapons that all control entirely differently, endless armor customization options that change more than just fashion, and incredibly difficult (but fair) fights that reward players with an incomparable sense of accomplishment, Monster Hunter: World is in a world of its own when it comes to endless replayability and challenge. Add in the fact you can hunt with your best friends, and you have a recipe worthy of the Meowscular Chef himself.
Released 2019 81 Lucy O'Brien Resident Evil 2 Remake redefined what a ‘remake’ could be. For players new to the game, this was a meticulously crafted survival horror experience that felt completely in step with the genre in 2019, while veterans got to enjoy a lovingly crafted piece of nostalgia that vitally, felt like the game they remembered from 1998. It trod a brilliant tightrope, capturing the inherent weirdness of the original - the baroque architecture and labyrinthian environments that flipped the bird to logic - while updating the control scheme to a fluid over-the-shoulder camera far more suited to the way we play games today. The result was uneasy but never frustrating, subversive but familiar. All remakes should learn from this one. Did You Know? Capcom wanted to initially remake Resident Evil 2 in 2002, but series creator Shinji Mikami wanted to keep everyone focused on development of Resident Evil 4. There were no bathrooms in the original Resident Evil 2 police station; they were added in the remake. Mods had a lot
