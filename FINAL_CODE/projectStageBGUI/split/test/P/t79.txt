 code prompts that live in the memory space right next door. This unique simulation game made day to day life exciting. We could concoct drama and design our own stories, complete with the tools to build dream living spaces. The Sims gave us an incredible playground to be creators and destroyers, and though The Sims' newer iterations make Sims far more complex, the original stands as a classic. Plus, it allowed us to drown our Sims in pools, which is, as we all know, an essential Sims experience. The new Sims are too smart for that. Did You Know? Will Wright was inspired to make The Sims after his house burned down in a fire and he was forced to rebuild his life from the ground up. Wright also meant The Sims to satirize American consumerism. Simlish, the language spoken in the series, was invented to avoid repetitive dialogue and avoid the cost of translation.
Released 2007 63 Ryan McCaffrey I'd heard about Guitar Hero, but I only had an Xbox and Xbox 360. So when Guitar Hero II hit, I fell for the plastic-guitar genre hard.

Rock Band featured an achievement for playing through every song in the game in a row without stopping. The original plastic instruments were wired. Rock Band 2 introduced wireless guitars and drums. Harmonix also shipped another game in 2007: the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II.
Released 2018 62 Luke Reilly A sprawling Western that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of gaming’s greatest open-world achievements, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare scope and even rarer quality. A beautiful ode to an ugly era, RDR2 combines Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever with its most earnest storytelling to date, filling in the gaps with an astonishing array of deep systems and nearly endless emergent gameplay opportunities. Its slower pace allows us to binge on the world like a virtual
