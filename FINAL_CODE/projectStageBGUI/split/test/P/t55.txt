 of lateral thinking, but thankfully you've usually got a lot of nifty tricks up your sleeve, turning you into more of a trickster god than an assassin. Tom: I worried that the move to Karnaca would hurt the game, as Dunwall was so evocative in game one. I needn't have. Though the game takes place in the sunshine of a coastal southern town, it's rife with corruption and swarming with horrible plague flies. I love everything I look at in this game, whether it's a cool desk lamp, or a shutte suspended on rails above the city. Emily is a great addition as well. Abilities like Domino—which pairs enemies together so if you kick one they all get kicked—are genius. 6. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Released 2019 | Last position 3 (Image credit: From Software) Harry: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice isn't just one of the finest, tightest, sharpest action games, it's also one of the best rhythm games you can play on PC right now. Imagining each flourish of an enemy sword as a node on an approaching fretboard is a useful way of parrying and dodging your way through the immaculately dark world of Sengoku-era Japan. As is customary from FromSoftware by now, the combat is note-perfect, too, making the punishingly rewarding learning curve feel as firm, and fair, as ever. Tom: FromSoftware can do no wrong at the moment. Sekiro features the best combat system the developer has made yet. The block-and-parry system produces fights that look as though they have been choreographed, and there are some outstanding bosses. Wes: I've only become obsessed with Sekiro in mid-2020, but damn, what a game. It retains just enough of the Souls flavor and intricate level design while being a much more focused action game. It's the proper Ninja Gaiden sequel I've wanted for more than a decade.
5. Slay the Spire Released 2019 | Last position 4 (Image credit: Mega Crit Games) Tyler: Still the best roguelike deckbuilder, despite a couple of challengers. You'll know you're hooked after the first time you spend a full minute deciding whether to click on a campfire or a shop. Robin: In the years since its Early Access release, I don’t think there’s any game I’ve played as much as Slay the Spire. The decks you build as you play feel like intricate engines—and there’s always some new configuration of parts to try. Wes: Shout out to Electrodynamics, the card that turns my beloved android Defect into a lightning bolt-casting murder machine. It always makes me feel unstoppable, right up until the wrong boss fight ruins my night. But there's always time for another run… Evan: I've got 160 hours in Slay, but in the past month I've switched allegiances entirely to Monster Train, a roguelike deckbuilder that cribs a lot of Slay's template but draws way more inspiration from Magic: The Gathering with its emphasis on creature summoning and color combinations. Bonus: you fill a train with a bunch of demons so you
