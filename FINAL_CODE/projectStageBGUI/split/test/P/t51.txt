 suspended over a hellmouth, well, here you go. Harry: Doom Eternal's frantic relentlessness is exactly what I'm looking for in a shooter. Juggling resources and living every second on the edge of death is a great way to unwind and few other games require quite the same undivided, hysterical concentration. While Eternal didn't change enough to give it the impact the 2016 reboot did, it didn't really need to. That intoxicating cocktail of hardcore metal, intricate map design, and gruesomely cathartic glory kills is as exhilirating as ever, in necessarily short bursts. James: Doom 2016 is still great! Go play that if you want to breathe between headshots, if you want to remain fully conscious and aware while ripping up demons and sticking it to the man (the man is hell). But Doom Eternal is a vastly different experience. Doom 2016 wants you to feel cool and sweat a bit. Doom Eternal kept me in a lizard-brained panic, balanced precariously between frenzy and despair, an FPS automaton of pure instinct for 15 damn hours. It's a painful, cleansing experience. Doom Eternal aged me. 13. Kentucky Route Zero Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: cardboard computer) Rachel: Cardboard Computer took seven years to release all five episodes of Kentucky Route Zero, and yet it was worth the wait. This evocative adventure about the struggles of rural America are more relevant today than ever. Kentucky Route Zero is an anthology of stories from the road, tales of lore and mythos intertwined with the tough truths of working class folk. Miners, electricians and store clerks take centre stage telling stories of survival during economic hardship. The magical-realism enhances these tales and, as dreamlike as it can be, Kentucky Route Zero stays firmly grounded in respect for its characters. It's a powerful story that conjures a damning portrait of America and those who are forced to wander its lost highways. 12. XCOM 2 Released 2016 | Last position 13 (Image credit: 2K) Wes: XCOM 2 sticks around year after year because it's such an endlessly flexible sandbox, but the Chosen, stars of its must-have expansion, really make it for me. They're nasty, vengeful alien commandos who show up to make your life hell time and again. They made me miserable, but in return I tracked them to their hideouts and relished the chance to finish them off after so much torment. Evil's just more fun to fight when it has a face you can punch. Robin: I reviewed XCOM 2 back when it came out, and honestly I’ve never really stopped playing it. All its different layers of randomness—especially with the expansion and some choice mods—just make it endlessly replayable for me. It’s this big, intricate, shifting puzzle that I never get tired of unpicking. 11. Planescape: Torment Released 1999 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Beamdog) Jody: I first played Dungeons & Dragons in the 1990s, before it got cool or had rules that were good. Even then Planescape
