 the original Resident Evil 2 police station; they were added in the remake. Mods had a lot of fun turning the relentless Mr X into various other characters, including (but not limited to), Thomas the Tank Engine and Pennywise the Dancing Clown.
Released 1999 80 Ryan McCaffrey Say the word "SHODAN" to any veteran PC gamer and they're likely to do a full-body shudder followed immediately by cracking a big smile. System Shock 2 paved the way for the genre-blending first-person games that are commonplace today, perfecting the formula years before anyone else would even try. Its premise was straightforward: you found yourself alone on a space station where you were apparently the only thing left alive. Well, the only organic thing. Rogue AI SHODAN wastes little time in establishing herself as your formidable opponent. Along the way you pick up elements of the backstory through audio logs (another design feature that's standard fare now) and can mold yourself in any way you choose, from a DPS/combat focus to a pure hacker that can infiltrate any system. System Shock 2 was tense, smart, and as great as it was immediately upon its release in 1999, ahead of its time. Did You Know? System Shock 2 did not initially enter production as a System Shock sequel until Electronic Arts signed on as publisher. Audio logs from a character named Norris were voiced by a System Shock fan who won the "Get Killed By SHODAN" contest out of 4,500 entrants. One of the keypad codes, 45100, is a reference to Fahrenheit 451.
Released 2002 79 Brandin Tyrrel As the second 3D game in the now mega-series Grand Theft Auto, Vice City had enormous shoes to fill coming off the groundbreaking statement that was Grand Theft Auto III. And did it ever deliver. Set during the 1980s in Rockstar’s facsimile of Miami, the violence, sex, and excess of this defining decade was slathered across a fully playable world of wannabe gangsters, sports cars, mountains of drugs, and briefcases full of bills. Mining veins of content from Scarface, Miami Vice, and other seminal pop culture pillars of the era, Vice City had it all: a cast of larger-than-life characters and a rags-to-riches protagonist who builds his empire on the blood, sweat, and more blood of the sun-soaked, drug-addled, sex-crazed slice of beach city. And it's that ‘80s personality that propped up Vice City any time its open-world gameplay started to falter – much of that personality coming from the incredible soundtrack that is alone worth the price of admission. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a sexy, sour, excellent sendup of the decade that will never die. Did You Know? Vice City survived two lawsuits lead by anti-video game activist Jack Thompson, who claimed it was linked to real crimes. That famously '80s soundtrack has resulted in a few licensing issues over the years, seeing certain songs cut from different versions. Its script was over 1,000 pages long and over 8,000 lines of dialogue were recorded
