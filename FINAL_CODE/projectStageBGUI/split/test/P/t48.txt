 a computer strapped to me face, and usually 30 minutes is as much as I can stand before I want to take off my headset for a break. I found Alyx so comfortable in VR that I had several sessions that lasted over two hours long, something I've never done in a VR game before. At no point did I feel like I needed a break or a breath. Whatever it does under the hood is incredibly impressive. And that's excellent because it's also incredibly engrossing. I was skeptical a game sandwiched between Half-Life 1 and 2 could do much story-wise, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. Half-Life: Alyx completely invigorated a storyline I've been invested in for over 20 years with some genuinely thrilling revelations. Emma: I suffer from motion sickness and I'm so grateful for the effort that Valve put in to make Alyx feel as comfortable as possible. As Chris mentions, it's so easy to sink a few hours into it without realising how long you've been playing. The story is incredible, and I'm excited to jump in for a second playthrough when the weather gets a little colder here in the UK—playing VR in this heat is horrible! 19. Into the Breach Released 2018 | Last position 6 (Image credit: Subset Games) Jody: Not even XCOM: Chimera Squad's missions are perfectly bite-sized like Into the Breach's snacky levels. Strategy games are usually life-devouring posture-killers. Not Into the Breach. Move mechs, trick giant insects into smacking into mountains, and you're done. One step closer to saving a world, time left to walk the dog. Evan: Snacky, as you say, but surprisingly grim! Ben Prunty's music and the tiny word bubbles emerging from the fragile buildings you're charged to protect convey a mood much bleaker than their bits. Mechanically and narratively Into the Breach is a textbook example of what can be achieved with a less-is-more approach. Phil: The way I play Into the Breach, it's almost like Sudoku for someone with a Steam account. I'll spend long minutes pondering a turn, staring at the screen while the real work plays out in my head. "If I move him there, I could… no, wait, because then… ah, but if…" It's a tactics game that tells you all of the terrible things that are about to happen, and lets you take the time to work out how to prevent them all. 18. The Sims 4 Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Electronic Arts) Chris: It'll cost an arm and a leg to keep up with all the expensive add-ons, but there's simply no other game quite like The Sims series. Whether you play casually or devotedly, it remains an utterly absorbing, occasionally morbid, often hilarious dollhouse, person simulator, and story generator. Katie Wickens: I know The Sims was originally designed as a middle-finger to consumerist culture and has now contorted into the very thing it despised, but I can't help getting sucked into the intricate
