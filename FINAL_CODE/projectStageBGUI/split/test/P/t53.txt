 was a wildly imaginative setting—a multiversal city run by squabbling philosophy gangs. Torment takes that setting and emphasises its urban grottiness, with magic tattoos instead of platemail and charms made of flies. The heroes are scuffed-up too. There's a thief who is part-demon and voiced by Sheena Easton, a pyromancer who is punished for lighting fires with eternally burning skin, and you, an amnesiac corpseman who wakes up in a morgue. D&D can be fun when it's elves and dwarves, but it's even better when you're a man who drinks embalming fluid instead of healing potions.
