Released 2017 05 Brian Altano The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild eschewed the semi-linear, borderline predictable path of the 3D Zelda games before it in favor of a bold, crazy new approach: let players do what they want, how they want, and in whatever order they decide. By marrying an open-ended approach to quest structure with the ability to freely explore a vast, beautiful, intriguing world with little specific regulation, the 3D Zelda game template was shattered about as fast as the average breakable weapon in Breath of the Wild.

There are 900 Korok Seeds hidden across Breath of the Wild's massive map and finding them all will reward players with one of the weirdest prizes in the history of Zelda games - a useless, golden statue shaped like a turd. Speedrunners have taken a huge liking to Breath of the Wild due it its freeform quest layout, allowing skilled players to bypass most of the game's content and take on the final boss fight very early on. Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild's launch bridged Nintendo console generations by getting released at the very tail end of the Nintendo Wii U as well as the launch day of the Nintendo Switch.
