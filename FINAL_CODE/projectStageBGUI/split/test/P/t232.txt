 for the first time. It came out in the US almost a year and a half after Japan.
Released 2017 05 Brian Altano The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild eschewed the semi-linear, borderline predictable path of the 3D Zelda games before it in favor of a bold, crazy new approach: let players do what they want, how they want, and in whatever order they decide. By marrying an open-ended approach to quest structure with the ability to freely explore a vast, beautiful, intriguing world with little specific regulation, the 3D Zelda game template was shattered about as fast as the average breakable weapon in Breath of the Wild. The result is a gorgeous, freeing open-world action/adventure experience that evokes the wonder and fear of exploring a bold new place with the empowering tangibility of becoming its hero. Did You Know? There are 900 Korok Seeds hidden across Breath of the Wild's massive map and finding them all will reward players with one of the weirdest prizes in the history of Zelda games - a useless, golden statue shaped like a turd. Speedrunners have taken a huge liking to Breath of the Wild due it its freeform quest layout, allowing skilled players to bypass most of the game's content and take on the final boss fight very early on. Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild's launch bridged Nintendo console generations by getting released at the very tail end of the Nintendo Wii U as well as the launch day of the Nintendo Switch.
Tom Marks Portal undoubtedly came out of nowhere and shattered the mold, but Portal 2 took that raw and incredible concept and managed to shape it into a more polished and impressive package. It cranked the dials up on just about everything that made the original so special. The mind-bending puzzles, the surprisingly dark story, and the ridiculous humor that balanced it out - each piece of that picture was refined and refreshed to build a sequel that actually surpassed the ambition of an already extremely ambitious game, making something both familiar and altogether new. It gave us a deeper look into the wonderful world of Aperture Science without completely dragging all of its mysteries out into the light. It also mixed its “thinking with portals” puzzles up even further by weaving in gel mechanics that felt entirely fresh and completely natural at the same time - while simultaneously and subtly using them to tie gameplay mechanics into the story, patiently waiting until its incredible finale to pay off those setups with one of the weirdest and most spectacular video game endings around. Couple that with a seriously good co-op campaign and even a full-on custom level builder and sharing systems added post-launch and Portal 2 has stayed the high bar by which all first-person puzzle games should be measured, even nearly a decade later.
