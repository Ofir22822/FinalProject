 amazing thanks to the musical contributions of Harry Gregson Williams and a stellar voice cast including Cam Clarke, Jennifer Hale, and *OF COURSE* David Hayter. Metal Gear Solid looked like a movie, sounded like a movie, and felt like a movie, but still played like a video game, striking a delicate balance that the medium is still striving for over twenty years later.
Released 2018 29 Jonathon Dornbush God of War didn't just pull off the impressive feat of reinvigorating and reinventing a franchise that had seemingly run cold, but it also smartly subverted what came before to create an adventure that both played to its past and stood on its own as one of the finest games of its generation. Nearly every facet of Sony Santa Monica's Norse epic is working in concert with one another to craft a thrilling, memorable, and engrossing adventure. From its haunting score, to the beautifully written and acted story of Kratos and Atreus, to the incredible feel of the Leviathan Axe, God of War's impressive craftsmanship shines through at every step, honoring the past while forging its own path. Did You Know? God of War continues the series' trend of making reference to the Boat Captain from the first game, offering an allusion to him in one of the game's treasure maps. God of War received its own feature-length making-of documentary, Raising Kratos, which chronicled the ups and downs of Kratos' reimagining. As of May of 2019, God of War has passed 10 million copies sold.
Released 2015 28 Joe Skrebels For all its inter-dimensional threats, monster hunts and magic powers, I’ve always thought The Witcher 3’s key achievement is in how it nails the mundane.

That sense of reality is what helps you empathise with Geralt, understand the world, and really understand how bad things have gotten when the crazy shit starts popping off. An RPG with enough complexity to satisfy the urge to tinker, but enough character never to feel impersonal, Wild Hunt is a staggering achievement no matter how you look at it. Its story deftly balances cosmic threat and family drama, its choices feel truly meaningful and world-changingly effective, and it looks gorgeous in its own grubby way. Even its two DLC expansions are among the best ever released. Geralt’s final journey might be built on the mundane, but that makes it nothing short of magical. Did You Know? Doug Cockle, the English voice of Geralt, bought a console to play The Witcher 3 – the first Witcher game he decided to play. Developers at CD Projekt Red cited Dark Souls as a major influence on The Witcher 3's combat system. Dynamic beard growth causes Geralt's facial hair to grow over time.
