 making a lot of time to renovate big (and often boring-but-important) systems and old maps, demonstrated again very recently. 24. Persona 4 Golden Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Atlus) Robin: This iconic JRPG boasts all the usual tropes: dungeon crawls, turn-based battles, attacking and dethroning God, etc, but it’s in the mundane, not the supernatural, that it really grabs you. It’s got a wonderful sense of place, its Japanese countryside town utterly evocative and authentic as you progress through the seasons. What really sticks with you is its lovable cast of characters, a tight-knit crew of goofballs and misfits that form one of the most convincing and endearing friendship groups in games. Wes: Years before it was on PC I spent a good month playing Persona 4 in bed nearly every day, getting to know its great group of characters. The fanbase may overhype how truly interesting they all are, but the slow burn nature of Persona 4 lets you really live with them, and get to know them to a degree that few games can match, as you spend days just hanging out by the river talking, going shopping, or eating beef bowls. So many beef bowls. All the rest of the JRPG stuff is fun too, but really, Persona 4 is just a great teenage friendship simulator. 23. Return of the Obra Dinn Released 2018 | Last position 8 (Image credit: 3909) Wes: There's no better feeling than noticing some tiny detail—could that really be a clue?—and being rewarded by Obra Dinn's enthusiastic burst of music when properly guessing how one of these sailors met their grisly end. Just pay attention to everyone's shirt, is all I'm saying. Rachel: Lucas Pope's haunting detective game makes you witness things that have only existed in the gossip of sailors. Its bleached 1-bit visuals invite players to look a little closer before a chilling realisation sinks in. It's one of the best mysteries on PC, and if becoming an expert on all the different crew on a merchant ship from the 1800s sounds like fun, this is the game for you. Phil: I love talking about Obra Dinn with other players—discovering the slightly different ways we all came to the same conclusions. It's a clear sign of mastery when a mystery lets you arrive at difficult revelations from a number of different directions. 22. Total War: Three Kingdoms Released 2019 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Creative Assembly) Steven: Total War has explored several important historical periods, but none of them feel as fully realized as Three Kingdoms. That's because Three Kingdoms' emphasizes the characters that defined that era of Chinese history, making for a dramatic and fun strategy game with a lot of wonderful little flourishes and quirks. I love how factions are now defined by the personality of their leaders, like the conniving Cao Cao or the aging dignity of Liu Bao, and how that focus on personality also makes diplomacy actually matter over
