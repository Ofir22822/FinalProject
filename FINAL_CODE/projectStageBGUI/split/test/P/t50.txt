 struggling to figure out what kind of men they want to be is surprisingly relatable. Andy K: The origin story of Majima Goro, as told in Yakuza 0, is honestly one of the best storytelling experiences a game has ever given me. His early chapters, where he’s working as the manager of a cabaret club in Osaka, are incredible: particularly his introduction, where he deals with a drunk customer using nothing but extremely good manners, soundtracked by a swing band. You’ll know what I mean when you see it, and you should, because this is an exceptionally entertaining game set in a dense, vivid portrayal of 1980s Japan. It breakdances on the line between absurd and serious in a really masterful way, and it’s the perfect introduction to a truly one-of-a-kind series. Phil: The series has slowly been making its way to PC—Remastered Collection when, Sega?—but, if you've never played one before, Yakuza 0 is the place to start. It's a prequel, which helps, but more importantly it's the absolute apex of the series' drama, humour and social commentary, embodying its '80s with singular dedication. What I'm saying is: the money flies out of people when you punch them. 15. Hitman 2 Released 2018 | Last position 9 (Image credit: IO Interactive) Fraser: You can kill someone with a homing suitcase. Phil: You can! And it's the reason Hitman 2 is one of the most satisfying stealth games around. Look behind the thematic window dressing of a stoic assassin causing trouble in a series of neighbourhoods and you'll realise that Hitman 2 is a procession of puzzle boxes built on rigidly consistent rules. You're rewarded for discovering and manipulating those rules—learning how the sandbox will react and tailoring your approach to exploit it. It's a rare and beautiful game where breaking your own sense of immersion makes for a more mechanically enjoyable experience. Andy K: I love walking slowly through one of Hitman 2’s impossibly dense maps, looking for cracks in the security to infiltrate, disguises to change into, people to follow, and targets to kill. These moments, the calm before the storm, are what make the series special for me. The planning, the anticipation, and, naturally, the on-the-fly changes of plan as you make a mistake and chaos erupts around you. It also helps that the levels look so beautiful. IO Interactive’s environment designers are some of the best in the business, and Hitman 2 is a killer showcase for their talents. The Isle of Sg?il is a personal highlight: a crumbling old castle perched on a rain-battered island in the North Atlantic, playing host to a creepy secret society party straight out of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. 14. Doom Eternal Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Bethesda) Wes: Doom Eternal spikes my adrenaline so hard I'm exhausted after an hour. If you've ever pondered the videogame equivalent of slamming a 16 oz. Monster Energy, then juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle across a burning rope
