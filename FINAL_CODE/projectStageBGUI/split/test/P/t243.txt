 Plus, there’s never been a more satisfying feeling than zoning a land for residential and first seeing people move in.
Released 2016 85 Joe Skrebels With the mechanical abandon of a Mario game and the worldview of Werner Herzog, Inside spends its three brilliant hours of life holding the player in a loop of intrigue, delight, and disgust. Playdead's bleak, gorgeous puzzle-platformer builds on its predecessor Limbo in all the right places – hello, colour palettes; goodbye, boring gravity puzzles. It leaves us with a game that sleekly, wordlessly pivots from brain-teaser to body horror, until hitting an ending that ranks among gaming’s best, a masterpiece of animation, design and outright strangeness. Inside’s quiet genius lies in how the puzzles creep beyond its ever-changing challenges, and into its story. I’ve spent as much time or more wondering what it all means as I did playing through. If you’ve played, you understand. If you haven’t, you need to. Did You Know? Music for Inside was created by running synthesized sounds through a human skull. Vibrations caused most of its teeth to fall out. The look and movement of... the thing... was inspired by the boar god from Princess Mononoke, the squishy hero from Gish, and crowd surfing. Developer Playdead is partnering with sex doll manufacturer RealDoll for a mysterious $375 dollar collector's edition due in early 2019.

Contra was one of the few cooperative video games of the 8-bit era where player two didn’t feel like a burden dragging you down with every step. With plenty of weapon drops to go around and hordes of enemies coming from every direction, a partner’s firepower was a welcome addition in most situations. And if a friend couldn’t keep up the pace on the waterfall level, you could easily incentivize them to improve their skills by scrolling the screen upward and killing them, which I did whenever my little brother lagged behind. Did You Know? The NES version's use of the Konami Code to grant players 30 lives also popularized the iconic cheat among North American audiences. Its North American localization changed the setting from the year 2633 to 1987, the year the arcade version debuted. The UK version changed the human characters into robots.
Released 2000 83 Brendan Graeber When Tony Hawk Pro Skater came out, it was like nothing anyone had ever played before. It just felt so insanely intuitive, it had great music, it just felt… cool? Gamers, skaters, heshers, posers, there was not one
