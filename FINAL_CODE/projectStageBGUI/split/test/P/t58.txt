 it in the face, and then takes it to a bar to get hammered with it. Despite an old school isometric perspective, it couldn’t be more willing to dump dry old tropes and mess with the ones it keeps, to the point that even much larger, more fully-featured RPGs seem oddly unambitious, and even stagnant, by comparison. Jody: Of all the bold things Disco Elysium does, my favourite is that it says videogames can be political and all the better for it. It starts out cynical about politics ("It's basically all just evil apes dukin' it out on a giant ball" is a good line), and constantly points out the flaws of every ideology including ideology-less centrism, but it builds from there to a point—that politics is messy and confusing but also necessary, that communities should take care of their own most vulnerable members, and that even when it hides behind labels like 'traditionalism' and 'nationalism' fascism can go and do one. It makes other RPGs, especially ones that try to present both sides of every argument even when one side is in favour of indentured servitude, seem wishy-washy and cowardly. James: I punched a kid in the face to earn his respect and it completely changed the ending. That's an RPG, baby. Fraser: Disco Elysium lingers long after it's over. It poses a barrage of questions and constantly challenges with its themes of revolution, nationalism, morality—a kaleidoscope of ideologies all being presented before the game tears them down. Every character seems to have a manifesto, and the game itself almost serves as a manifesto for the future of RPGs, or at least ZA/UM's vision for it. It rips out so many tired RPG cliches and swaps world-shattering stakes for an introspective exploration of a man utterly failing to hold it together. It grabs the genre by the shoulders and shouts "You don't need elves or fights or scenery-chewing villains!" And even when it uses conventional stuff like skill checks, it reinvents the whole system. Skills have personalities. They talk to you. They tell you secrets about the city or offer insights into crime scenes. Playing other RPGs, I just keep thinking about Disco Elysium. It makes most of them seem cautious and set in their ways, and the constant recycling of systems that have, in some cases, barely changed in decades seems less forgivable now that there's this much more appealing alternative. It's exciting, and hopefully it will spur other designers into letting go of all the RPG clutter. Andy K: I knew Disco Elysium was special from pretty much the moment I started playing it for our review—but I didn't bank on it permanently altering my expectations for an entire genre. The freedom you have to shape the protagonist, through the things you say and do, is quite extraordinary. He's a gross, wet ball of clay, and by the end of the game it really does feel like you've moulded him into something distinctly yours. I'm also amazed
