Released 1982 47 Sam Claiborn I restore classic arcade and pinball machines and one of my favorite projects was bringing a Ms. Pac-Man cocktail machine back from the dead. With a rebuilt monitor, restored art, and of course the speed chip that makes it many times faster, Ms. Pac-Man made a popular addition to my homecade. We run an occasional high score competition at IGN and so I thought it would be cool to bring it into our lunch room for a bit. For a month, the machine was never left alone. We work in an office surrounded by the latest toys and games, but Ms. Pac-Man attracted crowds. People changed their commutes to come in early and stay late just to play. Frequently we'd be across the office in a conference room and the strains of the Ms. Pac-Man cutscene music would waft over and make everyone giggle. There are very few games which can create so much happiness after so many decades. Did You Know? Ms. Pac-Man began as a conversion kit for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Midway licensed it and made huge changes, like giving Pac-Man a bow. You can't use standard patterns to solve the mazes in Ms. Pac-Man like you can in Pac-Man thanks to semi-random ghost movements. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani had nothing to do with Ms. Pac-Man, and instead worked on the less popular (but still fun) Super Pac-Man.
