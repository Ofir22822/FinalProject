 can attack and dethrone god. Double bonus: one of the deck types is a race of Victorian Candle People who you melt down (read: kill) in order to reincarnate them as stronger versions of themselves. It's exciting that Slay the Spire has already sparked a burgeoning subgenre. 4. The Witcher 3 Released 2015 | Last position 2 (Image credit: CD Projekt Red) Robin: Such a spectacular, ambitious achievement of an RPG world that it really hasn’t aged much at all. Still an absolute pleasure to explore, and still home to some of the best writing and characters the genre’s ever seen. Finish the 100+ hour main game, and your reward is two expansions that are even better. Hearts of Stone in particular is easily my favourite DLC of all time. Andy K: For me, the magic of The Witcher 3 lies in its side quests. When you pluck an innocuous-sounding bounty from a village notice board, you never know what kind of wild story you're about to get tangled up in. Almost every quest feels weighty and worthwhile, with memorable, unpredictable stories inspired by some of the strangest deep cuts from Eastern European folklore. Wes: Is it redundant to praise The Witcher 3, at this point? Three of the best games on PC are RPGs, now, and The Witcher 3 is the oldest of them. But it's also the grandest and the most immersive, the one with voice acting and motion capture that sucks you in and makes you feel like you're playing through a proper fantasy epic. As Andy says, its speciality is making those little side stories interesting. No RPG hero has ever felt as much like a true working citizen of their world than Geralt. 3. Red Dead Redemption 2 Released 2019 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Rockstar Games) Chris: Easily my favorite game of 2019, checking off all the boxes on my internal wishlist: beautiful and incredibly detailed open world, lots of stuff to do but typically not much pressure to do any of it until I was ready, and believable characters I felt invested in. Many of the missions in the second half felt a bit same-y, but since missions were spaced out over the leisurely 100 or so hours I played it didn't bother me too much. It's a world I'll keep coming back to for years. Andy K: Rockstar's evocative slice of the American West is the only open world that feels genuinely wild and natural to me. They really captured something about nature that seems to have eluded other studios, which makes for a setting that feels wonderfully real as you explore its plains, peaks, and valleys on horseback. 2. Divinity: Original Sin 2 Released 2017 | Last position 1 (Image credit: Larian Studios) Robin: I love that Original Sin 2 applies the same sense of choice and freedom that you find in its sprawling, branching story to its systems-driven combat. Interweaving elemental effects—expanded hugely from the already ambitious first
