 slew of home and garden design features. The building cheats and extensive modding community make this game one of my all time favorites. So many stories to be woven, mysteries to be uncovered, crimes to be solved. This game has it all. Still, I’d wait for a sale before you spend your life savings on it. Emma: I'm a long-time fan of the Sims, but I try to stop myself from playing it too often as it's ridiculously easy for me to become addicted to it all over again. One thing I'm still terrible at is looking after pets, though. My beautiful pink pugs always run away. 17. Apex Legends Released 2019 | Last position 24 (Image credit: EA, Respawn Entertainment) Phil: For the longest time I thought battle royales weren't for me. Apex Legends changed that, by encouraging me not to hide away like a coward, but to embrace the speed, maneuverability and lethality of its design and go looking for a fight. I'm a convert—I've already logged 180 hours since March, and I won't be stopping anytime soon. Jacob: There are few games I'd take in lieu of Titanfall 3, but Apex Legends is a worthy replacement. It completely reshaped my opinion of battle royales up until that point, which were often long drawn-out exercises in scavenging up until a rogue sniper sends you back to the lobby. Apex Legends offered fast-paced action, a tighter map (which breadcrumbs gear and points of interest any which way you go), team respawns, superb gunplay, an inventory system that doesn't suck—you name it, Apex Legends had it, and has been improving on ever since. Emma: Apex Legends has become part of my daily routine. Every night after dinner I'll clock in to grind through a few more battle pass challenges. Each season has introduced viable new legends, as well as interesting changes to the map, such as the bunkers in Season 5. I'm also enjoying the fact that Respawn are continuing to drip feed the characters' backstories into the game, too. The week that Forge was announced before being brutally killed by Revenant felt like a dramatic, twisted soap opera, and I'm all for more drama. What's most impressive about Apex is how long it's managed to retain my attention for so long, and how every season feels like its best yet. Season 6 just introduced crafting, and it really helps to alleviate some of the boring downtime of other battle royales. I've also become a Rampart main for the time being, and have even gravitated towards entirely different weapons this season. I can't wait to see what Respawn adds next. 16. Yakuza 0 Released 2018 | Last position 15 (Image credit: Sega) Jorge: You come to Yakuza 0 for the Japanese '80s crime drama, but you'll stay for the over-the-top fights and wholesome character moments as you try to improve the lives of the citizens of Kamurocho. Also, seeing the series' beloved protagonists, Kiryu and Majima, in their awkward 20s
