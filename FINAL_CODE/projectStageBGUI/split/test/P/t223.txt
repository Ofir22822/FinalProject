 27 Jonathon Dornbush BioShock will likely always be remembered for its game-changing “Would You Kindly?” twist, but the first adventure in Rapture is so much more than a dressed-up dupe. From first encountering a splicer caring for a gun the way a mother cares for her baby to the still-enrapturing Andrew Ryan twist toward the game’s end, BioShock delivers one enrapturing setpiece after another. That’s largely in part thanks to one of the most memorable locations in gaming history. So much story is embedded in the dilapidated hallways and shuttered rooms of Rapture, a decaying underwater labyrinth that demands to be investigated. The mark of a good experience is one that you keep thinking about long after you’ve finished it. And I still haven’t stopped thinking about BioShock, its incredible location, and those awesome Plasmids, over a decade later. Did You Know? Ayn Rand's philosophical system of Objectivism forms much of the foundation that Andrew Ryan's utopian vision for Rapture was rooted in. Even Andrew Ryan's name is a play on Ayn Rand. Some original designs for the Little Sisters, before they became actual little girls, were slugs, crabs, and injured dogs.
Released 2010 26 Dan Stapleton Civilization IV is a great turn-based strategy game on its own, but it wasn’t until the Beyond the Sword expansion that it became truly legendary, and the highlight of the 28-year-old Civilization series. The changes it makes are sweeping: it adds corporations, which add another religion-like layer, fleshes out the espionage system and victory conditions, and enhances the AI to put up a great fight. Meanwhile, random events ranging from tornadoes to baby booms make every playthrough even more unique and eventful than ever before. And we remind you, that’s on top of a game that’s so addictive to begin with that it’s cost us countless nights of sleep whilst chanting its “Just one more turn” mantra or humming its Grammy award-winning theme song. Did You Know? Civilization IV was the first video game to ever win a Grammy – it won in 2011 for its main theme, Baba Yetu. Baba Yetu, which was originally composed for the album Calling All Dawns, is a Swahili-language translation of the Lord's Prayer. Newly researched technologies were narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
Released 1998 25 Zach Ryan There's not a ton left that we can really say about The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time outside of the fact that it's indisputably one of the greatest games ever made. Not only did it redefine action/adventure games, but it completely changed the way the industry thought about 3D combat and exploration. The seven-year gap between A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time saw Zelda fans eagerly anticipating Link’s next adventure, and they weren’t disappointed. Garnering nearly unanimous critical praise and fan adoration, Ocarina of Time was quickly regarded as one of the most important and groundbreaking games of all time, and for good reason. A sweeping, epic tale that introduced new characters, new lore, and an ever-expanding timeline
