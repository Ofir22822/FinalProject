 whenever I play how developer ZA/UM seems to constantly be two steps ahead of me, with some kind of reward or pay-off, even if it's a small one, for any harebrained idea I happen to dream up. The only really bad thing I have to say about Disco Elysium is that it's ruined all other RPGs for me. If only they were all this improbably deep. Jacob: If I asked you to describe the worst hangover you've ever experienced, it wouldn't hold a candle to the one you're about to live out in Disco Elysium. Wes: The writing! I want to bathe in these words. There's a joyous reverence shimmering off every sentence in Disco Elysium. It feels so alive with its mission to prove that words alone can make a masterpiece. Turns out they can. Plenty of RPGs have great writing. Disco Elysium goes out of its way, though, to truly elevate its text. Tremendous care went into the presentation—the font, the way text unfurls, the visual effects when you pass or fail a skill check—to keep you glued to these words. Disco turns traditional RPG skills into luscious conversations, with each voice in your head adding color, clarity, and humor to a scene far more effectively than graphics could. It's a thousand times more interesting and creative than a companion in a BioWare-style RPG chiming in with an opinion on your latest binary decision. I love games that truly feel like they were made by individual human beings, and it's staggering that every word, in a game of this scope, can feel so personal.
