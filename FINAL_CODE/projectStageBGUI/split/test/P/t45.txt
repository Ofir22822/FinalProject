 match wits with the huge, near-immortal Xenomorph from the first film. I think it overstays its welcome by a few hours, but that's a small complaint when the run up to the finale puts you through increasingly terrifying scenarios. Shout out to the Working Joes, the androids who give you something else to worry about when the Alien decides to go hunting elsewhere on the ship. 26. What Remains of Edith Finch Released 2017 | Last position 11 (Image credit: Giant Sparrow) Rachel: What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange, fantastical tales about the doomed Finch household. As the last living member, Edith has returned to the family home to discover her relative's hidden histories, exploring each of the family's many rooms to find out how each member met their unfortunate end. It's a first-person narrative adventure that tells surprisingly woeful vignettes in an artful and gentle way. Andy K: This is the only game I love that I’ll never play again. One moment in the story hit me so hard that I don’t think I can go through it again, and so that original playthrough will remain my first and last encounter with the game. But I still think anyone who values story in games should play it, because it tells its tale of an eccentric family in a wonderfully clever, elegant way. The Finch household is an incredibly evocative place too, stuffed with secrets and subtle details that help flesh the story out. Tom: There's something quite magical about Edith Finch's anthology of tragedies. It gets dark at times, but I came away strangely moved by the game's presentation of a strange family that lives in the weirdest house ever. The tag 'walking simulator' used to be an insult, but time and again we can see that it's a good format for storytelling. 25.

On the surface, all you need to do is capture/defend your objective, so beginners can quickly grasp the aim of the game, but veterans with thousands of hours clocked can still find plenty of ways to improve all the way up to professional level. With guns that can end your round with one bullet and hundreds of tactical micro decisions needing to be made during its many intense moments, I often need half an hour to calm down after a session. Recent new operators and revamps to some of its labyrinthine maps have been strong, too, but the battle against toxicity and bugs isn't over. Evan: Ubisoft deserves praise for sustaining a game like Siege with continuous meaningful updates despite not being a studio with a ton of institutional experience making competitive multiplayer games. Now a five-year-old FPS, Ubi continues to disrupt Siege's meta with experimental new operators (Iana, one of my recent favorites, spawns a holographic copy of herself that she can pilot around) while still
