 over 400. Naughty Dog claims 30,000 cans of soda were drunk during production. The Tibetan village sequence was inspired by the 2008 indie game The Graveyard by Tale of Tales.
Released 2016 50 Joe Skrebels Blizzard performed alchemy here. Overwatch should be leaden – a Team Fortress cover version with two-and-a-half modes and a MOBA approach to character design. And yet what we have is gold. The key here is in how Blizzard looked beyond simply making a good shooter – it made an interesting one. Its backstory is PG-13 Pixar, its characters are diverse and lovable, and its community engagement is… well, it’s Jeff Kaplan. Pro gamers, cosplayers, fanfic writers, ARG detectives and everyone in between have all been given a reason to play a single game – no mean feat. And this isn’t to play down the game itself – Blizzard didn’t make a Team Fortress clone, it made a successor. It’s a swift, satisfying shooter, with a whirling game-to-game internal meta of character picks and counter-picks.

It’s a surprisingly rich and juicy mystery that poses interesting questions about the future of human civilization amid ever-advancing technology. Building JC Denton up as your own custom-built cyborg secret agent is a joy, allowing you to mix and match upgrades to suit your playstyle anywhere on the spectrum of action to stealth. This, naturally, leads to a great deal of replayability – no matter what augmentations you choose, Deus Ex’s levels have a different path that can only be accessed by someone of your particular skills. You might fight your way through a group of enemies, sneak past them undetected, or hack their automated gun turret and turn it against them. You might even complete the entire story without harming a soul. Did You Know? Deus Ex was one of the earliest licensed Unreal Engine games. A film adaptation was announced in 2002, but never materialized. The developers accidentally predicted 9/11 by leaving the Twin Towers out of the New York City skyline... one year before the attack.
Brandin Tyrrel Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn was very much a leader of the pack during the RPG renaissance of the early 2000s and is still an excellent example of that genre’s strengths. From its fantastically written characters and story to its vast arsenal of weapons, armors, and
