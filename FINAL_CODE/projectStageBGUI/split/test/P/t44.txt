 30. Terraria Released 2011 | Last position New entry Wes: I paid 10 bucks for Terraria nine years ago, played many hours of it, and was satisfied. It's surreal to go back to it in 2020, after its last (free) major update, to find the same compelling crafting and exploration expanded with literally thousands of items, massive bosses, and secrets I have to read a wiki to find. Those additions long ago distinguished Terraria from being a 2D Minecraft clone, but it's still staggering just how much awaits discovery in this humble-looking game. 29. Battletech Released 2018 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) Fraser: I could build mechs all day. There’s something very calming about putting together titanic killing machines. Sticking jetpacks on axe-wielding behemoths, swapping out piddly little lasers for armour-melting super cannons—it’s not a bad life. The battles are great, of course, but I’m always excited to get back to the garage so I can tweak my lance. Jorge: Battletech has everything I want, space politics, giant mechs, and the never-ending existential dread of trying to keep my band of mercenaries from going bankrupt. Evan: Post-launch updates filled in what was a somewhat shallow sandbox at launch, making Battletech a more varied campaign game. But what stands out two years later is the fundamental, pugilistic style of fighting that mechs promote as unique vehicles. Unlike the many zombies, helicopters, spiders, and goblins we fight in videogames, mechs can take a hit. The slow death that mechs experience, their bruises, their limps, their shattered limbs—it's a metallic boxing match that plays out over big battlefields. And like boxing, the knockdown and the knockout are the biggest moments. 28. League of Legends Released 2009 | Last position 26 (Image credit: Riot Games) Steven: League of Legends defined esports, but even 11 years on it also continues to be a ridiculously fun and challenging game. Recent changes in season 10 make matches even more dynamic and unpredictable in a good way, and Riot's aggressive balancing keeps the competition fierce. Fraser: I’ve played one game of League of Legends and that was enough for me. Teamfight Tactics, on the other hand, has somehow managed to get its hooks in me deep. I never make good builds, I can never find the characters I need, I get progressively more drunk and frustrated every time I play, and I love it. 27. Alien: Isolation Released 2014 | Last position 23 (Image credit: SEGA) Andy K: The best horror game on PC—and a pretty great stealth game too. Your alien adversary is unpredictable, dynamic, and adaptive, which makes it a terrifying thing to have stalking you from the shadows of Sevastopol. And the space station’s hard-edged sci-fi aesthetic, inspired by the 1979 movie, is to die for. Literally, if you spend too long standing around admiring it. Tom: I love the chunky bulkheads and spectacular lighting of the station. The Alien is still magnificent, of course, and it's still so refreshing to
