 the course of a campaign. Instead of fighting faceless factions, you're sitting down with enemy generals with their own stories, motivations, and weaknesses, and it makes the battles feel all the more intense when they're the result of interpersonal conflict between warlords. Fraser: Right out the gate, Three Kingdoms was already a strong contender for the best Total War game, and since launch Creative Assembly have only added more to make it stand apart from the rest of the series. Expansions have introduced new campaigns that slot neatly into the regular campaign, fleshing out the timeline with more events and factions without making it feel bloated. The phenomenal campaign is now even better, then, with a greater variety of starting scenarios and a bunch of new factions with unusual mechanics. Even without that, though, you won’t find a more polished or better looking Total War. 21. Final Fantasy XIV Released 2013 | Last position 28 (Image credit: Square Enix) Steven: If there's one MMO you should play in 2020, FF14 is it. The latest expansion uses years of careful character development and world building to deliver a dimension-spanning gut-punch that rivals the series' best, and I really enjoy how FF14 tells such a coherent yet expansive story. But FF14 is just a joy to play. It's classes are distinct and fun, and dungeons and bosses are so unique and well-crafted that I don't mind running them over and over again for new gear.

As a tank I successfully pulled a green dragon off puddles of poisonous goop as my companions battered it into submission. I felt like a hero.
20. Half-Life: Alyx Released 2020 | Last position New entry (Image credit: Valve) Tyler: I don't like the horror aspects. I'm a wuss, and handling zombie corpses in VR makes me too nervous. Handling all other things with the Gravity Gloves, however, is fantastic. It's like you're Thor and everything is your hammer. Chris: Alyx doesn't really do anything groundbreaking when it comes to how you interact with the world in VR. It's interactions are super-satisfying, like Tyler said: using the grabbity gloves to pull things into your hands, reloading guns, examining objects. It all works great without feeling like anything particularly new. But where it's most impressive technically is how well it does locomotion and smooth movement. I've never had any real motion-sickness in VR, but I do get tired of it pretty quickly. I get headaches, I become hyper-aware of having controllers in my hands and
