 even beyond its affirming story, Florence offers a vibrant art style brought to life by a wonderful soundtrack filled to the brim with light and intricate piano and cello motifs. Alan Dexter: Magic the Gathering: Arena (Image credit: Wizards of the Coast) What's that? MTG Arena isn't on the list? An oversight surely. If you want to exercise your grey matter there isn't a game that comes close. I've been playing the cardboard version for over 20 years and this is the best digital version by a country mile. The fact I still play daily is surely all the recommendation needed. And no, you don't need to drop any cash on it to enjoy it. Fraser Brown: The Beginner's Guide (Image credit: Everything Unlimited Ltd) An analysis of some levels from the perspective of a designer and fan, The Beginner's guide is a fascinating exploration of game design that becomes something so much more. It's insightful and uncomfortable and—actually, I'm going to leave it there. It's brilliant and you should find out for yourself. Wes Fenlon: Satisfactory It's really all in the name. Even incomplete in Early Access, this factory building sim is so damn satisfying in how it lets you optimize designs, then sit back and watch your elaborate construction whir with life. God I love building things that build things that build things that build... Dave James: Football Manager (Image credit: Sports Interactive) There is always a longterm FM career going on my home PC, and stored in the cloud so I can access whenever, from wherever. It's my comfort, my happy place, even when it's making me more angry than a bunch of little computer people have any right to. It's also the best RPG going. Fight me. Jody Macgregor: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Image credit: spike) The best game inspired by the movie Battle Royale is an extended parody of Phoenix Wright where gifted kids are trapped by a robot bear (just roll with it), and forced to murder each other. Only the killer who evades guilt in a class trial goes free. It's a comedy. Tom Senior: Mortal Shell (Image credit: Playstack) Dark Souls is an enigmatic game, but the soulslike Mortal Shell manages to be even more obscure. You play a pale spirit who can occupy the forms of four fallen warriors, each with their own skills and strange backstories. Fantastic combat and the innovative Shell system sets it apart from the games that inspired it.
