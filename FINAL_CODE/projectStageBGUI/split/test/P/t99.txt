 first game, King's Field. The series bears several striking similarities to the manga Berserk, a major influence on director Hidetaka Miyazaki. Early ideas for a title were "Dark Race" and "Dark Ring," but both were scrapped due to controversial connotations overseas.
Christian Holt What can you say about the definitive fighting game, the game that has spawned countless imitators, acolytes, and sequels? Street Fighter II remains a classic in video game lore, making series mainstays Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li as well as words like “Hadouken” part of the public lexicon.

Example: literally everyone reading this can hum its theme song, right now, from memory. See? Now it's playing in your head again. You're welcome. Did You Know? Super Mario Bros. established Nintendo's home console dominance in America and Japan. Shigeru Miyamoto wanted to let Mario ride a dinosaur, but hardware limitations didn't allow it at the time. It was one of the first among six video games inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame at the National Museum of Play.
Ryan McCaffrey Few games had more of a buildup prior to their release than Halo 2, and even fewer managed to live up to them in the way that Halo 2 did. Master Chief taking the fight with the Covenant to Earth was epic, action-packed, and visually stunning on the original Xbox. Sure, the campaign didn't so much end as much as stopped, but the shocking reveal of the playable Arbiter and his story that mirrored the Chief's was a twist no one saw coming. Furthermore, and perhaps even
