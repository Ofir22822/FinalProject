 Personal Picks We love many more games than we can fit onto one list, so here the PC Gamer team has spotlighted a few of their favorites that didn't make the cut. James Davenport: Hylics 2 (Image credit: Mason Lindroth) As a Wayne of some importance, it's up to you to stop the reconstitution of Gibby so everyone can get back to slapping bugs. I'm still not sure what Hylics 2 is about, but that's kind of OK. An absurdist RPG made of 3D-scanned clay models, it plays like a long-lost RPG from the 1970s. Harry Shepherd: Journey (Image credit: Thatgamecompany) thatgamecompany's wordless wonder has long been my favourite videogame, and last year it finally found its definitive home on PC. Enhanced by a majestic score from Austin Wintory, this entrancing two-hour epic sees you floating over undulating sand dunes and sweeping through dank caves to reach a twinkling mountain peak. Pint-sized perfection. Phil Savage: Guild Wars 2 (Image credit: ArenaNet) Its combat is punchy and satisfying, its community is helpful and engaged, and its approach to levelling makes it easy to get involved in any of its regular updates—even if you haven't played for years. So many live service games would be improved if they took some inspiration from Guild Wars 2's model. Rachel Watts: If Found... (Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) Dreamfeel's coming-of-age visual novel has both beautiful and gut-wrenching authenticity. It follows a trans woman's return to her Irish hometown during the '90s, having to deal with the troubles of being a young queer adult. It's an ethereal story of awkward crushes, punk concerts, and a black hole that threatens to destroy reality. Chris Livingston: West of Loathing (Image credit: Asymmetric) RDR2 isn't the only open world cowboy game on PC. West of Loathing's art may just be simple stick figures, but the writing is brilliant and it's overstuffed with jokes. I played long after I'd finished the RPG's main quest, just to make sure I'd found every last scrap of humor. Robin Valentine: Mortal Kombat 11 (Image credit: Warner Bros.) Not just the only fighting game with a genuinely good story campaign, but for my money the most accessible entry into the genre there’s ever been. Easy combos, a slower pace, and a whole suite of fantastic tutorials make this a gory showdown that anyone can enjoy. Err, unless you’ve got a weak stomach. Andy Kelly: L.A. Noire (Image credit: Team Bondi) Rockstar's most divisive game is also one of my favourites. This lavish replica of 1940s Los Angeles is a dream for anyone who's ever watched a film noir or read a Raymond Chandler novel and wished they could be there. And a cast of genuinely great actors (including several familiar faces from Mad Men) really brings the story to life. Jacob Ridley: Florence (Image credit: Annapurna Interactive, Mountains) Florence is a snapshot of falling in, and drifting out of, love. It's delivered through simple interactions—each puzzle is intrinsically tied to Florence's thoughts and feelings. But
