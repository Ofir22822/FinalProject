This game is a masterpiece
This is one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. The gameplay is simple yet difficult. The armors and monsters all look fantastic.
What is basketball doing in my Casino game?
Great game for basketball fans
Good in terms of gameplay and modes, but not easy to learn.
More of a gambling simulator
Because NBA2K20 Should only Be For Ages 11
amazing
Imagine buying a sixty dollar game and having to pay for everything and the game has a literal slot machine. You heard me, actual gambling. Surprise mechanics, my ... They really need to change the rating. Honestly just get your kid a decent game that they can actually enjoy.
Great game. My only concern is that the Nba2k games are the same every year with no big changes.Also, it may take a little time to get use to the controls.
It's a very good, well-built game in terms of graphics and gameplay. The modes were very well built, with MyCareer and MyLeague. MyGM is a little disappointing, but ok nonetheless. The MyPlayer builder is AMAZING! Now, onto the cons. You don't really get to upgrade your MyPlayer much without VC. You'll probably get to about 88 OVR if you're lucky. Another thing is consumerism. In MyCareer, your player openly gets deals with different brands sponsored by the NBA, such as Beats, Gatorade, and Foot Locker. You can also choose between shoe brands such as Jordan, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Anta, and New Balance. They openly promote these products. There is also a shoe builder, where you can create your own shoe. You choose between any brand you want.
Worse than fallout 76
a great game that is fine for kids of all ages

Difficult. If your kid's been playing games for five years, shooters, mostly, they'll be good enough at it.

i think it is good because of the reactions
Gears 5 is a game which yes may have a bit of blood but hat can be turned off in the settings . So the only bad thing is the language but the language isn’t really really bad it uses the s word and a very few amount of f bombs . The only reason I’ve said 11 is because of the language . Other than that the game is great. In addition this game also represents teamwork .
This is only pseudo-freemium, and one of THE BEST "action" games for younger kids!
Fun for the whole family.
Brief intro, I'm somewhat familiar with a lot of freemium models for games, I always seem to try them out, most I quickly give up on. Super Kirby Clash, however, is part of a "new style" of freemium that is MUCH more about "paying what's appropriate" than manipulating you to pay for the same thing multiple times. So let's back up a moment, and say why it's good. You can play with 4 people at a time (including locally on one Switch), with simple controls, against engaging and cartoony bosses. Even if you take
