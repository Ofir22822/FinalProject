 Lightsaber Throw and much more that will keep you engaged. Also, I think that BD-1 is my favorite Star Wars droid in the entire franchise. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is definitely worth buying, if you want to have a satisfying and engaging gameplay of a day in the life of a Jedi.
A little Violent though
I think that this game is great for pre-teens who are starting to be allowed to play some M (I'm Austrailian) games. Note I have not finished the game, so I may not know some details, but I doubt there will be much worse than what I have already seen. It is a great game that I enjoy playing. The violence in the game is more limited than this website, and most national ratings suggest, as, whilst you wield a lightsaber in the game, there is no blood. Alien and stormtrooper corpes do lie on the ground and not despawn until your next save, however they are not gross in the silightest, and should be fine for any child above 10. There is no sex, or drugs/alcohol in the game, and the only language is the word bastard, which I have only heard once, and doubt it will be used again in the remaining section of the game. The game is not addictive, and can actually get tedious after long amounts of play, preventing kids from grinding to upgrade - the format also prevents this, as it is a full campaign game, with most of the upgrades being progressive. The main character is a great role mode as he stands up for what he thinks is right with the rebels, and displays the positive messages of not giving up, and freedom of voice. Whilst it is a single-player only game, it is good to have some of these for if your friends can't play with you, or you don't have wifi. This game is extremely fun, and I would reccomend it to any responsible kid above the age of 10, especially as a smooth transition to late PG to early M games (Once again, I'm Australian, so the ratings might be different for you). Although it is reasonably expensive, you can get it a lot cheaper second hand, or from some discount stores. Overall, great game, get it now.
This game is GREAT!!! I love how there is combat but also fun and challenging puzzles. Cal and BD-1 are a great team, and Cal only kills things that attack him first. There are a few dark spots, but never any blood.
I think this is an amazing game. It is a bit violent but if you are a star wars fan than you know that violent is not exactly the same as other games. Didn't catch any blood. It is a very complex game to learn though and if you don't play for a while than you WILL forget the controls but over all it is a great game. Big Star Wars fan
The game has very few
