 10 or over.
lets see the good of the game before we see the bad...It helps children co-operate with teammates.Next bad stuff in this game Is hard to find.There is blood but you don't notice,There is a Hero that smokes a cigar a lot of the time.Some heros have reaveling costumes but That dosn't matter the first thing is online chat.But this can be avoided by not joining parties. I play this on my youtube channel and it's child friendly enough.
Just because there is guns doesn't mean that it is violent and bloody. No blood and it more like lasers that you shoot. Young kids might not like it because of how hard it is.
