 relived he then explained how you could turn off all the blood and gore. And the fatalities were hard to do so I was surprised about how it changed my view and I don’t want others to have to worry it a game where you fight but you don’t see sexualized themes at all and the cussing is probably better than a 7th grades it just one person ( his name is Kano but it’s better not to play him) and I would recommend this game to others. It also has a great message it follows a army unit where it shows women leading the way and I think it represents that men and woman are powerful so I can’t say it enough I recommend it
By far the best one yet.
Mortal Kombat did always have graphic violence, but I'm disappointed they added strong language and sexual themes in it. This game now sexualizes women. I wish it would go back to how it was.
I play video games with my kids (15 and 12) and not averse to violence or FPS games (CoD, Destiny, SuperHot). This is off the charts gory. Close-ups of faces as characters die, organs or spines ripped out and quivering, violence often in slow motion. Unlike the previous Mortal Kombats (or other games with close up violence), the graphics are unnervingly realistic -- adding new dimensions to the viewer experience. It honestly makes me a little ill. Some kids have no trouble with this level of violence but they probably should. Both my kids read this review and say it is accurate. The game-playing aspects are excellent - with highly customizable characters, a solid campaign and strong female characters. But "stupendously violent" (one of the top game reviewers commentary) is the best way to put it.
can not believe this, after 25 years they destroy amazing female characters before they had an amazingly strong structure with nice custom now they cover from head to toe.. really !! men's half-naked but women all cover up. frost looks like a boy, jade face no comment. kitana looks plan I am sure Anita Sarkeesian has to do something with it she really needs to find a real job and leave the games alone.
Violence: 9/10. Very gory, characters are eviscerated, dismembered, mutilated, basically every violent thing in the book. Docking one point because it's extremely over the top and unrealistic, you never would feel sorry for the characters/get the feeling their in pain. Sex: 3/10: Shao Khan, MK's local creepy uncle makes references to his harems and sex slaves. These are very few and far between. Female characters sexuality is toned down compared to MK9. Swearing: 8/10: Frequent uses of the "F" word and other things. Drugs: 2/10: Kano frequently drinks. Quality: 9/10: Game is extremely fun, controls are tight and responsive. Story mode is amazing and doesn't take itself too seriously (which is why MK10's story sucked). The Krypt and Towers of Time are a tad too grindy for my taste
