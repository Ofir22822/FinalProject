 kid play it. It all depends on the parent, but for parents who have never seen the game and your child is begging you to let him/her to play it, I'm going to tell you about the game. First of all, Apex legends is a free to play shooter game on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 1, and PlayStation 4. Apex legends include lots of guns, first person shooting, and some blood. The blood in apex legends is very mild and there is no gore. There is a lot of teamwork and communication involved to win the game. There are a lot of in-game purchases, so if you let your child buy stuff on games, that is all your choice.
This is a great game that heavily focuses on team work and working together. I have a 12 year old that I let play and so far I can’t object. The only thing that made me a little skeptic at first was that there was blood but as I played it I barely noticed it. Overall a great game
WORST GAME EVER
it is afine name
Apex legends is from observation, an excellent video game and is for the most part, harmless.my 10 year old child loves it!
Suitable for 12 up
Never install this game ever again, terrible should never have been made delete this game
I think that this game is a very active and thrilling game. Whilst it is indeed a 16+ rating game, I think that other than moderate violence, it should be appropriate for ages 7 and above. However it does mainly depend on the personality and maturity of your child, so don't just take my word for it.
I was a little hesistant about letting my son (age 13 play this at first), although I played a few games myself and realised that the violence is unrealistic and there are no graphic scenes. Overall it is a great game, although I would say under 10 should not be allowed. 16 is too high a rating for this game. I also think that it encourages team spirit.
from a gaming parent
"GAO" is a very well defined "space survival" with a good mix of fun and realism although the game is mostly about surviving a never ending barrage of aliens (many are creepy looking spider/bug things) its not as graphic as space horror games like dead space, and most of the gore is infact alien secretions used to show them "infesting" your ship as far as letting children play: if your child has seen the film starship troopers played 5 nights at Freddies or finds insects and aliens fascinating (like mine) they'll be fine playing this game if you worry about them playing a game, participate in it (so that you can see and judge for yourself) though as always a parent should use their own gut instincts when buying games for children
Occasionally difficult but deliciously written RPG
Violence: Mild ship vs. other ship/bug/monster combat. When killed bugs emit a tiny blood splatter effect that quickly disappears. Most
