Mild Gore with Mature Themes

way to much language for a christian.
One of the best games of the year with strong language and powerful themes
It is a great game for mature kids
Would translate into a 16 movie
Not that bad at all
If you seriously think a kid should be able to "handle" mature content you are stupid. Terribly uncomfortable situations with incest, implied sex, etc (and doesn't include the language and violence). If your 12 year old can "handle" that, then I feel bad for you when your 12 year old is 15-18 years old.

I am a lifelong gamer and I enjoy sharing games with my kids. However, I always play them first especially when it’s a company like rockstar games. I love their games, but they’re not suitable for kids. Red redemption 2 is just a slightly more tame version of grand theft auto set in the old west. You can murder people at random with multiple weapons and in multiple ways and although sexual scenes are not clearly depicted as they are in GTA, they are very much implied in RR2. In the saloon, women ask you if you want to have a good time and you have the option to decline. Also, there are bath houses within the hotels where ladies ask you if you need assistance bathing for a fee. If you accept, you observe the female character reaching into the bubbles between the male main character’s legs and asking if he would like to be scrubbed anywhere else. This game is open play, so there are infinite things to explore. For those parents saying on here that there’s no innapropriate content for kids, my suspicion is that they simply haven’t explored all of the game’s infinite possibilities in open play. You really have to get around the environment, try every door, every store, every service... My opinion, after playing about 6 hours of guilty pleasure into it and thoroughly enjoying the game; I will NOT be allowing my 13 year old to play it.
This game has great action and adventure. There is a lot of violence. There is some rude language and sex stuff but a great game( probably best for adults though)
Red Dead Redemption 2 is an incredible game. The graphics are amazing, and the storyline is gripping and very enjoyable. However, this game does include mature aspects. I’ll run over some of the things to look out for. Drugs: In certain locations there are dedicated Drug stores in which players can buy Horse stimulants, Human healing items and even Cocaine gum and tobacco. Players can also be seen smoking from cigars. However I don’t feel like this is a problem, as the player isn’t seen snorting cocaine for example. Gore/Violence: It’s the Wild West! Expect blood splattering from faces,
