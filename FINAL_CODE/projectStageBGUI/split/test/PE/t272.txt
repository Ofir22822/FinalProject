 1 character named McCree smokes a cigar, but that's the only drug explicit in game. When players get hurt, the character may say damn or hell occasionally. Easy to learn. AMAZING game, and is worth your money.
I have gotten really addicted to Overwatch. It is a multiplayer shooter which follows the story of a team of heroes who defend the planet. The thing I like the most about this game is the emphasis on teamwork which means that it promotes this as well. Another positive is the many heroes and classes to play which makes Overwatch so fun and diverse. It is very fun and only gets boring after a long while. The violence is cartoony and there is no blood or swearing. This is probably the most age appropriate shooter out there.
This game is amazing if you like shooter games. If you are thinking about buying this game I will give you some tips. So, this game is expensive. It's 59.99 (USD)! But if you are willing to pay for this then keep reading. About the game. This game is rated T for Teen but from the gameplay, it should be rated Everyone 10+. The game has very little blood, its fast passed and cartoony. Also make sure you look at videos of this game too. Lastly the bad part. The reason i say MATURE in the title is because of the Online Interactions. There are many adults that do not care how young your child is and cuss using voice chat. Yes there is a way to turn that off, but if you don't there can be people cussing left and right. This happens on almost ANY online game you play. These people are usually cussing because they are mad that they lost or died. However there are some good people but rarely from what i have seen. Another thing to consider is that if your child does not have a microphone he can not talk to anybody using voice chat. If he does he can talk to random people. So, after all that if you know your child is mature enough for this and you will pay the price then go right ahead and get this game. (I am a gamer myself and have played many games like this)
Overwatch has a great storyline, multiplayer, and characters that you will love. Some might say it looks "cartoonish" but it looks pretty realistic. If you want to have a fun time, this game is for you.
It’s not TOO bad. I mean there’s a little bit of bad stuff but come on, most games have that
Issues: One character smokes a cigar, few characters when using the default outfit (extremely easy to obtain more outfits) some characters wear revealing clothing, but does not show up in-game frequently, and if playing on computer there is open chat that has little filtering but can be disabled. other that that it has non-realistic violence that focuses on an objective rather than killing.
I think overwatch
