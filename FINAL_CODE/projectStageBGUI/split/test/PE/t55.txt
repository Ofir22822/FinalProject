 way too overprotective and yeah it might have blood and some rude words but this game is THE BEST. It is a must play for 11 year and up. But there is drugs use but still if your kid is mature then go for it!!
My son really wanted this game and so I got it for him as a Christmas gift a while back last Christmas There is a option to turn off blood and there is no sex common sense why did you guys say that
I beat the game 10 times only saw one F word there is no sex at all i do not know why it says that on the disk the violence is fine because you can turn off blood
This games main issue is violence and if you child is "mature" enough for violence then the game shouldn't an issue. There is some swearing but not too much.
One of the most broken Nintendo Switch games I've played!
I have experienced a lot of gameplay glitches and crashes that I hope to see patched soon.
Not healthy or fun!
Not that violent
12+
11 and up
Teamwork and skill building
kids over 9 can play
It's ok for kids to play
Violent
This game is not good for any age child in my opinion . I see nothing positive about military sniper “ games” for children. My son is 14 and has woken up with nightmares after me stupidly letting him play this I hate to even call it a game . I’m very disappointed we have things like this out there that we are exposing our children too it’s sad that we can’t be more creative than shooting and killing
Not that violent Yes it's got guns but you aren't killing anyone just destroying robots and I think it's not as violent as killing people. I think kids over the age of 9 or 10 and up should be allowed to play this game. I hope that this helped other parents as myself decide if they should let their child play this game.
I watch my son play it and i think its fine. Not really like EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS, but more like a middle maturity level but it's not too bad.
No blood or gore compared to zombie games it can play multi player no sex it does say 1 swear word once after about playing like 5 hours of it no consumerism a little violence with te guns not to much though
Personally I think that it is a good game for children there is no killing people only robots and there are only a few blood print here and there .
Guns and creepy robots attacking you while you just shoot it with no real happy quality
Classic RPG That Is Recommended for Long-Time Fans and Newcomers
My favorite game of all time!
A lot more mature than you would think
Classic JRPG has aged fairly well and is ok for older tweens and up
Beware the Wall Market quest. XD
