 you think your child is mature enough for this game. I hope you found this review helpful.
It's a call of duty game, so its going to have some blood, but the movie Mulan has blood in it. I like it because I'm a sucker for the fps gerne. Its just over priced, not including in-game purchases. Its more of a "Yay, I got this game for christmas!" kind of a game. i think a mature 9-year old could play this, but you should just leave this one to the middle schoolers.
Its a good game, i would just turn of blood/gore settings and turn off explicit language
