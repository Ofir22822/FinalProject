 a decent game but the writers seemed to have spent more time trying to cram as many curse words and blasphemies in the game (dialog, quest titles, labels on selectable choices, even swapping one curse word out for another in the subtitles) than work on making the story interesting. In addition, the characters feel like they were taken directly from ‘The Walking Dead’ (Hmm, the main character’s name is almost identical to Negan, he drives a motorcycle and uses a crossbow). Because of this, the story feels like it was written by amateurs who didn’t know how to create something original.
I think that days gone is a appropriate game for kids 10 and up when my kids 10 and 14 both wanted it I hesitated but I saw video And It Wasn't that bad and the main character is a biker and he does things that make him a good person like helping survivors any parent with a kid age 10 and up should get this game!
Very fun and entertaining game
Im going to make it quick this i game is really fun and keeps my kids distracted so I can watch football and this game is a little violent but surprisingly not bloody get this game!
Generic in every way. Days gone provides players with a empty world. Interesting concept poor execution.
Days Gone is a fun game and adults like me can find this game interesting i even found myself once staring at the game for 30 minutes till the dinner alarm went off and there is a little swearing but nothing racist or crude i think every mature kid should have Days Gone
I think this game deserves a 9 and up its fun and educational any parent should give their kid this game if there old enough and this is really entertaining and the character is brave smart and funny in appropriate ways and there is only a tiny bit of cussing i think any parent sould get this game for their kid!
I played this game with my son and we loved it. At first I was skeptical because of the Mature rating but my son is 14 and told me that his friends all were getting Days Gone. The game is about I biked in the zombie apocalypse who is searching for his wife. The games story, is long and fun. It’s a memorable story with memorable characters. The violence though throughout the game isn’t at all bad compared to other zombie games. There’s barely any violent cut- scenes, gore, and even little blood. You handle with a lot of zombies but they barely even shed blood. The profanity on the other hand isn't too bad (mainly damn is used) but can be disabled from the games settings. Once playing a while I checked it out on common sense and to my suppose it said that there was a rape scene. I played the game with my son and the rape scene doesn’t exist. All that happens is men
