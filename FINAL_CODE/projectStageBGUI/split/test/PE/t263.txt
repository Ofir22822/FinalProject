 won't understand it very well until they're around 11-12 years old. But there is loot boxes, which kids might put more money into.
Where to start? This game is a great introduction to shooters. It has intuitive controls, easy-to-grasp abilities, and not much blood. The characters are mostly heroic and respectable, and aside from two (Reaper, who literally relishes the idea of death, and Sombra, who's just a power hungry freak), even the villains can be understood to a degree. I don't think that consumerism should be dialed up to a four, as you only but cosmetics, and unlike Fortnite or other games, your character is appealing and unique-looking without a skin or modification. Also, sex should certainly not be at two. I'm aware some characters are wearing things that aren't eskimo jackets (Oh wait! One character IS wearing an eskimo jacket!), but it seems wrong somehow. Some people bring up the unmonitered chat, but if you use the convenient communication wheel to talk, which has options like "Defend the checkpoint!" or "I need healing!", you could go entire matches without ever popping open the chat window. You can't not look at voice chat, which is uncensored as well, but you can mute it and that's that. The violence really isn't that horrible either, as a very small fraction of the characters have actual firearms. Most have swords, laser guns, giant hammers, small hammers, rocket launchers that are made of car parts, oversized gauntlets that shoot shrapnel, or other bizarre weapons. In other words, if you're okay with your child watching star wars or the chronichles of narnia, this should be okay in terms of violence. There is a cowboy in the game who smokes at all times, but I didn't even notice for the first month of playing the game. This doesn't really fit any catagories, but it should be said that when using their "ultimate" ability, all heroes will shoult out their catchphrase, and it will. Most of these are harmless, silly sayings like "Nerf this!", "It's high noon...", or other simple blips that let everyone know a powerful attack is coming. However, one character, Reaper, screams the word "DIE" repeatedly. You can turn off voice lines to prevent this, but then you can't hear the other ultimates coming and are at a disadvantage.
I’ve played this game since last Christmas, and I love it. I wouldn’t let your kid play it if they are under 10.
The game has almost no violence at all, and is a great game for young kids and adults alike but something you should consider when buying the game is that it can get boring quite quickly well for me at least. Overwatch is basically the same thing over and over again but the skins and the over 30 heros can make that not so boring but i still found it boring when playing. Also a few heros do have bombs and one apears to be crazy which could be associated with drugs and some
