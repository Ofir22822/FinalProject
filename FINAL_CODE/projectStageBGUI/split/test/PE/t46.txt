 is this game I’m not going to lie there is gore theres not much profanity what so ever. I would say gore is what gives this game a M rating . If you play the game you pretty much have a choice if you want to go try hard or just play the worst thing in the game is doing a Fatality but the thing about doing a fatality Is it’s really hard to do and it take practice if I kid plays the game there not going to be able to do a fatality it’s really complex and with out fatality’s this game is a T related game I think the right age to play is 12/13 + because this game is not that bad trust me on that I let my 13 and 14 year old sons play this game I sat right next to them for a good amount of time to see what the game is really about I’ve even played it myself for a little while if you think this game is to Extreme Then maybe reconsider that choice if they just play the story mode and just play the game and not do fatalities every second they will be fine
All Mortal Kombat games are fun. Though these newer mortal kombat brutal fatal kills now, I feel like are less brutal than the older games of this franchise. Because the finishing moves are so over the top gory that it's kinda ridiculous. I feel like the grittiness is gone. Don't get me wrong, the gore is still gross, it's just more silly now. Like I said, the finishing moves are so unrealistic BUT I am still gonna rate this 18+ for just the amount violence.
The content in this game is very violent which is the basis of every game in the series except Mk vs dc universe. The violence is extremely bloody and gory to the point where it could be sickening for some and shocking/scary. The most violent parts in this game are called fatalities which usually occur after the opponent has been beaten and will do an animation where they look dizzy, and if you put an a curtain input of buttons you will do a fatality which is blood and gore city, such as skin being ripped off hearts exploding being kicked in the mans parts hard enough to make the entire skeleton fly out of the body. Some parts of the fatalities are meant for laughs because the are so exaggerated. The story is full of great role models who do anything for the people they care for and the people who need it. The story is really well done and all the characters are at least pretty likable. The plot has some holes in it but barely any of note. The sex is not like Mortal Kombat 9 at all, I mean there is no sex but female characters where some pretty iffy outfits. The male outfits are basically shirtless
