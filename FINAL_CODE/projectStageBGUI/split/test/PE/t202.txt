 game!
Great
Spooky fun
Boo!
It may be scary, but on my opinion it's not. I think some of it's cheery actually. Luigi is very brave fighting all those ghosts.I love how it can be 2 player when you unlock Gooigi. The hotel owner is a bit scary and I find her voice frightening , but apart from that , it's not scary! I watch YouTube Videos about this to get by levels , but I do most of it on my own. It's hard, but it's easy to play so I'd say it's 6 plus.It's so good , but some of the ghosts are impossible to destroy. It took me months to Destroy the Mozart ghost. Hard , but easy to play.
This game is really fun. Great story, and lots of challenging puzzles. Unfortunately, younger kids who get the game are going to have a hard time. The puzzles are quite challenging, and some of the bosses are near impossible. Also, if you have old controllers, it is hard to change into Gooigi. Even at my age, the final bosses are still near impossible. Even though it is hard, this game is still a treasure. The ghosts are not scary, but certain scenes, and the mansion itself has a spooky atmosphere. Have fun playing!
The bosses are fun its not scary AND POLTERPUP IS SO GOSH DARN CUTE
This game has hardly any scariness you can do puzzles that are challenging,hard bosses,and it can take up to 20 hours to beat maybe more if your child isn’t very good at puzzles.Very creative game better than the Luigi’s mansion game cube!
A good solid game my 6 year old brother loves it!
In this game, you must save your friends from a haunted hotel. It's really fun, and only has cartoon violence. It has nothing inappropriate in it, and is fun for the whole family.
The game is scary but it has really good messages and role models.
I really want to play this game. This Christmas am asking for a Nintendo switch and a couple games I hope one of those games are Luigi's mansion 3
Luigi's mansion is a light hearted &amp; funny "horror game". While the game is a direct follow up to the previous entries there not really important besides for some character's and such. There are some occasional jump scares from cartoony green ghosts and the game can be a bit complicated at times but it's still fun. This game adds two player so you can play along side your kid as 'Goo-igi', a luigi made of goo.
Like your video little kids believe in what they see so i agree
Its a good game
A game about Vampires, there's obviously gonna be blood, but in this game you can sort of pick a side between, coming a good or bad vampire (whether you drink from civilians or not). Some scenes can be frightening for young kids that's why I wouldn't recommend under 13's to play this game,
Super Monkey Ball is a blast!!!
