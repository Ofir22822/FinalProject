 the whole campaign!(the campaign is extremely long). Most of the language used is goddamn and s**t. The language is about 5/10. Video games with a similar level of language is Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and Marvel's Avengers, and Battlefield 1. Sex: you interrupt a couple having sex on accident(may not happen but is not up to you), nothing sensitive is shown. Sex is not present overall. Alcohol is a big issue, characters smoke and get drunk constantly. Alcohol is 6/10. An example of this high level of drinking and smoking would be Batman Arkham Knight. Overall the age rating for me would be(PEGI 16/TEEN). If this game was a movie it would be 12a(America: PG-13). Don't get this game for your 13-year-old if you feel that they are a bit reckless and need to learn the value of human life. Thank you.
I first should warn parents to keep anyone under 18 away from this game due to the pervasiveness of certain elements like coarse bad language and some violent disturbing scenes which mostly occur in the cutscenes between gameplay. Some missions in the game, even when the player is trying to do them for high honor will still involve killing people. And sometimes killing a certain character such as in bounty hunting missions will still yield good honor although usually not as much as taking them alive. Or killing a character who is considered too evil to be kept alive. As a counselor I simply don't believe that even truly evil people should have to die for their bad deeds. What sets this game apart from others such as GTA however is that there is a good and bad honor system which increases positively when the player makes the right choices and refrains from committing crimes. Or will decrease when the player steals, kills people or commits other criminal activity. the high honor seems to give greater rewards than negative honor and it affects the ending as well. this is the only reason why I would even begin to consider allowing any young adult to play. It gives the option to work honestly for something you want instead of always stealing and killing for it like GTA which only rewards these negative choices and actions. Be aware however that many who play will still be tempted in the game to do the wrong things and cause trouble and you may have to enforce your point and check their honor status to make sure they are following the conditions to play the game. You may even have to play it with them until they can be trusted alone. Rules are Bad honor- game off. Good honor- game on. this in turn will keep the player from mercilessly rampaging, killing and torturing many innocent NPC's in the game and stealing which makes it far less violent. Otherwise it is quite possible to do some extremely heinous and cruel inhuman things. I even think I heard you can skin people and lynch them. I've
