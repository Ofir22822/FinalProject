 the Call of Duty franchise. It portrays deep realism and also some of the harshest aspects of modern combat. Marines have said that this is the most realistic video game ever. This game has a very compelling campaign that has a lot of heroism that demonstrates the bravery of our veterans. I would say if you’re over 13, you can thoroughly enjoy this game. Although it’s much worse in real life, this game does have some rough language and of course some blood, as it is realistic to real life. I’d also rate it this high because it really plays with your heart, you have to make very tough choices in combat. You have to choose who’s life to spare and who’s to take. In one mission, you find a house we’re half are hostages and half are terrorists. The hostages and terrorists are very difficult to tell between. You must choose when to shoot and when to hold your fire. It does make you feel bad when you accidentally take out an innocent. Overall, this is a great game but you have to be wise in what you put in your mind at what age, I’m a Christian and this game didn’t hurt my relationship with God, I hope you enjoyed this review and that it helps you make your decision.
This game is great for kids like me who just want to have fun with their friends. altho this game has a few aspects it is a great game to buy your kid. (sorry for my spelling) it does have blood and gore but can be eaisly turned off in the settings. please get this game for your kid if they want it.
I play this game often, and I think it is amazing. It depicts the world of what our modern-day soldiers have to go through. However, it has alot, and I mean, alot, of violence. It isn't suitable for kids under 12, due to the graphic nature of both the campaign and multiplayer.
Call of duty modern warfare is a very standard call of duty game with normal amounts of violence, very softcore gore and blood, and a decent amount of cussing. Now the thing about this game is the campaign. In the campaign you deal with things such as proxy wars, terrorism, and chemical warfare. There are a lot of mature levels in it such as one where a car bomb goes off in Piccadilly square, and one where you have to clear out a house containing innocent people. It's a very well done campaign but just might be a bit to mature for younger children. Other than that it's a pretty great game, the multiplayer itself is fine for most ages and its just really fun. As always it depends on the child and how mature he or she is.
anyone can play this game as long as they're mature enough. your kid will hear much much worse language in school. teens and tweens are generally extremely nasty
