 You won’t see anything bad in that scene though, you just have a gas mask on and end up passing out. I think the game holds a very good message, that the governments in the US and UK are trying to take down a terror organization and restore peace to the country of Urzikstan.
I would like to begin by saying there are several good reviews out there, but also many which are quite biased and not necessarily accurate. Call of Duty's latest Modern Warfare has the 18+ age rating for a reason; an obscene amount of violence and horrors of war, such as civilians being shot and killed, children fatalities, terrorist attacks, etc. I highly respect this age rating, but also believe that teens, at the very least should be at least 15 years old. Although I would say there could be exceptions for children who are more mature and understand the whole concept of true war, for someone who understands this myself finds that the age of 15 is the minimum for this game. This is mostly due to the campaign feature of the game. (The campaign is the part with most traits of war, like the terrorist attacks, civilians, gore, etc.) As for the multiplayer, it is a much more fast paced and less blood and gore is involved. Mainly firing weapons at other players. The game, however has great messages, as well as great role models. One of which I find, is a female character who fights against the oppression of her people. There are also good themes one can take from the campaign. Overall, I would say that the campaign is for mature teens at least the age of 15, and the multiplayer could probably be around the 13-14+ age.
I think that CoD: Modern Warfare is a game meant for 13 year olds or up. I play mostly Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield 1 and if you let your kids play those games they will be fine playing this game. It does show people smoking but it never supports it. It does have a large amount of violence but you can turn of blood and language. The worst part (in terms of violence) Is the campaign but for the most part that is fine too. Just a few levels are too violent. It is a realistic, down to earth, gritty approach to the genera and shows the rolls of counter terrorism and police in today's conflicts. And an added bonus: It is so much better than Fortnite.
The game is an FPS and mainly is violence. There are a bit of f bombs in campaign. The worst thing u can really experience in voice chat is toxic sweats which are mostly 15+. Though you can just mute them. But if ur child is 11 and mature and wants the game, go ahead and buy it for them.
It’s educational
I think you should get this for a 10 year old if there looking to play the campaign then maybe
