 that this should be rated E10+ rather than T. For some reason, CMS says that character dismememberment is in this game, when a character dies there is NO dismemberment (except for the ROBOTIC character, Bastion). Also, over half of the roster doesn't have guns (not counting laser guns as a gun). There is extremely little blood that is rarely seen. This game also isn't like a normal FPS game that's extremely dark. The overall vibe of the game is about heroism. And the graphics are in an animated Pixar style. This game has no sex, and no drugs or alcohol. One character smokes a cigar, though. I would highly recommend this game to any family with children 10 or over.
First of, lets get something out the way, by no means is this game stereotypical or sexist. Yes, some women have revealing outfits, but the same could be said for some of the men. You could say the characters use "drugs" to heal themselves which even saying that is over exaggerating. And literally there is no blood or gore just a few bullets so the violence is low to a mature standard. Now the ACTUAL game, its excellent. While sometimes it gets a little bit repetetive, the character and feel-good vibe with the bright map design could keep you addicted for hours. Also, teamwork and skill is a LARGE part of this game so young children might learn a thing or two. Over all, Its brilliant. Go out and buy it RIGHT NOW.
Overwatch is a very solid game, really fun and easy to play. It is an FPS with guns but there isn't any blood and the guns look really futuristic and more cool than violent. Nothing wrong with this game at all. As long as you know how to play as a team and with good strategy this is great.
If this isn't kid friendly, i dont know what is. One of the characters is a hamster from the moon. And for the alleged "tobacco usage", it's one character (also, is there a kid who doesn't know that you shouldn't smoke by now?). Ninjas, cowboys, robots, more robots, what's not to like? The violence and shooting is very mild. Most don't even use bullets, it's usually just lasers. Blood? Please. Other than a red outline of the screen when you're hit, there's nothing. Players just go ragdoll when they die. No gore or anything. It's also not very realistic. Almost every aspect is cartoony. It also teaches strategy, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time. The conflict is also good guys vs. bad guys. like anything, really. This is a great game for kids and literally anybody. (P.s.: if you dont want voice chat, just turn it off.)
Great game you can get rid of the cigar and no sex is in it. Very little blood if it did not say it on the rating would not know it was their.
Common sense media has rated this too high once again. Parents, ignore the comment
