 title good for teens 14 and up
Unlike the rest of the fallout franchise they FINALLY removed NPC's! I now have next to no interaction in the game because nobody likes me, unlike elder scrolls online which sucks because it has NPC's
I think people 12 and over can play Fallout 76 as you need to work as a team to survive but is quite vulgar and gory that should not be a huge problem though it is not as gory as previous fallout games
This Game Is Good -Fat Abbot- 2019
You can turn off the blood so it is not violent plus over all it is not much difference to skyrim
They've fixed a lot of the bugs and added in a battle royal mode. The community is nice, the game is entertaining, and it's worth checking out if you haven't already. It's definitely worth it. I am level 70 (In Adventure mode) at the moment, but I know people who are level 200+. They're constantly adding updates and stuff to the shop to keep the game fun, this isn't a game that you just beat and put back on your shelf.
I have played this game and think it fine for anyone mature enough to handle slight blood and occasional cursing. My kids have heard much worse at school and sports so why not let them play a fun strategic video game when they hear worse daily?
This game has some graphic detail, not much though, it also great gameplay and should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 12. It's not as violent as they say. I watched my 2 kids play this game, they had fun interactin g with the game and I have to say it did look good!
I thought when this game was first announced that it be great, but BOI was I wrong. Bethesda should be ashamed of their greedy selfs and quit being game developers. This game is buggy and unfinished, its like they only did it for the money. SKIP THIS TRASH
There are beliefs that there is prostitution in this game that is far from the truth to be honest it’s not that bad it just has weird looking creatures because it was set after the apocalypse.
Fallout 76
Not as bad as you would think for your child
Buggy...
Violent, and frankly not worth your money
Fun for the Whole Family
Lol
Not too bad
Not as many bad words as it says
I am a jewish father who believes that games are not good until inspected and reviewed. Fallout 76 is almost like watching a pg13 movie i think that the games curses are minimal and can be cut out it is a shooting game so there is a decent amount of blood but on a 1 to 10 ratio i rate it a 7in violence and gore on the scale of a pg13 movie more or less i suggest you filter out bad language. their is no nudity or sex so i suggest to other parents buying this gift for chanuckah to
