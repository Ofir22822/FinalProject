 is a great role model because of his courage and determination, when playing as heavy characters such as roadhog, d.va, etc, there will be very little but some blood, easy controls, McCree often has a cigar hanging from his lip which can be impressionable to younger players. some characters such as d.va, mercy, and widowmaker, often show off their looks (no full nudity is shown, no sex scenes). Every once in a while someone will try to lag/hack the map, it only makes the map lag a lot. Other than these reasons overwatch players are good to go.

Overwatch is great for anyone, really. The reason i've rated it for kids 10 and up is because if you turn on the voice chat, there can be other people speaking and it is unmoderated, meaning that there could be swear words jumping around. However, there is an option to turn off voice chat in the settings, in which case i'd say that anyone can play it if they are able to, basically. There is hardly any violence at all, and it's a very fun game to play. I have no idea why it's given 4/5 for consumerism in the review. I guess there is one character who holds a cigar. That's all I can think of. The game emanates a positive message of hope, justice and heroism. The main face of the game, Tracer's main voice line is "The world could always use more heroes!". That's basically what the game is about. Heroes, and saving the world. On YouTube you can find character backstories about how the Overwatch characters came to be. I'd recommend watching them; they're very entertaining and show what Overwatch is about.
Short answer: -Light atmosphere -Gun/melee weapon violence -Briefly appearing blood -Mild language -Somewhat revealing unlockable outfits -Chat system with a filter that can be turned off, or completely unfiltered voice chat -One character with a cigar, alcohol reference Overall, some things to be aware of, but definitely better than the popular M rated games. Detailed answer: Overwatch is a fast-paced, team-based shooter game. With its bright colors and light atmosphere, the game is much more family friendly than almost any other first-person shooter on the market. The game has some violence, but nothing particularly intense. It could include shooting a gun, hitting someone with a hammer, or hitting someone with your gun. When a character takes damage, a brief splash of blood appears, then in a fraction of a second, will disappear. No gore whatsoever. Some characters have lines every now and then that include mild language. (This also happens when nearly any character receives the Orb of Discord.) Still, definitely preferable to most other shooters. As the game progresses, you can unlock changes to the character's outfits, some of which reveal the stomach- but no privates. (D.va, Symmetra, and Tracer fall under this category.) The gaming community is infamous for being very foul-mouthed. If your team is losing, you will almost certainly hear profanity over the
