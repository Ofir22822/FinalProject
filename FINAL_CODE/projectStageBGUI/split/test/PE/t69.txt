 My child and I loved this game And while there is a lot of swearing and violence, if your kid can filter it and is not easily scared then this is a good game
For the most part it is a great game but there is one area in the game that triggers a cinematic cutscene involving numerous female characters without clothing covering their upper bodies. The females are in the frame for maybe 30 seconds and aren’t seen afterwards.
The Textorcist: A Better Review
The Textorcist while Rife with what is obviously seen, blood, violence, heavily implied sex, obvious swearing, alcoholism. THE STORY, (as some people seem to be unable to recall EXISTS in the world today) Is simply put, a fallen priest who has true faith in god, on a mission to exorcise demons from our world. His name is Ray Bibbia, he has a history of violence and a gritty, dark demeanor, however as we follow his story, we find his faith renewed as he takes a pitfall from learning that he cannot kill demons to save his daughter, to redeeming himself by reconnecting with with his mentor from 20 years to find a way that he can. While Ray is not the EXCEEDINGLY great role model, doesn't everyone deserve a second chance to redeem themselves?
Tetris 99
Please read my review
Almost exactly like the original game Tetris but with in game purchases and on a screen...
I have rated this game 8 and up because of difficulty of play. There is no violence or bad language in this game, plus it is a free game so why not let your kid play it?
yee hay
hello again Yo kai watch 3 is a very great game with ease of play and good times for all but my ONLY warning the game uses the word hellish but if you are fine with swearing its a great game overall and you can get over powered "yo kai" by playing busters T where weaker players can get powerful yo kai from the start! and its a great game and is not one to miss! also there is discolored blood (witch is green) but over all its good!
The plot is the best part
While there are some dark tones, overall I believe the story encompasses hope and being a good person. There are some minor things, like some hyper sexual characters but overall it’s not super put in your face.
Better than fortnight as no silly dancing
Cartoonish Battle Royale similar to Overwatch

Kids over nine years old can play apex lengends (my opinion)

Not At All Violent, the most Popular Game on the Market!
Apex legends is not actually that violent
Has a little violence, but not tons
Great game with safe chat so it will never be unsafe
Similar to Fortnite

Non-Toxic Fun..for now
More realistic than Fortnite, requires a bit more teamwork, Not overly violent though.
Completely fine
Common sense is wrong!
