 PC (sorry console gamers).
Very good game for kids who are in their college years, here are the reasons for why I think this should be the rating: Blood, violent scenes, mild gambling and online features.
I was at first hesitant at letting my 10 year old playing but I have realized that the game is not at all realistic a little bit of blood and no gore the game is not addictive unlike fortnite a much bitter less addictive game than fortnite
I’m fortnite, you can do hundreds of emotes to taunt other players. Also, Fortnite is copying everything from this game. Apex is a great game for kids 6+ if they are mature.
Great for teamwork. Definitely wouldn’t let anyone under age 10 play or watch, but a mature 10 year old could easily play this.
brilliant
This game has a lot of teamwork and helping other people
I’m guessing that there are some reviews on here where people are joking ? 3/5/7 year olds playing a game that’s been rated a 16 ? Screenagers really helps with looking at the psychological and brain development issues that arise from gaming.
The reason why I played this game so far similar to other Battle Royale games. This game contains mild blood, mild language and moderate violence, Players can interact their squads in gameplay and this game may experience online play. Using voice chat can swear other players including addiction to games. The profanity word H*ll and D**n can be heard in the dialogue with some characters of the game.
Most of the players are like 14+ and it fine but most 14 year olds are not that mature so 15 is good. (16+ recommended). There’s blood and looks realistic. But what really concerned me was the voice chat. There is a whole lot of toxic teens Swearing. And the voice chat is not that easy to disable. TIP: So if your kid plays it, be close to them and when they start a match don’t make them have headphones on or mute the volume until in the plane. Click (I) on pc or whatever on button to open inventory on the controller, on the top of there will be Three tabs; Inventory, squads, legend. Click squads and at the bottom of each player there will be a speaker click it to mute. But I still do not recommend kids under 12 to play
This game is so fun for my 7 year old son to play. He loves it and plays it daily. I only let him have 3 hours of screentime a day, and he spends all of it on Apex. There is a tiny bit of violence in this game, but it 100% promotes teamwork. I love this game and would let any elementary school student play it.
Apex legends is a great game, but it does have a lot of violence. If you are a a parent and you are okay with your kid playing a first person shooter that has blood and guns, well let your
