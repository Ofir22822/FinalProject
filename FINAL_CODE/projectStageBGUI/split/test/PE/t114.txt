 year old son seems to really like this game. As a game, it's fine and I don't have any concerns. However, I do not like that there is an in-game chat (text, not voice). Players are able to use inappropriate language in their username or in the chat.
A fun game that allows you to introduce your kid to your childhood
VERY FUN GAME!
No more gambling
Disturbing: What's with the "you're hot" comments???
Parents need to chill...
I was about twelve when Pokemon Red and Blue came out, and I remember I really loved it. I saw that there was a new rerelease of that classic game, so without thinking, I plopped the $100 edition in the cart for my daughter (and me as well). When we got home, we revved it up and started playing. It’s pretty fun, and I’m not sure if it’s just because I’ve gotten older, but it seemed pretty easy. They took away the battles against wild Pokemon, and replaced them with something similar to Pokemon Go’s system. Everything was alright until we got to Misty’s gym. The people there were a little scantily clad imo, but it’s fine for the most part. It remained a cute game, until we got to Celedon City. They took away the damn slot machines. I remember really enjoying that, but I guess it’s fine. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is Lavender Town. Anyone who played the originals growing up remembers this place. The creepy atmosphere is jarring, and the somber tone of the story there is really out of place. I wish they had made it less scary, like they did in Gold and Silver. The story with the Cubone made my daughter cry. I couldn’t help but remember all the scary stories I heard about it on the playground when the originals came out, so I fear what my daughter will hear. Googling scary Pokemon stories gives a lot of graphic results, so I’m worried about that. Overall, this was a fun time. I got to relive my childhood, and introduce a new memory to my daughter. I will definitely be picking up the next one.
JANE, ERIK AND I ARE ALWAYS PLAYING THIS GAME TOGETHER! IT IS VERY GOOD! TEACHES GOOD CHRISTIAN VALUES! MANY CUTE PETS TO CATCH! IT'S A GOOD GAME! NO SEX! NO SATANIC LANGUAGE! JUST GOOD OLD PEOPLE AND POKEMON! THERE ARE A LITTLE TOO MANY FIGHTS, I THINK. IT COULD DO WITH A CONVERSATION MODE. THAT WOULD BE FUN! THOUGH, I LIKE THE LACK OF THE WORD "KILL". IT INSTEAD MAKES POKEMON "FAINT" WHICH IS BETTER!
Pok?mon yellow is rated for 12+ but let's go removed the gambling
My kiddo is 8... and some of the content seems "not age appropriate"... Example: what's with the "you're hot" comment one of the characters makes to the trainer that is my kiddo's character? Anybody else experienced these weird statements? I'll change my rating and age appropriateness as soon as I get an answer to this.
That one reviewer is overreacting. Fire
