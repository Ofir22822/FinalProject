 worth noting is a scene in which a character has to cut off his finger. He grabs his little finger with pliers, and after a long build-up, slams his fist down on them, crushing and cutting his finger off(the impact is felt, but not shown). In summary, great game for mature audiences.
Heavy rain mixes both Violence and sex into the game. Much like God of war. But this has a lot of sexual content. Someone forced to strip at gunpoint and topless women. The more the merrier. The violence is a bit high but its no more than you'd see on an average CSI:Miami program. The language isn't too bad at all. Its not that bad, The sex isn't as bad as said but it still lingers.

They call it an "interactive drama". The game tells the story of tracking down the Origami Killer from the perspective of four different people. I really shouldn't say more because I would spoil it. The gameplay consists of you pressing the buttons on screen and making the motions that the game tells you to. The story can branch off into multiple directions based on what your actions are. One or multiple characters could potentially die and they are gone from the rest of the game. The game does have a few sex scenes and one nude scene of a
