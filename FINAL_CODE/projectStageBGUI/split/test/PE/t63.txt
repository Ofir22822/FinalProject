 I think it’s a great game, that everyone, and I mean everyone over the age of 13 should play.
Bloody fantasy violence for teens.
Could be better....
Very disappointing!
This game was very disappointing . The story line is boring, the amount of content isn't too much, overall not that great. Cleavage is shown but too much, and the violence is slightly raised from doa5. the DLC isn't all that cool (Mai was in doa5 so nothing new, and Kula is interesting but doesn't really fit that much in the game in my opnion). Then again the game is fan service and wasn't really made to be played very competitively. The costumes are very expensive, and the extra things that "offer a better experience" are way to much. doa5 was much, much better. I would only recommend the game to people who can spend lots of money and who are new to the series. Besides that the gameplay is similar to previous titles. However, there is a chance team ninja and Tecmo will release a remake of the game making it better like they did with doa5.
I see that no one has bothered to review this game yet, so I thought I'd add in my two cents. So let me just start off by saying that this game is a joke, a waste of time, energy and console space. I can't believe after all the content that DOA5 had, even in the base game, that this is all Team Ninja could come up with. This game is just insulting. I can't believe that the base game here is so pointless and wasteful. It's complete garbage that they make charge you almost $100 for a season pass, with season pass exclusives that are just pointless costumes, a bunch of other meaningless costumes with each pack very expensive themselves, and like, two third-party characters (Mai Shiranui and Kula Diamond), who don't even come with their own stage! Why not?! Smash does it! Tekken does it! Soul Calibur does it! I'm really amazed that CSM didn't give this 5 bubbles for Consumerism, because this game has a ridiculous amount of pointless of costumes with very few new characters and one new stage, with even more pointless costumes and another new character on the way so far, all that are very expensive. Now to get into the game itself, the only reason I gave this two stars is because of the graphical improvement and gameplay, other than that it pretty much sucks. Over half of the story mode is just Nico doing something in her lab or those two derpy schoolgirls Honoka and Marie Rose being annoying. Every other character barely has a story at all. Their new character Diego is just some retarded Jersey Shore guy who also annoys me. DOA Quest is very repetitive because they're all just rival battles. Jann Lee fighting Leifang again? Sure didn't see that coming! The stage selection is the worst part of this whole game. They're all just basic ideas
