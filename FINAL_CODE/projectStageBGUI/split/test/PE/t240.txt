 played by younger audiences when they should be!
This is the most kid friendly FPS I've ever played. There is no sexual content or swearing. The violence is NOTHING compared to a 12+ movie and I think a 10 year old of average maturity should be fine with this game. There is virtually no blood and if parents are concerned about the shooting, you are playing as the good guy fighting the bad guy and it doesn't look very realistic. Also most of the time you are fighting against cartoony robots not real people. The game is actually very cartoony and doesn't look real at all. The game also helps with your child's team building skills and reaction times. If your child is over 10 or 11 parents should have nothing to worry about, it's NOWHERE near as violent as most 12+ movies and overall a kid-teen friendly game, so this is a great gift for ages 10 and over.
Okay, before we start, I have been playing OverWatch since launch. I currently sit in the diamond rank which people believe to be the most toxic. Yes, there is a bad egg or two, but there is no reason that this game should be given a rating like CSM did. The game includes many things to get rid of them. The game allows you to avoid people, so you don’t end up in their voice chat and there is the option of leaving a voice channel and muting them. The game includes no drugs, unless you think a cowboy with a cigar is worthy of a drug rating. He’s also smoking a normal cigar, not weed or crack. No sex in the game, to be honest nothing bad at all. Would highly recommend
This game is really fun and not very inappropriate ... UNTIL you turn on voice chat, people are either extremely toxic(mean) or say stupid stuff. Some of the outfits are slightly revealing but who cares, it's not that bad. There also isn't a lot of blood and for some reason some of the time the characters yell out "d*mn" but not very frequently. **Avoid competitive if you play on PC because the ranking system is really bad and even if you are really good you'll stay in Gold or below unless you are a pro. It's just toxic and rage inducing, no one should have to go through it kid or adult, just stick to arcade and quick play unless you are a pro***
Listen, listen. As a video game connoisseur i think I have the right to speak on the matter on this game. Children are gullible, I know, I shouldn’t be saying it. But the fact of the matter is this is the most family friendly shooter game ever made. I got this game at the age of ten, and I will never forget some of the incredibly nice people on this game. Sure, there are some “toxic” gamers who play Overwatch, however, they are generally nice once you
