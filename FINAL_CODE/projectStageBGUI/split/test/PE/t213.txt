 that can be turned off by turning dialogue off and there can be dismemberment with some weapons, but that can be turned too, meaning players can only see a small cloud of blood. Multiplayer is only 12+ with these off. Hope this helped :)
This game is incredible but there are also lots of bloody moments like finishing moves. there is swearing but mostly in the campaign. Sometimes there are toxic players you know how it is but honestly it should not be 18+. I started when I was 12 but I never got addicted. It's fun but you need to play multiple game modes to get the best experience
First the reviews on this game are Karen’s that don’t care what real reviewers say in the campaign yes pretty violent But the multiplayer is fine you can barley see the blood and it won’t “Make your kids terroists!” They are exatterateing so if your kid really wants the game just give it. And if someone swears you can all ways mute them plus most parents writing the reviews haven’t played The game.
I raged alot many times when i played Warzone, but i just want to get better at this game better than me rage quitting on my own XBOX One.
Well, common sense lied in some parts. The video all happens but you can turn off anything that can actually scar your kid or make them act violent. I’ve played it so I should know.
I think it should be 11 plus there is blood, guns and a little bit torture and healing injections and it’s basically based on what army personnel go throughout and my dad lets me play it. You can go into the setting and turn off blood
Ok, I know that it says there is sex and really, I've seen no kissing, no in the bed stuff and none of that. It would be fine but pretty violent. That was for campaign, the story part. I recommend doing that so your child doesn't have to spend money on extra characters. It gives you some free. The story has a lot of swearing, but no racial slurs of any kind. Next, the multiplayer mode. You can talk with random people, but you can mute yourself and mute everyone else. If you are in a PS4 or Xbox party, it will usually.only let you talk to party members or friends in the party. Also, forgot 1 thing. In story mode, there is one character that smokes cigars and his name is Captain Price. On to Warzone, the battle royale map in Verdansk, russia . This I'snt as bad as the other modes, as you can do a setting where you don't put random people in your team. You cannot talk with anyone but your team. That's about it
This is a fun game with a fun online! However this game has a campaign with Profanity, Gore (Can be filterd), and mature topics... This game has lots of filters you can turn off characters
