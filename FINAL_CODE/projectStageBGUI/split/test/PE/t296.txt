 do if you want to win. There are many team roles in this game, and many seem to ignore it, but it's a huge part of this game. It teaches many that if you don't have a good person filling that niche, it can easily fall apart without coordination. You don't even need aim to play this game at all, in fact, you can play several other heroes that can help you as a crutch and STILL be useful. There's high skill ceilings and floors for many heroes, and it will take awhile to master many of them. The major part of this is that in order to really experience the game at the height of what it is, is to play as much as you can. The game constantly puts out new events and releases fresh content that anyone would love. On the topic of the characters, they're great in design and backstory. Every character has something that many can identify with, and will have a great time playing as in the world of Overwatch. I'm a teen, and I play a lot of competitive Overwatch. I wouldn't recommend slapping your 8 year old child into a game who thinks he runs the town by playing a shoddy sniper. It ruins the experience for everyone. Do the community a favor and mature before you play the game.
I think this is a great game. No blood. Very fun I started when I was 10 years. Not voilance at all please belive I think if you asked most people that they would say yes or some say no but it hasn't efficted me at all verey good
Just because there are no explicit swearing heard usually,and the characters are drawn in a Pixar art style and have awesome futuristic weapons which are designed to not be too violent for a standard first person shooter game.And also there is no blood or visible gore in this game just like they have no sex or sexual themes.There are positive role models,but the most clear as crystal moments are for Tracer,Winston,Mei and some heroes you may refer to as role models such as Mercy. And also if there is the chat mode turned on...the game will be far from kid friendly because of vulgar and insulting comments that sound like the ones you heard from cyberbullying.

There was no sex nor sexual references at all throughout the game with no drugs whatsoever unless you include one character who smokes. Otherwise it is a great game which anyone can enjoy, kids and parents alike. However, some of the language people use on the chats can be rude and sometimes mean, I usually only play with friends or AI.
great game for kids above ten and also is cartoony pics won't see any blood so very good for violence games
I have played this game for a while, and you learn that teamwork is the
