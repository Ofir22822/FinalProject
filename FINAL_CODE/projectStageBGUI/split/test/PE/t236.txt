 It's fun and entertaining but not the best. Luckily this game has multiplayer, which is where it shines. Lots of similar gamemodes make a return, and since new ones arrive. Like always, it's a very unique and entertaining experience. The game is missing features that were critical in previous games, like character variations. Age Review: It's not the best the series has been but it's worth grabbing on sale. You play as a plant or zombie, and you fight. No "actual" guns but it's still a shooter. The game has zombies in it but they're not scary in any way. They are in fact humours. Little to no violence, no language, and no sex. Recommended for ages 5+
