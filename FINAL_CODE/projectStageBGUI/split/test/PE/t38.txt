 Its a awful game
Rated 15 (sustained threat, psychological horror, violence, strong language).
Its not appropriate for kids what so ever its disgusting an revolting as u beat the life out of creatures and the gameplay is not enjoyable and is just plain broken its not scary its just sick and not in a good way
SEX/NUDITY - None. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are scenes of disturbing horror violence as the player fights grotesque creatures with a variety of weapons. However, these scenes lack the goriest and most graphic detail due to the top-down camera angle and art style. There are also some bloody images and implications of violent incidents. PROFANITY - There is some strong language ("f*ck"), as well as instances of milder terms. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There are plenty of drug references and alcohol references throughout, both visual and verbal. The player is also encouraged to create medicinal drugs for health boosts etc. Although, these are never or rarely used in recreational or stimulating ways, and the game as a whole does not encourage drugs in the real world. THREAT/HORROR - The game contains a constant, sustained sense of threat and menace, made more unsettling and disturbing by the psychological horror elements throughout gameplay. Although being relatively low on explicit gory images, this is still a very intense and surreal experience, with frequent frightening moments which might cause upset to people of a nervous disposition. 15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.
A surprisingly great package!
It includes Bloodlines? Awesomesauce!
After the release of the latest Super Smash Bros, some might ask, "Who is this Simon character?" Now, they can experience the adventures of Simon Belmont and his family in this new collection. While the controls are simple, these games are known for their high difficulty. Luckily, there is a save feature that allows players to save at a hard part in the game and load it again if they mess up. I would recommend newcomers to start off with the fourth game, as it is much more balanced in terms of difficulty. As for inappropriate content, there are some blood and plenty of scary monsters, some being topless women, but nothing too graphic. I highly recommend this collection, as it contains some of the best games ever made!
All the core titles up until Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night (which are best experienced in the Dracula X Chronicles collection on PSP) makes this a good deal. Also, Simon's Quest is rather notorious for a number of quirks (as a certain Mr. Rolfe explained at length) and people might want to look up one of the rom-hacks that correct the issues for a more enjoyable experience. Being based on classic monster movies, there's plenty of horror elements that might disturb kids, even in pixelated form. And the often-overlooked Bloodlines includes actual historical references (World War I, Elizabeth Bathory) that might be awkward for
