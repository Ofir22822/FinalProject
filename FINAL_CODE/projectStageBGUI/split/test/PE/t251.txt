BEST COD!!!!!
Pretty good campaign.
Absolutely NOT for Children
This is a great game and the age rating is way too high it is fine for any young teens and up although maybe for 10-12 year olds don't let them play the campaign but apart from that it is a very good game for most ages
It is not as bad as they say. geez give it a rest.my son loves it and it does have good role models. Parents this better than fortnite for your 12-15 son ( or daughter) to play.
The campaign is showing war. It is toned down and stylelzed a bit but you still see body's burn, you have to use a mom and a son in a part to get info,you have to shoot woman and men, and etc. It seems like many kids are saying 10+ and that's not true. Mutilplayer is definitely less bloody and Gorey but I wouldn't recommend it for kids. Over all this game is ment to touch on some of war and show some of it's dark sides. Your kid if they are 15-16+ probably know this by now and could probably find real pictures and videos of it online if they wanted to. But for the love of all things holy and good do not like a 10 year old play this game! Let them play something else not this.
Wow
This game shouldn’t be an 18 sure the campaign is a bit brutal but 18!!!!!! If I were you I wouldn’t let your kid play the campaign but let them play all the other game modes which are multiplayer and spec ops
its a great game and not violent if you turn off the blood and swearing setting it was great for my kids
I let my nine year old play this and he absolutely loved it, along with me!
Great
I’m 23, grown up with these games. Started playing around 12-13. Probably a good age to start. This games’ multiplayer I could knock down to 11. It’s just moderate violence and moderate blood. I don’t think any tween with sound mental health would be effected by it. The campaign however... one of the most graphic. One level in particular you are given a high powered sniper rifle and it can realistically shoot off the limbs and heads of enemies. Small children and tweens for sure will be disturbed by this. Otherwise a great game!
I'm letting anyone know right now. DO NOT LET CHILREN PLAY THIS!!! It's absolutely not suitable for anyone under the age of 17/18+. Hell in my opinion it seems more like for 20 and up. At first I thought it wasn't going to be this bad but then I had to see it for myself just
