 other words, there are no 'wounds' made visible on your enemy after attacking them. This blood effect can be turned to 'light' (which makes the blood appear green instead of red) or turned off completely. The blood is implemented in such a way that it really makes no difference if it is present or not. If it was turned off in my game without my knowledge, I most likely wouldn't even notice. -The subject matter is of a dark, dismal, sorrowful and morbid nature. The themes are most likely above the heads of small children. This game is most likely not for young children. Not because of the violence but because of the difficulty and dark nature. It will be especially difficult for someone who has never played a game in this series. There are no prompts or indicators of what you are supposed do or where you are supposed to go, other than vague dialog from various characters and item descriptions. In fact, outside of item descriptions, the story or plot is all but nonexistent. The character building and leveling of character and weapons would be difficult for a young child to figure out. There are no instructions explaining it either. The game would be more frustrating for a young child than disturbing. There is also online multiplayer. It can be either cooperative or competitive. There is a system that allows you to meet up and play with specific people, like your friends. But for the most part, online interactions are anonymous and random. A frustrated player, barely making through will likely get invaded and killed by a more experienced player. These experienced players can spot a newbie and often like to toy with them. I would imagine this would be even more frustrating than the game is already. If you die, you lose everything (collected souls and humanity, which are forms of currency) and have to start from the beginning of the level (last bonfire rested at) unless you can make it back to your blood stain (the place at which you were killed) without getting killed again. I would say a (mature)12 years old and up. Again, not really because of violence or subject matter but because of difficulty, ambiguous goals and story, and level of patience required. A young child, under 12years old, would most likely be either bored or frustrated. The game will severely punish players who are impatient and run into situations swinging their sword. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest games and series of games ever made. They have ruined me for all other games. If a new game comes out that interests me, (which is rare) I will play it for a couple weeks and then go right back to Dark Souls and the related games in the series.
The 60 FPS is good addition. Especially a game as precise as this. Too pricy tho. Other than remaining glitches that its the same uber-tough 3D Metrovania/ARPG fun for new fans.
