Normal violence
As another reviewer says if they already now about it should be fine. If your child is ok when it comes to violence it’s a great game!
Same old teen drama stuff, if you’re kid knows about I think they are fine playing it to be honest
Quite a bit of violence but not inappropriate
There is very occassional use of strong language, and a couple of sex scenes with very limited nudity. Other than that, this is basically very similar to a superhero movie or TV show. It touches on some difficult themes and issues such as bullying, homelessness, and CIA's covert military operations, which your kids may not understand or even pick up on. But it certainly isn't unsuitable for them to play it.
You should never let your kids under 18+ play this rated M (Mature) for 17 and up like me. I can play it because I'm a adult. 21 years of age. So, I admit in you not allowing your kids that are under the age of 21 and up. Beyond Two Souls does have cussing in like fu** and Sh** and bit**.
As an experience, Beyond: Two Souls is an intense and dramatic ride where you will laugh, cry, and mostly cry. But as a game, the challenge falls short- wait a second, that's right, there is none. Seriously, I'm pretty sure you can't die or fail at all in the game, even when you mess up the button prompts. It's not to say that Beyond is bad, it just shouldn't be considered a game. If you are a parent planing on buying the game for their child, here are some things you should know. And if you're anyone wanting to buy the game for yourself, stop reading and read another review because there are some major spoilers here. First, there are some very mature themes in this game, including, but not limited to child molestation, underage drinking, corrupted military officials, suicide, a mother having to give away her child, and of course, lots and lots of violence. It should be noted however that the player usually has a choice on how they can go about these situations. Although most bad situations inevitably happen anyway, the player still has some choice in the actions the protagonist takes. For example, in one scene the protagonist is at a party, and birthday girl offers you some beer. You have to option whether or not to actually drink it. As for sex, it really isn't anything you wouldn't see from a PG-13 movie. Jodie (the protagonist) gets naked a few times, but her breasts, butt, and private parts are never exposed. You have an option if you want to have sex or not, including a comment where Jodie says "We still have time before I have to go." to one of her possible love
