The Outer Worlds!
Phenomenal Game
Great
Must play
I cannot stress how awesome this game is. It is very engaging with incredible gameplay and a layered narrative. However, it does contain some gore, violence, and language. The gore is not too terrible unless the player uses tactical time dilation, which slows time and increases the blood and gore showed during a kill while it is active. Playing without it will limit gore to post-battle carnage, which can also be avoided if the player just doesn't loot the bodies, and the will actually make the game faster paced and more action oriented. The language is not over the top, but you will hear the f word sparsely and read cursing in messages found on various computer consoles found in the world. Though the game doesn't have any real sexual content, there is a character who is interested in dating another character with the same gender, and at one point the ship's computer asks for some "privacy" with the cleaning robot on the ship. There is also a part on a side mission where you inhale a bunch of drugs or something and talk to a guy's dead mother or something, but I wasn't paying attention and the whole section is easy to skip. Overall, the good vastly outweighs the bad, so I would recommend waiting until you are/your kid is, 15 &amp; 1/2 or 16 before playing.
Now I think it is ok for kids 11 If they can handle it, because it can get really violent at times. You can be shooting humans on Terra-2 or Stabbing aliens on Monarch. There is a range of weapons to use. TO wrap this up I think if your kid can handle violence and swearing it is ok.
not easy to play and very bloody
This RPG game is a masterpiece! The game play is extensive and intriguing, the graphics and scenery are beautiful, and it's overall very creative. It teaches good morals and really tests your inner conscience. Who will you help? The rebels that are sick of their lives or the corporations. Also, the game was created by some of the same people that created the Fallout series so if you love those games, you are guaranteed to like The Outer Worlds. The only thing I think parents should be concerned about is the fact that they use the F-Word about once every 30 minutes.
I absolutely LOVE this game. There's a lot of things that make this game so great. First of all, there are intense battles, with both humans and animals. Plus, the scenery is beautiful! When you talk to in-game characters, it seems super realistic. The characters have a very sarcastic sense of humor, which will have me cracking up at the most random satire. I know parents are usually paranoid about their kids playing M rated games, but
