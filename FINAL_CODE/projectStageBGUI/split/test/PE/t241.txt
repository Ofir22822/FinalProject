 calm them down and get to know them. There is 2 bits of profanity from the characters, however it is hardly noticeable even if you have good ears. Team building is key in this game. If anyone says different I suggest they actually play the game and see for themselves. Communicating with other teammates about “not pressing” or “staying back” is litterally the basis of the entire game. A child with the maturity of a goldfish could play this game. This game is the best shooter game if you don’t want your children to have the more violent, grotesque games like COD or Battlefield.
While there are ever-so-slightly less violent FPS that have managed to get an E/E10+ rating, I would consider Overwatch the more kid-friendly game. As Common Sense Media mentioned in their review, Overwatch has unique good messages to it, such as that morality is not always black or write, how to overcome obstacles and work with others. The violence is relatively mild, even when compared to other T-rated shooters. For example, Halo 5 had a bit more realism to it, and the blood splatter was on-screen for longer. In Overwatch, blood is infrequent, and the whole game has an abstract style to it separating it easily from reality.
There is no sex or drugs in it other than the cigar used by one of the characters. This game focuses on strategy rather than violence and teaches kids a lot about tactics. There is no point to not get this game for your children. Great game! I think kids 8 and under cannot handle the online interactions although, and thus I rate it 9 and up!
great game for your kids
The common sense media review is completely ridiculous. There is 0 sex AT ALL. There are 0 drugs AT ALL. The closest you can get to a drug is a cowboy smoking a cigar, but what do you expect? PG tv shows have people smoking cigars soo what's the problem? Very little blood, guns are cooler than they are dangerous. Dismemberment of a character? There's a robot character when he dies spring and screws go everywhere... When a character explodes, it's body just turns to a rag doll. I hate the poor kids that are told no over getting this game because CSM said its 13+ and gave false info.
I don't know why CSM says that it is 14+! The only thing I can think of is unmoderated chat. It helps teamwork, communication, and thinking ahead. You work in a team of 6 to either take control of, or defend a certain point, and players need to communicate to do well. It has MILD violence, nothing very bad. Some characters, such as Widowmaker, have some cleavage, but not as bad as some things. Overall, an amazing game, I would recommend this to anyone (who is mature) 8+.
Overwatch is an excellent game and definently one of my favorites. It's nothing like any other FPS game I've ever played. I would personally say
