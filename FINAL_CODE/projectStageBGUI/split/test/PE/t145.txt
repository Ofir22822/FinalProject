 Don't know why it has such a bad rep
Monitor your kid whilst he's playing if you don't want him seeing some gore or stuff - other than that, fine.
If your kid can handle a little swearing and some violence, they’re fine.

Love It This Game Was So Masterpiece And Esstential Of The The Best Game Ever
Must be mature
Honestly I see nothing wrong with the game. I've been playing it for a good 30 hours (15 in campaign and 15 in online). Campaign is much more inappropriate, so if your child can't handle sex or gore either sit down with them and talk or tell them to only play online. In online it's a lot more toned down and less nude or gory. But definitely let your kid try it out if you already have the game or let them get it.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fine game that I believe can be given to any kid who can take some violence and F-bombs. Gore is very small - maybe a blood splatter or two from bullets but ultimately, nothing that could give your kid trauma or something. Sexual stuff - Yet again, it's one of those things you have to look for to actually find. Whilst the player can take a bath, a woman (fully dressed) can enter if the player allows her. She will then help clean the player, but no real nudity can be seen. Another time, a small, small, rare situation can come at camp when somebody flashes somebody else (with their ass) for a few seconds. Rare though. A morality system is in play that could teach kids right from wrong, and gradually, the story builds off your honor. Those with bad honor eventually go down a bad path and have many woes occur. However, those with a good honor who help people will eventually come out on top. Good message, and good role models. Get it for your kid.
If your child has played any other game in existence that is rated M then this is fine for them. There’s a lot of drugs but they’re all optional.
So far I’ve spent around 5-6 hours playing it and the worst thing in it is just a bit of blood the worst swear word u hear is f**k but that’s only used in reasonable situations eg: your being ambushed but hearing f**k is nearly as rare as getting a perfect condition deer pelt with a car it rifle It’s a really good game and I think it would be a shame if anyone missed out on it
Has little to no sexual
