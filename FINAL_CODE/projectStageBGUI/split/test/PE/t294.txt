 there is 1 specific character that smokes, but that's the most you'd see. There is minimal swearing, though too small of an amount to even notice, As for "partial nudity" there is 1 character with an open gap within the front of the outfit, other than that,there is a few "slim" outfits that aren't too blatantly inappropriate. But like i said, the ESRB rating is right, the game should be meant for 13+ teens and adults.
Overwatch is a 6 VS 6 multiplayer FPS game by Blizzard, makers of World Of Warcraft and Starcraft among other things. It somewhat borrows from the MOBA genre of games with its ability based method of combat. You have a weapon, sometimes 2 like Torbjorn having a hammer and a shotgun-type thing that fires molten metal, an alternate-fire sometimes like Roadhog's mid-range shot, and a handful of abilities such as Pharah being able to rocket up into the air or shoot a missile that knocks back players. All heroes have an ultimate ability that can change the tide of battle, such as Mercy reviving all of her teammates within range or Junkrat activating a remote controlled exploding tire, but ultimate abilities(commonly referred to as ults) have to charge up before unleashing their power. There are 25 heroes, with more on the way. Each hero comes from a different background and has a different play style, such as the speedy British Tracer who can teleport and rewind her own time back a few seconds to the Korean mecha pilot Hana Song, also known as D.Va, who can charge in and provide supporting fire with her rapid-fire cannons to the popular DJ L?cio, who plays a song to either heal his teammates or increase their movement speed. Games are fast and fun, and if you join a custom game you can play fun mini games like Hide And Seek or Simon Says. Blood is limited to a red pixels showing up on your screen when shooting at a target at close range and has no blood splatter effects on the ground or walls. There are a large number of female characters(almost half the cast of heroes) so it includes strong role models. There is some mild swearing but that's limited to a couple of characters saying "damn" and that's only if the filter is turned off.. Voice chat is unmoderated but if someone is being annoying or rude you can mute their audio and you won't hear them speaking. Maps range from taking place in an abandoned castle in Germany to the fictional city of Hanamura, Japan, to even on the moon! Straightforward controls and excellent design with characters, maps, and mechanics make Overwatch, all in all, very fun and enjoyable.
Really fun game, lots of diversity, great for all ages.
