Modern Warfare(2019) is a great addition to the Call of Duty Franchise. The Game is not gory compared to other games in the series. The game however includes images of people being gassed, and has some depressing backstory images(hanging, etc). The one scene that is the worst is where you have to interrogate a terrorist and use his family as leverage/hostages. Besides this it is a game certainly worth playing.
note: I played the campaign all the through just last night, so this is still fresh in my mind. the campaign was gritty, and death was commonplace. this doesn't mean much, as death is common in even games like minecraft. it all depends on how it's delivered. there is blood, which you can turn off. there is dismemberment, which you can turn off. this game paints a picture of a secret war, and is sure to show it's evils. there are hostage situations mid-level in some parts of the game, and depending on how quick the player acts, you can save them. as far as I can tell, there are only about 7 civilian deaths in the entire game, all without blood. this game has mature themes, don't give it to your 8-year-old, but this is a good game to ease people in from either more "Kiddie" games (again, like minecraft) or more peaceful, relaxed games, like animal crossing. in summary, this is a good game, made great by the fact that you can turn down the mature parts of it, to make it a little less heavy-handed. I'd say 13-year-olds could absolutely handle this. hell, I did!
This game has many different modes so you have to know what you're getting in to!. Let's start off with the campaign mode which in a nutshell is pretty much just a playable story (for anyone who doesn't know what a campaign is). Ya, it's gory and violent and should be left for 17+. I'm not going to get into the contents of the campaign but let's Just say it's mature. BUT co-op and multiplayer should be just fine If your kid knows to write and wrong. However, thair is dismemberment but it can be turned off in the settings. As for language as well. When you kill someone they scream and realistically fall to the ground. You do have the option to turn this off by putting the dialogue volume to zero. Overall I don't think that it should be a problem for a 12-year-old to play multiplayer.
the action is over the top and awesome great online nothing suggestive strong language is moderate blood short campaign good story fun to play with friends good messages
