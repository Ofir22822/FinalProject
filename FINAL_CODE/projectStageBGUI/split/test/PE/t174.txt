 scenes and was definitely not too much for 13 year olds. Overall the media has portrayed modern warfare as a gross scary game when really it just takes a bit of maturity and some changes in the settings to make it appropriate for all teens.
The game is essentially divided into a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign takes you through the story of anti-terrorists. The campaign alone should be 14+ due to some brutal scenes but with the gore and blood filter it becomes 13+ as it is mature for most kids. The reason the campaign isn't worse is because it makes you realise what's going on isn't good and that violence shouldn't be glorified. It is essentially like a 15 rated war film that is a lot less bloody if you want it to be as it portrays war as something brutal that shouldn't be enjoyed. tHe multiplayer is a 11+ as there is little blood to no blood and noinappropriate scenes. As opposed to many stereotypes of Call of Duty it isn't as bad as media portrays it.
This game has Blood, Decapitation, Main Purpose is killing people, You do interrogate people, lots of swearing, Cut scenes have some intense potentially scary violent acts. One of the badges you can get shows a person smoking weed. This game is a pretty fun game but kids shouldn't play it until they're 18.
Great graphics but very violent - I would truly rather my kids watched united than this, and that is saying something!
Multiplayer fine for ages 11+ but I’d wait until your kid is 13-14 to play campaign (Pretty gruesome and dark). This game is awesome the sound affects and detail are next to none. And it looks great on Xbox. Multiplayer is just fine for younger kids when you shot an enemy there is a little puff of blood but nothing crazy. Campaign can be dark at time and disturbing, but I think it was 100% worth it to include that content. The game has a more realistic feel.
This game is pretty violent, and inappropriate all around. I would defenitly not let anyone under 13 play this game, but it might be ok to let a 13 year old play it. It really depends on their maturity. If you have a teen that cusses without you allowing them to, is really obsessed with guns (if they talk about murder or guns too much), or if they take drugs or do anything illegal don’t let them play. If they do none of these things, it’s completely fine to let a teen play. There are positive role models (not a lot) and lessons despite the very dark topic, and it’s better to learn about the real hard things as a kid than an adult. Do monitor your kids behavior just in case, but don’t take it away if they do one wrong thing. I’d personally say almost any kid should be able to play this, and parents need to really think hard about
