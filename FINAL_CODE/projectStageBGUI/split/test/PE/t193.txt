Star wars jedi fallen order
Realistic, but not that violent
I think it’s a great game it’s the first game that EA isn’t trying to take your money and follows the Star Wars plot perfectly 100% worth it
Ok pegi is wrong. This game is fine for 11 and up. There is no blood or gore. But it is quite difficult.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single player action adventure game developed by Respawn Entertainment, the developers of Apex Legends. In Fallen Order, players play as Cal Kestis, the survivor of the Jedi Purge. Untrusting and frightened, Cal needs to relearn the ways of the Force to find a list of Force-Sensitive children. Accompanying him are Cere Junda, a Former Jedi, Greez Dritus, a stubborn pilot, and the adorable BD-1. However, he is being hunted by the evil Imperial Inquisitor, the Second Sister and her platoons of Stormtroopers and Purgetroopers. The game has excellent mechanics, from the sword fighting gameplay inspired by Breath of the Wild, Sekiro, and Dark Souls, to the puzzle solving aspect similar to Portal, as well as a 62+-0ridiculous poncho customizer. The game features a natural progression system, with a skill tree. The game is currently harboring a good 79% on Metacritic. Some things I really think help the game are the customization, the satisfaction of wal running, and the interesting story. One drawback is the story feels a little short. I would give JFO a 4.7/5. Some of the encounters with bad guys can be a little violent, but you can only dismember non humans. It might be a little scary sometimes, though.
star wars the jedi fallen order is a fun game to play and its story mode is really nice but a kid of 8 can play it and not under 8 kids can not play it
Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is honestly one of my favorite video-games of all time. I thought it would be another Star Wars video-game failure (no offense) just like Star Wars Battlefront II. Cause that game wasn’t all that great. However, the graphics are really great, the plot / story is very engaging and brilliant, and about halfway through the game I felt empathy for all these characters. This game FELT like it had the potential to be an amazing spin-off Movie, just like Solo and Rogue One. Also, the controls are astonishing. It is very easy to maneuver and it is satisfying to take control of a Jedi. As Cal Kestis, you can use Force Push, Force Freeze, Force Pull, Pull out double bladed lightsaber,
