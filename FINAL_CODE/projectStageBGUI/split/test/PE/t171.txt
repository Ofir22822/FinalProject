 sale but for what you get its worth it. You get a full stories mode that will last at least a couple of weeks if you are very good at the game and at least 20 different game modes that change every week witch creates more of a diversity of things to do. to completely master the game it will take more than a year so 80 bucks of a year of gaming is yes for me and should be the same for you.
At first my 14 year old son asked me for this game and I said no as it was rated 18+ and I thought it was violent. However after he told me that he could handle it I realised that I should take a look at it and put my self in his shoes to see if it would effect him. It’s not as bad as you think and although yes it does have blood in it I think some parents forget that (especially if they are a teen like mine) they aren’t a little kid anymore and as long as they have a loving family and home, will be fine.
In the campaign, it is violent, lots of curse words(f and s mostly), and bloody. It has a good story though. The multiplayer is not nearly as violent, and so much fun. You can customize weapons and have cool camps on them. There is a couple of calling cards that are bad. There’s 1 where it has a girl saying da f***, but that’s the only bad one, and is simi rare to see. Warzone is just like multiplayer in bad stuff but it is a battle royal game mode. Over all the game is one of my favorites and could be handeled by mature 11 year olds, but the Campaign should be played at 13+. Note that you can now disable the campaign. Just watch a video on it.
I think is a violent game but is not for 18+ I think 12+ Little bit bad words. violence but its enought to 12 years old kids.
Some other adults are saying that gamechat and gore etc isnt good for your child, you can easily turn it off in settings, i would much recommend maybe 12 to 13. story mode 14 plus as it is gory swears often and is a bit old for children, if your child wants this game they probably want it to play with friends, it is a blast with friends and if you were to say no to them then theyd probably be missing out on fun with friends, after all lockdown can get boring
campign is the only bad part of this game the filters for blood and violence are a great addition. campaign is 17+ and the rest of game is 13+ in my opinion
I think most parents know that CSM overacts on games. Have you found one MA rated game on this app rated anything but 18. No you haven’t. So how
