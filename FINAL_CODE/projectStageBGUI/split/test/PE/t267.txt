The game is based off of a task force named "Overwatch" (hence the name) which is based upon protecting humanity from robots known as Omnics. Although the game contains a character with a cigar, nonetheless, it should have the Content Descriptor of "Tobacco Reference", rather than "Use of Tobacco". The game contains mild blood and gore, which is very unnoticeable. The game is, however, very toxic, so beware. Edit: I forgot to mention that there are multiple uses of the word s**t, but both are within reason after something negative happens to them.
I highly recommend this game if your kid wants to get into Shooters but does not have the experience for a game such as a Rainbow Six Siege the mechanics are great and really easy to play I love this game and I plant a lot and well there's close to zero mature content I am inclined to mention that there is a bit of violence but all of the weapons that character is used are some form of energy blaster and they're not guns and even if you're really against guns players still have the option to use other items however if you are a hardcore FPS fan I would not recommend this game for you because it will get boring for you fast I highly recommend this game for younger kids
Overwatch is a online first person player game from Blizzard Entertainment where you chose a hero to eliminate enemies using gun aim and various skill. Each character has i own skill and special which is very useful will eliminating the opposition. This is a very fun game with lots of modes but it has some problem-- hack users.this user uses hack like aim hack, which makes them overpowered and it makes the game not very fun. I think this game will be even better if Blizzard blocks this kinds of hack. However I think Overwatch is a game that is worth its price if you have a great aim and great decision making skill. This game has great graphics, lots of mods, custom matches,and also ranked matches.I do not recommend this game if you do not have good aim or you do not like cartoon graphics. First this game can be very stressful if you can’t kill anyone because of your aim and secondly people have different types of game they like and if you are expecting something realistic this is not the game for you. If you like games like Fortnite then this is a game for you-- it has a cartoon graphics like Fortnite and it also requires aim like Fortnite.
Yes, there is voice chat, but
