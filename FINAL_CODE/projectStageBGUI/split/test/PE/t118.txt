 in combat purely to survive but it becomes the message that the game plays. On occasions the player will kill "Scorched" and "feral ghouls" who were humans but they don't have any higher brain function which to some extent is deemed murder. The game does contain a voice chatting function but it can be controlled in the settings. Overall the game is violent but it is mainly due to a VERY MATURE background which it can be best to talk to kids about or whether they ask questions about certain elements of the game. I would suggest that the person playing this game can be very mature about the content they experience within the game.
If you want you child to be able to play a fallout game let them play any game but this. Fallout 4 and New Vegas were awesome and very child friendly, but this one was hot trash. It also killed corn dogs.
Well first of all i am 12 and have it......ITS NOT AS BAD AS 4! The community is also very nice
i have played all the fallout games and i am a god at them if you need a tutor this is me on dicord ortega234 and me on xbox live statedevening71 but lets talk about fallout 76 it has blood and gore it got more hard couse its online the gameplay is allot more wack but its good
The game has some violence but is totally fine. My first grade student played with his older siblings and loved it! He used it ashas main source for his science project on nuclear warfare. His gravely unenlightened teacher told him his project was unrealistic. I had to go in and explain how nuclear bombs are real!
Fallout 76 met a very controversial launch back in 2018 (for good reason), however, since then a number of updates have hit the game, improving it to a playable state yet still showing it has flaws. The game itself takes place in the Fallout universe, an alternate-history post-apocalyptic world where your role is to... well... survive. As with all fallout games, it is pretty violent; an array of guns and melee weapons can be used to shoot and beat opponents, often resulting in bloody battles with limbs and heads occasionally being blown off the opponents. The combat does have a slightly goofy edge to it, making it not feel highly realistic and so more appropriate for teens. With the new dialogue system, there is occasional swearing; ‘f**k, s**t, d**k’ etc. however nothing too offensive nor overly frequent. Alcohol and drugs can be taken, however they have more comical rather than realistic side effects. The online aspect of the game does expose you to other players, however the community is mostly very kind/supportive and it can be easily ignored if you wish to play solo. The game still suffers from issues, such as weaker side quests and characters, in comparison to its predecessors, however it is now a much more competent and somewhat fun
