 Awkward controls and boost gimmick may ruin the game for you.
Easy to play, hard to master.
It's standard issue cart racing. weapons, cutesie characters and various tracks set in cartoon environments with hazards and speed boosts. Our problem with this game is HOW you boost and the uncomfortable control layout, and even with a second control layout option, neither works well. I'm a gamer and I found my hand cramping (and I play games where ALL the buttons, even the stick ones are used), In order to gain boost you have 2 buttons that are the same, it's a hop/ drift button, being both bumper buttons. You start the drift with one button and hold it down but DO NOT try to steer back at all until the hop is done as it is unforgiving, then each time your meter fills and you see black smoke , you hit the other one up to 3 times for boost. The boost happens 'during" the drift also instead of the standard of gaining it for straightaways making it exeptionally hard to steer when pulling this off. The gas can be the Right trigger or the bottom pad button but the whole process is very tedious and button mashy This is along with the fact that in many cases you need to stop doing one thing in order to press your attack button for items. The drifting/ boost mechanic does NOT flow well and makes it hard to steer at all and it's more of a hinderance to staying on the track than LITERALLY anything else in the game. We love Mario Kart, Blur and even Sonic All Stars and Sonic Team racing were decent. But THIS just feels unenjoyable with a tedious mechanic that simply breaks our ability have fun with this game, Younger ones may get especially frustrated with the finicky timing and button yoga you have to acheive unlike just about any other cart and racing games. I wasted 40 bucks. Better to go Sonic Team Racing in our opinion. Couldn't be more bummed how bad the controls are here, and it's paramount to winning any race at all to progress. Cuz if you can't boost consistantly and often, you may as well not even play it and that's the sad truth.
A little bit too hard for kids ages 6 and under but aside from that there's only one thing and that's microtransactions. Microtransactions are in this game and they are NOT micro. They can cost up to $11.
Okay For Kids Who Think
Doesn't deserve to be rated Mature...
One of my favourite games
Simple concept with arcade style dumb fun.
Okay for tweens. Some violence. No language. Fun game. I approve.
Let me start off the review by saying that this game is not as violent as the website shapes it out to be. It does involve violence, but the blood can be turned off through settings. Even with blood on, you can tell it’s fake through the ketchup-like effects. Ignoring the violence, the game
