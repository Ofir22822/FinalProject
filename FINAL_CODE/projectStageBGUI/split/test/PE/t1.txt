Dynamax Ruins The Game For Everyone
A very good game
Long time fan and parent
An epic new adventure!
Disappointing.
Still not worth the money but has been improved...
It's fun for kids like myself it's a favourite
It's a great game with some kid friendly messages mixed in.
Note: I do not own a Nintendo Switch, and I do not intend to purchase one. Parents need to know that SWSH does not feature Mega Evolution or Z-moves, gimmicks from the previous generations' metagames. Furthermore, transfer from Gen VII is currently not possible. Dynamax ruins the balance of Pok?mon, and the new Galarian forms outshine other Pok?mon. One good note about SWSH is at least Gyms had returned instead of Island Challenges. I give this game a 2 out of 5.
Pok?mon sword and sheild are the best Pok?mon games ever bede is a very good character he is a good character
Ive been playing Pokemon since 1997 and over those 22 years ive seen some big and small changes to one of the main game fraancises i love. I started out with the anime in 1997 and got yellow for my birthday the next year and have never looked back. What I love about this francise is how kid friendly it is and some of the values it teaches of friendship and careing the anime values as well as every time anew game comes out with new pokemon it challenges the player even more to think stratagy and how this would work with this move and so forth. In other words get kids heads thinking and helping to learn how to stratagise. A usefull skill to have in this everyday world. Now ive heard of the bugs and the glitches but im still looking foraward to really playing the copy my wife got me for christ,mas. and this thing about not all the pokemon being in it? Didnt red and blue just start out with 150? Besides pokemon home is comeing out next year and i dont think itll be forever that we will not asee the missing pokemon in game. After all dont they patch up games all the time and update them on the switch? What im trying to say is if anyparent asks me the number one kid safe game to play my first answer is always pokemon. To me its the number 1 computer game for all ages for everyone to enjoy
As usual, several female characters are scantily clad in two-piece swimsuits or similarly revealing clothing.
I'm just gonna start off by saying that while I thought $60 was a bit overkill, this game was definitely worth the wait. This game may not have had anywhere near a complete pokedex, but it had plenty of new pokemon of unique designs and movesets and two new legendaries to catch. The character designs and humor in the game was also very well done. The dynamax battles were very fun and engaging and the graphics were very beautiful and polished and definitely not glitchy. After
