 you have the option to disable it in settings.
Now, I’m a die-hard nintendo fanboy, but Overwatch has reeled me into the shooter genre with its in-depth roster and each characters unique moveset. It’s character system is like smash. Everyone essentially can do the same thing, but they do it in different ways. Only down side is the fanbase, NEVER, under ANY circumstances go there. Other than that, 9/10.
Great game, I've been playing it non stop. Overwatch is a first person shooter containing different characters you can play as, each with unique abilities. For example, there are characters who deal mostly damage, there are tanks, and there are healers. Parents should know there is open voice chat, but you can leave it if you want. The game is kind of strategic and some characters are unbalanced, which Is why i recommend this game to kids 11+, depending on their skills. But it's your decision. I think it's super family friendly. Only thing is tight skinned or a little bit of revealing outfits on some female characters, but nothing too inappropriate. You also don't really need to worry about your kid spending too much money on it, you get loot boxes containing at least 4-5 items every to you level up, and leveling up is super easy.
The game is basically an online PvP shooting game with an anime/Disney-like art style,there is a good variety of charaters with different gameplay,there is no gore despite being a shooting game,a few female characters have revelating outfits,is not mentioned on the game,but Soldier 76 is gay and Tracer is lesbian,there are comics and animated shorts who explain the story of the game
I'll start off by mentioning my background. I'm 17, got this game on my 16th birthday. My parents are VERY conservative and are absolutely appalled by gore and gun violence. Even as someone who is on the brink of early adulthood, and someone who spends their time gaming alone, they refuse to allow high-violence FPS (first person shooter games), or really most FPS at all. Same goes for something that is high in sexual content, be it with risque clothing or with sexual acts. But my parents actually approved of Overwatch, after researching it. There IS blood, but it is so small and difficult to see in the high, cartoony-action, that it isn't bothersome. Not all heroes use guns, and I find the game so enjoyable, pretty, and diverse that it's hard to put down. I will note that heroes will say "damn" in certain interactions, and if i'm not mistaking "hell" is also used. But that's it for language. Females wear tight clothing, but it isn't overly graphic. Only one hero currently reveals any cleavage, and it's pretty mild. The same character, "Widowmaker," is known for her voluptuous bottom, but it's nothing to be overly concerned with, in my opinion. All in all, I highly recommend this game. There is also interaction with other people which is always unpredictable unless you refuse to allow
