Great Game

Best game ever
There is nothing wrong with this game except for violence. It is completely unrealistic and about as bad as fortnite. I haven’t seen any revealing outfits yet. As long as you have chat off, this is a kid friendly game.
There's not really any drugs or sex (Except for McCree who holds a cigar) The most family friendly and better than Call of Duty
What an evil Satan game, no kids should ever touch this trash heap. I mean what theheck it has guns!!!!!1. This is why World War III is going to happen. Teaching kids to kill others is just degrading our society. Not to mention the endless bugs they add in disguised as ‘DLC,’ whatever that is. My kids are way more classed than this dump.
I have this game and I play it alot. Overwatch is a multiplayer game that you fight each other in battles of 6v6. The only 2 things you need to know is That some heroes in the game like Reaper say D-mn! when someone is attacking him. The second reason is that widowmaker wears a suit that shows her bo-bs. I hoped this helped you. : )
This game is a pice of crap there are so many better first person shooters out there that are more balanced and more fun.The balancing in the game is horrible Call Of Duty Ghosts is better
some characters have reveling or tight clothing but nothing graphic. one character smokes a cigar. when a character is shot there's little to no blood shown. occasionally characters might say "damn" if they get hit. most characters show good role models. some mature 8 year olds could be allowed to play.
i love this game i like the cartoon y feel but also the fps feel its a real nice game a lot of kids can play this its not close to anything thing real the heroes have different things that there good at and powers etc.. its a great game 5 and up could play
Find a match,have fun.simple as that.
This game is great. I got it when I was like 12 or 13 I think and I've been playing it since. It promotes teamplay and cooperation, and the underlying theme behind all of the heroes' reasons for fighting is to "protect the innocent," as one character even says. Overwatch is a 6 v 6 teambased first person shooter where the goal is to capture an opjective, not just to slaughter the other team. The controls are easy to get the hang of, but some characters
