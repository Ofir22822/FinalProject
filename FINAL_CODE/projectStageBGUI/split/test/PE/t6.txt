 "oversexualized." I really just wanted to point out that if there is a movement or dance step that you really aren't comfortable with doing, there's nothing stopping you from simply skipping that step. The only thing that will happen will be a slight decrease in points. But overall I really love Just Dance and will continue to play their games in the future!
Many of the dances that the women do are very saductive and sexual. The songs are inappropriate. I do not think girls of any age should be dancing like this.
Just Dance bumps back up to the E10+ for this game (last year's game was rated as the regular old E), and normally stays comfortably within the boundaries of that rating. Most 'inappropriate' lyrics (profanity, sexual content, drugs/alcohol, etc) are blanked out entirely. However, there are still a few songs that parents may want to skip over: "bad guy" by Billie Eilish contains the lyrics "Make your girlfriend mad type/Might seduce your dad type" and "I like it when you take control/Even if you know that you don't/Own me, I'll let you play the role/I'll be your animal." "God is a woman" by Ariana Grande contains numerous sexual allusions and is probably the most sexually forward song in the game; "You love it how I move you/You love it how I touch you", "I'm telling you the way I like it, how I want it", "Baby, lay me down and let's pray". A "Kids Mode" is available for very young players, free of any objectionable content.
Big fun for way older teens who want to learn some of the latest dance moves. Unfortunately, a song by BLACKPINK featured choreography completely inappropriate for younger girls. Parents could easily skip over the suggestive choreography and ignore negative lyrics, but it’s unlikely kids of any age will follow suit as they’re accumulating points and learning by repetition. After noticing other sites rated Dance 2019 for younger kids than Dance 2020, we’ll be trying that out instead. I’m not a strict parent, but it would be great to see this game redesigned so that all levels can be enjoyed by anyone in the family,; especially considering kids generally are able to bypass parental settings.
Kids in our house of all ages love it. We have six kids ages 2 to 11. The younger kids play the kid version the older kids like the regular version. The regular version does have some mild swearing and sexuality. But like I said just put the kids on the kids version and they still love it!
It has great music! Yes the unlimited is worth buying. Great way to exercise! The game sometimes doesn’t censor words but there is a kid version so that’s why I said 5 and up.
