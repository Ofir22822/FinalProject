 this game expecting it to be inappropriate to the extreme, however I was wrong. There is no sex whatsoever in the game, as I have watched videos on it, there is no n word, and the game is barely violent in terms of guns. There are virtually no swear words. I do not know how this game is able to warrant an "M" rating, it should really be T:violence. My son does not play any m games, but I would give this an exception. I might have to steal this idea from another review, but it makes perfect sense violence 4/10 little blood splatters but nothing too bad languages 1/10 They say D*mn every like hour you play the story mode Common sense is wrong, there is no n word themes 2/10 There is no bad themes, their are positive themes like womens rights. sex 0/10. No sex
I am a parent of 1 boy, and I never let him see r movies, hardly and pg13 movies, and he is not allowed to play call of duty or any other m games. However this game changed my view as I viewed it, and I did not hear any instances of the "n" word, and barely any other cuss words. I did not encounter any sexual themes,(the 0.2 second blurred sex scene was removed.). Or not required. And there is a few splatters of blood that did not seem to violent. So I decided to let my 13 year old get this game.
I am a huge gamer and I absolutely love this game. It is a much better and a much more appropriate version of GTA 5. People think it is by the creators of GTA so don't let their kids go and get it, but not really. Their is so much violence in GTA and the point of that game is to kill people but Red dead redemption is about making friends and living a life in the west. There is a little bit of swearing but it really isn't that bad because you can play an online game and there will be real people cursing on their mic and that would be much worse than this game. The biggest turning point is the drinking, but there is so little of it in the game and it is bad for your character that is kind of just their and pointless. The blood is like the blood in the Fallout series it is in very quick portions so it is kid of hard to see. I would give it the same rating as fortnite because fortnite is about killing everybody but is has no blood. If you let your kid play Fallout 76, Fortnite, Assassin's creed and Call of duty the game should be completely okay.
i think its a good game for kids with no sex sceans i have completed the game and the game is over all a very well done game
