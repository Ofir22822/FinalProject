 again Common Sense Media exaggerates
Far cry new dawn is an excellent open world game, and parents should not be worried, for all blood can be turned off in settings. Most of the bad language in this game is on the radio, in songs, so as long as that is off, it will be fine for your child. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope parents aren’t mislead by common senses over-exaggerating review.
Like several fellow parents have said this game is not bad. It hasviolence but it isn't gory. It has some language but is mainly on the radio and it can be turned off.
This game is perfect for a child who is 13 years of age or older. I bought this game for my son, Jeremy who is 13 years old. I really don't understand why commonsense media gives this game 18 and up and why the esrb rates it "mature". First lets start of with the violence: There is shooting, it being a first person shooter makes that obvious, but there is no over the top violence. There is blood but there is no gore. Language wise: There is language on the radio, which is in pretty much in any game that has vehicles with radios, but other than not there really is little to none. Drugs: None Sex: None. I really hope that this helps, it is a very fun game that i think that your teens would LOVE!
i use common sense media a lot on things for my son but my son got this game for his birthdayand ive got to admit its not as bad as common sense media say it to be as its all about freedom and it may have gore but not as much as kids see on tv and films
The violence is the same as Halo. So if your child plays Halo it’s fine. There is no sex whatsoever and the swearing is only on the radio. Just tell your children not to use the radio and it’ll be fine.
It’s really cool!
One of the best Post-Apocalyptic game in a good while
a night girls
Very Good game
Good but has nudity.
I watched my son play this game for a while and the graphics are stunning. I’ve never seen anything like it. There’s a lot of violence and some language that’s mainly it . It looks really fun and I think if you have a good 13 year old or above it would be perfect.
If you looking for a Post-Apocalyptic game with the excellent graphic and gameplay mechanics, you will most definitely enjoy this one. One of the downside in my opinion is the English voice acting and I recommend changing the audio to Russian voice instead. P.S There are some nudity with topless girls later into the game, therefor the Sex rating is not accurate.
In the beginning of the game when he was talking in the train they show a night girls with pinky lights.
This is a good game for mature 10 year olds.
