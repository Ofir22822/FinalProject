 groups with SPEED type, a "skill" type that goes through terrain effortlessly, and a sort of "tank" type that bashes through obstacles. The racer roster is ALL Sonic characters this time,so no other Sega All Stars make an appearance. Each car is tied to it's perspective character and has performance stats that can be upgraded as well as several asthetic components to customize the look of your car. All that said, it seems that the base game itself doesn't offer long term variety in the tracks or anything outstanding or meaningful to make them feel different or set one apart from the other, it just feels like a potluck of components mixed together in various ways rather than fully fleshed out and unique concepts. Over all, this is a good game to burn some time with family and friends for a few hours, but I don't think it will hold most peoples interests for long or keep you coming back. Also with Mario Kart 8 being a far superior game overall and Crash Bandicoot Kart Racing coming out, this one will probably end up on the pile of mediocre Sonic games. In the end, unfortunately, this is merely a novelty game at best which is disappointing given the long drought of quality Arcade racers the past few years on consoles and the opportune window they had to turn this into something memorable that gamers have been craving for quite some time. PS- Some of the tracks can be a little blurry and confusing, especially trying to look into the distance. We recommend a 4k TV for best performance as anything below that can be a strain on the eyes, especially the larger TVs where the pixels are enlarged and less defined. This game in particular has some poor depth color schemes in a few tracks and this is especially noticable in racing games in general. Smaller TVs should be fine in single player, but 4k HD will be highly beneficial on larger TVs, especially playing split screen co-op.
It's sonic the hedghog? Ok I'll buy that thanks
I play this game with my son and it is great
Boring
Hate it
No thanks.
first I want to say that commence has consumerism at 4 out of 5 which I think is crazy it should only be at 2 or 3 out of 5. But like I said in the title I play it with my son and we have a blast working together to take down behemoths . I am not a big fan of shooters because you shoot other people just trying to have fun playing a game but you can even hurt your team so you just work together to save the world. I think this dauntless is great for kids that just want to try a new game for free.
Play Monster Hunter. Cause this is just a clone of that but after 10h it gets boring as you are just replaying all the monsters at slightly higher level. Monster Hunter: World is free
