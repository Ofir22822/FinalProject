Fun just turn off blood
You can turn of most of the blood but still some and highly intense can turn off language YOU HAVE TO TURN ON DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION
Amazing game super fun. It has role models as in police and millatry saving civilians. Suicide bombers some desturbing scenes they lock suicide vest on innocent man and we get him but he can't be saved and is pushed over edge while begging and screaming . When sniping of u hit someone the thing you hit will explode. Swearing is sh** fu** and bas**rd.
So the age you should be to play the game all depends on if your playing multiplayer or campaign. If your playing multiplayer it should be about 10+ but campaign is a solid 13+ due to heavy violence
The new Modern Warfare is possibly one of the most morally disturbing video games I’ve played. The game tackles very serious war questions such as where the you should cross the line when it comes to what must be done. However, gameplay wise, this is one of my favorite games from 2019. This game is like sort of like R6 and is more strategic, while still having the face-paced combat of Call of Duty. When it comes to picking a good age for this game, it depends on what you’re child can take. The disturbing acts of terrorism depicted most likely will have an impact on kids, so it really depends. Violence: Being a first person shooter expect modern wartime violence including stabbing, shooting, and exploding with blood and sometimes gore. Every shot leads to spurting blood and the characters make very disturbing sounds of pain and role frantically. Depending on what weapons you use limbs can be dismembered including heads, they will explode into blood and chunks. This usually only happens with heavy snipers though, so it’s a somewhat rare occurrence. You can stab enemies resulting in blood. Sometimes you get the chance to execute engines and this usually leads to you stabbing an enemy through the neck or body, spurting blood. Explosions lead to blood and maybe gore (I couldn’t tell). There are many types of throwables such as deaf Fernandez and Molotov cocktails. Molotovs catch engines on fire and you can watch as they rithe in pain. However this is not the extent of the violence. On the campaign, many of the missions follow terrorist attacked ehoch are shown in full view. Women and children are killed onscreen. Attacks include bombings,
