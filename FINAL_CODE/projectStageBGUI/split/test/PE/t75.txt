As a gamer myself. I often like to play the same video games my 17 year old son plays. Apex is one of these games we both play it and I personally find the game addicting. Characters are super unique and diverse and the gameplay is astonishing. However, I do not recommend this game for anyone under the age of 16. Here’s why... 1. Loba is NOT for kids. So there are these characters in Apex called “legends” these legends are selected by the player and each has their own personality, skills, and play style. However their is a legend named “Loba” who was recently added to the game. She takes on the role of being a seductive [email protected]$!e. She has a handful of voice lines that are sexually explicit and are so frank a 10 year old could understand them. I want to keep this family friendly, but an example of one of her lines is “What I really want is down there.” They only get worse than that. Plus, her animations (you will see often) are of her showing off her “behind.” But you probably are thinking “I will just not let my son or daughter play her.” Well... I wish that were true, but she is a very popular character and will probably be on your team every other match. (Parents I advise you look up her animations and dirty Dialogue on YouTube so you can get a preview). 2. The community can be VERY toxic Just like every other competitive online game, there are troubled ”players.” I personally do not talk to other players because it would look weird for a 40 yr old man online to be talking to a maybe 16 yr old kid (I want to enjoy the game too, not come off as a creep). However, I often witness cyber bullying in this game. I try my best to get the bully punished. Most players in this game are between the ages of 15-26. If your child is below this age zone, I would not recommend they play the game for cyberbullying and online harassment purposes. The last thing you want is some 20 year old looser telling your child how ”bad they are” at the game. (it's a stupid reason
