 there were filters put in place to add a younger audience I suggest this game for your children aged 11+ (Some swearing but can easily be removed ) also great role models in the campaign. As long as your children are mature and doing well in school this game will be fine and maybe up knowledge in our would right now.
Call of duty Moden Warfare 2019 is rated M in America and MA in any other part of the world and I live in Australia so one day when my son came up to me and asked for this game I looked it up and saw that it was rated MA but then found out that you can turn of the blood, gore and swearing so it makes the game rated M and not MA. So I let my son get the game and I watched him play it for a bit and I made sure that he turned the blood and swearing off. And...... It really wasn’t that bad at all! The campaign is vey good because it teaches kids about war and history which in my opinion is great! Also the multiplayer has literally no blood at all! Even if you have the blood on there still won’t be any blood in the multiplayer! Also kids these days are very mature so they can very easily handle this. So if your kid is 11 or over and they ask to get this game, definitely say yes!
This game is so ok for 12+ not 18+ It is a great game because it teaches you about what is going on around the world in this type of war. It shows what people are risking to keep the world safe against terrorists.
I was reading other reviews that parents gave and they were way too serious. Like bruh 17 and up on the game case is BS first off. There are games TOTALLY rated M but they go Waay over board by saying “HECK” like wtf? But great for kids. Teaches about modern wars and is greatly dragged out in terms of the campaign, the general concept and playing aspects.
I am a mother of 3 boys 2 of whom are currently receiving second level education and I was always against them playing TOO much xbox and screens in general. My middle child who is now 13 and is starting to mature a bit asked me if he could get a game call call of duty modern warfare. He explained to me how the game works (bearing in mind I have never allowed him get Call Of Duty games before. I looked into it a bit and saw reviews mainly saying it is okay for teens 13 and up so I allowed him get it and he was very grateful for me allowing him to have it because a lot of children in his age group were playing it and talking about it and he wanted to join in their conversations. It may
