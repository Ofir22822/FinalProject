 background. My son always called them 'dreams'. Some of it seems like its a bit disturbing - a tween getting in to trouble or being chased etc. But, my son and I mostly ignored it. The background stuff does seem a bit creepy. I honestly didn't understand what was going on back there or the point of it. As I said, we mostly ignored it. The game is REALLY terrific. It's cute, fun, playful, beautiful and the single best time this father has had playing a video game with his son yet! I couldn't recommend it to a parent and any child 6 and above who is reasonably adept at using the controller and generally familiar with game playing mechanics.
Teens 12+
Not bad. Teens.
Its good but a lot of swearing and drugs
Not very much blood. Some frequent language that is used in game. If worried about cussing or bad language in game, I highly recommend turning off volume, as there are still indicators on screen that allows you to know what is happening in the game. No real drugs or achohol except for the green poison, which is used by the bad guys in the game to take over citizens. Barely any blood except for some bursts of blood when enemies are shot.
Small puffs of blood mist in combat. Some set pieces and aftermaths are bloodier/disturbing, but the game never gets gory. Frequent language. Its alot like Division 1 after its many updates plus some more tweaks, such as improved combat, level design, and multiplayer functionality. Loot is still kinda dry (this is Tom Clancy not Borderlands after all) but a strong sense of progression is there. The bosses are still lackluster but the journey is fun. I like the new setting better than before.
THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR KIDS THAT SAY THIS NOT A BAD GAME It was rated mature for a reason. There are dead bodies in a body bag everywhere in the city. I recommend you don't get your kid this game
Good game and it has no blood, which makes it good.
I don't allow my children to play games with blood, however they do play games with swords and weapons like this one. What I really like is that they play as someone that doesn't use any weapons, just his fruit which makes the character stretch. The game has no harm, and I played it before my kids did, and it is appropriate.
Just. Epic.
The game is so epic the word is even in the title. Just play it to see how epic it is!!!
Definitive hack & slash game still painfully immature.
Commonsense has no commonsense
Blood and Language
This just Rocks!
If you ever played Devil May Cry, you know what to exspect, just that THIS is the best version of itself. The gameplay, bosses and new character are great but the dialogue is dumb as usual, not to mention the mature themes that pop up and the sorely contrived CG action sequences straight out of a 12 year olds daydream.
