 am actually impressed as how very little sex there is compared to other rockstar games. You can also use drugs and alcohol. There is violence, but it's nothing a normal 13 year old can't handle. Then the main character, Arthur Morgan, often feels bad after commiting dishonorable actions, which is a good role model. Great Game, not that bad.
18+ not for kids
Hear me out
Language
is it OK for a pre teen
Fine
OK for mature Teens
Great game
Great game
Great game, little sexual activity!
You parents are bad parents if you think this game is alright for kids kids this game has nudity sexual content lots of sexual talk drugs and alcohol strong language blood and gore no kid under 18 should be playing this I played all the way through and have seen all of what it has not for kids
Monitor them. Mistake that’s supposed to be 11 up
I know 6 may seem extremely young for an m rated game but anything can be fine if they are supervised enough wall playing

In my option I say yes a mature preteen should be able to play this game by then they should be mature enough to handle this title there is only a few f bombs and there isn't much sexual content I can only think of two times and it didn't show any nudity it is also very fun and you child will be on it for a while considering it has a 60 hour campaign not including anything else i say let your kids play this if they are mature enough
If your kid can handle violence and language your fine
this is one of the types of games were you make your own choices You can just Rome around the west on a horse or murder people. The campaign has some swearing but middle schoolers have heard all that at school before. There is also like a second of non sexual male nudity but overall it is fine for mature tweens
Super good. Language, Violence is the same as any rockstar game. The one thing that shocked me is how little sexual stuff is in the game. Nothing a mature 12 could not handle.
Great game. Language is pretty bad along with violence. Nothing to terrible compared to some games/movies. Very little sex compared to Rockstars other games. Mature 12 year old can handle it if he or she knows what wrong vs right.
The only thing I am worried about for my kid is the nudity. I know that he can handle the language, violence, gore. The nudity is what worried me a bit. After researching quite a bit I have learned that there is partial nudity shown and a man and a woman engaging in a sexual act. This is only seen for a few seconds. When playing the game you can not ever
