 time. I liked it too until I saw stuff I didn't. Before I took my kids off, I thought to myself. "There has to be another version of the game.". Then, I found this. The Sims 4 Get Famous it totally appropriate and worth every penny I spent for it. My kids are now addicted to it, and it doesn't have any sex.
To be honest, it's an okay game. No sex, no violence. It's fun, you're finding your way in life. Yes, you can go on dates. You can have parties, jobs, and different careers. It does have consumerism. You have to save money to get what you want.
The Sims 4: Get Famous is about become a celebrity. I play it almost all the time. It has mild violence, but it also gives great message. It's telling you that you can be whoever you want to be as long as you put you mind to it.
My two sons just started playing The Sims Get Famous and I really like what I see so far. When the characters use the restroom, the parts are blurred. There isn't any sex so far. Although there is a tad bit of violence. Electrocution, passing out. Other than that, it's absolutely perfect.
I let my 13 - year - old daughter play this game, and at first I was a little skeptical after so much I've heard about The Sims 4. But then I decided to let my child have a little freedom and go ahead and play. I found out that the original game of The Sims 4 has most of the sex in it. But The Sims Get Famous is so much more appropriate for teens and tweens.
This game is fine for kids 7 + but don’t play at night some scenes are scary
even i played it and i am still scared no way i would let any of my three girls use this

Very Inappropriate for Younger Children
good game idea, but too much cursing
Good with friends, horrible online.
This is among kids
Good for kids older than 10
A fun game for kids, unfortunately the chat function means that there will be a lot of inappropriate and downright dangerous information being passed back and forth. I'll let my teenager play the game but our 10 year old is only allowed to play it in a private game room with people we know. I really wish games like this were designed with moderators observing chat to make sure children are allowed to remain children.
This is a cute game and the idea is great however......There are very foul mouthed immature teens that play
