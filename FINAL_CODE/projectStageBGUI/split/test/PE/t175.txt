 their kids maturity. But all in all, there’s tobacco/alcohol use, positive role models/lessons, some pretty heavy gore and cussing, but can really be a good game that deserves a different ESRB rating.
The violence isn't that gory, just very brutal.
Its way too graphic. For example: If you shoot someone the bullet hole stays there. And they bleed. Shooting unarmed women. Way too scary and graphic. Most certainly returning this back to game stop.
Any kid can play this. The violence has been exaggerated by media and your kid should play it.
Once you turn off blood and gore there are no limbs and legs flying off people. The only bad things is torture and that is very mild when you turn this setting on. The language is no worse than your child has heard in a movie or even at school. Before I bought this for my son I played it myself and agreed he could play it if he said he would never do drugs or any of that stuff. I say this as one parent to another turn off blood and gore and it is not that bad.
This game is amazing, the only issue might be the violence yet luckily there is a gore and profanity filter just in case if bloody visuals are too much, and to add on to that, this is an amazing game for people who have not tried the O.G Modern Warefare because this is the same game but with inhansed graphics and a gore filter.... Your 12 years old will love it!
Here’s what I think about COD modern warfare. To gamers, I enjoyed the storyline thoroughly. Aside from WW2, I’d say it had the best storyline yet. Sadly it didn’t include zombies, which isn’t a surprise, after all I hope we all agree that COD BO4 zombies was terrible. The multiplayer wasn’t as good as BO1 or BO2, but it was much better than the last few multiplayer COD’s For the parents, The game is extremely violent, but I wouldn’t be terribly worried about it. Because if this is the first COD they ever had played, than I wouldn’t let them play it, I would make them play some of the older COD’s (for bloody graphics) . Aside from that, the storyline is dark. So for a child’s mind it might be a little much, but for a teen, it’s not bad. Overall, great game for YOUNGER TEENS.
As long as you stay away from the campaign which is a story where you go through missions your fine. The blood in the game is barely visible and you don't see it.
This game is fine for kids 12 and up, as there is a blood and profanity/swearing option. The multiplayer is great,it opens up a whole new world in the modern warfare series. It’s fine even though it’s rated 18+ it shouldn’t be. I let my kids play this as I have spent quite a few hours myself playing the campaign. It’s fine!!
this game is not violent
