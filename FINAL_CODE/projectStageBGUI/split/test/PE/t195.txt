 flaws, mainly with its physics engine, and a few textures look incredibly bad (at least on ps4, I’ve not played on Xbox). Aside from those couple of issues, the game is great! I’m a fan of 3D platform and action games, and it definitely satisfies those areas. The games combat system is similar to Dark Souls, as it requires the player to have fast reactions and know the controls well. The challenge comes when your surrounded by a large group of enemies, as your health is relatively low, and you take a large amount of damage from attacks. The game isn’t nearly as hard as Dark Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro, but it does provide a challenge, yet still being accessible for players new to the genre. The game also shines in its exploration. It provides incentive to look around every turn and corner, and feels somewhat like a metroidvania game, requiring certain abilities to access certain areas of the map, as well as skills in the platforming department. In short, the game has some minor flaws in the graphics department, but it really excels in its gameplay , with its fast paced combat, and the joy of exploring the many worlds the game offers.
This game is a must play for anyone who loves Star Wars, or action games in general. The combat itself is fantastic, and very skill based. The story puts an interesting spin on the post order 66 story. When the game was announced, I was worried the story would be another generic Jedi in hiding story, but the game’s story is great and original. As for violence, it’s mostly standard Star Wars, but there are a few scary elements. There are undead creatures that will likely frighten younger players, and a giant spider creature that could scare people with arachnophobia (like myself), and the battles can be intense. Overall, great game.
it had an awesome story line but it has the worst physics i have ever played out of any game
it is a good game.
This game is incredibly detailed and has a compelling storyline and characters. This game has some violence simpler to the violence in the Star Wars movies. Their is only a very few instances where the word “bastard” is used.
This game is amazing, from the story to the graphics, Respawn and EA did well. Creatures can be cut in half, but no human characters are dismembered. There is no blood or gore, so violence is at a minimum. Minimal language with a couple uses of hell and one use of bastard. The only disturbing piece is that on one certain planet there are undead creatures that can be resurrected through a chant. This game dives heavily into the spiritual beliefs in the Star Wars universe, but is overall a masterpiece of a game.
Caves and dark spotss freak me out. Theese rat things comeout of the ground and attack u. I turn my brightness up to max and it looks trash bot i dont get freaked out. NOW VILOENCE
