DEATH STRANDING IS A GAME FOR TEENS. I KNOW THAT OLDER TEENS WILL ENJOY IT MORE, BUT IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANYTHING THAT YOUR TEEN HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED TO.
So the game's main premise is walking, walking walking walking. There are parts where the game is incredibly tedious and can bore the player. The game's visuals and the story is incredible. The visuals make you feel isolated on monster-infested Earth. The story also carries out these amazing visuals with the cutscenes being incredibly intriguing and fun to watch. Overall the game is incredibly boring but the story sometimes makes up for it. I still give it a 2 star because the gameplay makes the game not so great. It would be a little bit better if there were more frequent attacks from the enemies, but even when they do attack the controls feel extremely clunky and janky (same goes with the vehicles).
I personally really like this game. It's about reconnecting people together in a broken country by walking across the terrain, making deliveries to people whilst expanding a network that connects everyone together, called the "chiral network." Let's start off with the fact that the map is huge. Over 10 miles of land you can traverse through, and most of it is either flat terrain or rocky mountains. The game also features snowy mountains. The player, or Sam Porter Bridges (who you play as), also has a BB unit (Bridge Baby), which has a connection to the "other side", so it can spot invisible entities/enemies called BTs (short for Beached Things), enemies that you cannot see but they're still frightening. The game also features other enemies, such as MULEs, other humans that have an obsession with cargo (unfortunate for Sam; that's what he's carrying). These enemies have guns and rifles, however they are often non-lethal and electric. Some missions features sneaking into MULE camps and retrieving cargo from their postboxes. The game features partial nudity, which includes male buttocks. It also contains some gory cutscenes, including characters committing suicide and other gruesome acts. The story is pretty difficult to follow, and is told mostly via cutscenes. The intro to the story might feel very long, since it's just cutscenes and shorter deliveries. There is also the swearing: multiple f-bombs, s-words and other curse words are dropped. However, the role models and messages are great and shows friendship, connection, and if people are playing online,
