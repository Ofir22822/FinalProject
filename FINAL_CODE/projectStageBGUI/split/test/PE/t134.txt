 game it has little swearing (kids hear swearing at middle school and up) pretty much no nutity and some violence but it helps our son it also has good role models arthur is nice sometimes but i does have drinking .drugs .smoking but you should of taught your son not to get spend his money on that stuff when he is older
The game is violent - but only if you shoot the head, hands or legs. Sex is mild (almost nonexistent) where there is only one scene where you walk in on it. Language is what you'd expect - I heard ruder things in middle school. Only 3-4 f***s in the main story and only by the Irish who aren't a main part of the story. Let your kids have this game if they are mature enough to know they shouldn't repeat these actions.
you can blow heads to bits, sooooooooooo fun!
WARNING THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS OF THIS GAME This game is Amazing for Adults and kids! Sure there may be some Swearing and Violence but the story is amazing and well made and Much better than GTA Story (My opinion) The game requires some Maturity to play considering there are a couple of sex scenes (only shows for like 3 seconds) and there are only 3 F*** words in the story and only cusses every 30 mins. The story has a good Morale of.... SPOLIER be loyal to what matters to you. This game is also about Redemption of a outlaw named Arthur Morgan who had done bad with a gang leaded by Dutch Van Der Linde. He got Tuberculosis from beating up a man for 10 bucks. He became good and sadly SSSSSPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOILLLLLER he dies :((((((. This game teaches you to be loyal to what matters to you and no matter how much you sinned, you can be good. It is easy to play if you know the controls. There is a lot of violence and some alcohol and the good thing is the game are not money grabbing corrupt game like EA is.
Now. The violence is EXTREME. 20x worse than grand theft auto, you can do things from blow off people’s limbs to pushing them off a train. The language is barely anything. Barely any F words. Mostly just b*tch, son of a b*tch. Sex is not much except talk. There ARE prostitutes although you can only decline. You are set as an outlaw although there is an honour system. You can smoke &amp; get drunk, no drugs. 10/10 for people aged 15+.
