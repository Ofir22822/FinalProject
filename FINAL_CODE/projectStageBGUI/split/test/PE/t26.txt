 save his son. There is some sex, good amount of language, and other adult subjects but I don’t think it’s anything someone 15 or older couldn’t handle. The story is a choice game so you get to choose what happens and I think it’s unique and fun to play. It can be emotional and depressing sometimes but the story is great and realistic. There is quite some violence but i don’t think it’s too bad. It teaches people you never know how long you’re going to have someone in your life and the characters are interesting. I would totally recommend this game!
This game is absolutely amazing, great story line. However, if you feel that your child is immature i wouldn't recommend this game. There is bad language, nudity, violence and sex. This seems quite bad however all the nudity can be avoided, you just simply choose not to shower with Ethan and Madison. The sex can be avoided as well simply by not letting two of the characters kiss when given the option. If you want a certain ending you will have to make them kiss, that's all they will do and none of the sex is shown on camera. The violence is pretty much the same as most games now days, but less than games like Call Of Duty. The language really isn't that bad compared to other 15 rated games. This game does have quite a dark storyline but it is a fantastic game so if you feel your child is mature enough to play it, let them. I let my 14 year old daughter play it and she absolutely loved it. It all depends on your childs maturity and how much you trust them not to copy some of the actions. This game does have an overall good message though about seeing how far you would go to save someone you love.
Heavy Rain is an incredibly unique type of game where the actions you take are like options, where you decide to pick which of those options are the best and most wise. The storyline, plot and setting is great and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, including unraveling shocking and unexpected twists throughout. However, this does not mean it's for everyone. Heavy Rain is a very dark, psychological-horror thriller type of game which centers around the actions of the deranged and sadistic Origami Killer, whom tortures and murders young children, and it's your goal to seek justice in stopping his reign of terror and murder. This alone tells you immediately that this game is definitely not for kids and younger teens - best for mature older teens and adults. It contains sequences of strong graphic violence, disturbing and gruesome images, torture, and detailed grisly images of the killers victims. Be aware of the strong (sometimes frequent) profanity involved (uses of the f-word, gd, sh*t) and yes, there are some quite intimate and graphic sexual scenes including nudity in the game, including
