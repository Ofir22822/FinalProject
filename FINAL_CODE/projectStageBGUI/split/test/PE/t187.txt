 and obvious factor. Characters kick, punch, throw, scratch and bash each other. Animated blood is occasional but pretty mild. Characters grunt in pain and defeat. Language is mild. In story mode, use of "damn", "@$$", "p!$$" "hell" and "bastard" are heard. Sexuality is moderate. Female characters wear certain revealing clothing that emphasize their rather big breasts or butt.
One of my favorite games ever! Very good gameplay and very good story. I’ve only had it for a few days, and it’s the only PlayStation game I play! Some suggestive themes, like Laura and R. Mika’s clothes, but otherwise, very good, 9.9/10.
I got this game for £8 on steam and think that's a good price . The game uses a free to play model meaning that to unlock extra characters you have to "buy" them with fight money (the in game currency ). As far as I'm aware, there's no way to buy fight money, you have to earn it through playing the game (or buy one of the season passes to unlock it all at once). I don't mind this as I normally just play as ryu anyway and he (along with about 8 other characters) are avalible from the start. As for stuff that parents might not like, well there's punching, kicking e .c.t along with unrealistic special moves. So unless you're like my dad and don't like the concept of punching in games, then it's mostly fine. All the characters have unrealistic and steriotypical and exagerated designs (especially in female characters). But I don't think it's anything too bad. There's also online play but no voice chat (I think) and text chat is restricted to pre made messages. So while you can interact with other people, nothing bad can happen. There is some language such as from birdie, a British thug type character who will say things like "bugger" but this is only heard when you KO him i also read in other reviews that some other mild swear words (like "ass" were used but i can't say myself Inconclusion, the game is fine for everyone 10 and up (in my opinion) and possibly younger if there's an older sibling to makes sure things are fine .
This games review is pretty spot on. Many female characters are sexualized even to the point of comedy. My dad said of the character Rainbow Mika that she was "busting out of her bra" but honestly it's up to you whether you think it's too much. The gameplay is loads of fun, with new content added in updates every month in 2016. The meat of the game right now is in its online play- the current single player story can be beaten in an hour. A new cinematic story mode is coming which looks really fun. You have to be a member of PS Plus to go online if you didn't know. It disappointed me that online play wasn't free like in Nintendo games but I gave in and bought ps plus anyhow.
