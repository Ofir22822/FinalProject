This game focuses on the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It's a pretty good game overall and should be suitable for everybody "five and up". I still cannot understand why it's rated Everybody 10+ and Common Sense Media doing that as well. I never played it, but I watched the ad on Cartoon Network UK. And boxing is not really a violence.
Greatyt best

The Coolest Game Ever!
Super Cool But Surprising
Super good, easy and fun.
I was so excited, for this was my first sleepover! That was the first time I played Just Dance (Version 4). Once you start, you can’t stop. Not only is the game Just Dance 2020 worth your time, it also has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is a little high, this game is worth every second of your time. Even though the person dancing on the screen is fake, it looks real. The dancing is smooth and clear, and it doesn’t look like it was animated. The background art is exquisite, and it doesn’t glitch or look pixelated. If you like music and dancing, Just Dance 2020’s song and dances are perfect for you. The song selection is huge, over 400 songs! Although the price of Just Dance 2020’s accessibility is high, once you pay for it, you’ll find that it is worth it. If you come home from a sad day at work or at school, Just Dance 2020 will definitely cheer you up. To spend some time playing Just Dance is worth every second of your time, for it has amazing video quality and cool songs. Even though the price of the accessibility is high, the game Just Dance is definitely worth your time.
This game is really fun and can be played by anyone basically.
I really like Just Dance! Some of the songs might have "mature lyrics" but it bleeps it out! Also, there is a solution called "Kids Mode" that can help you with that! I love that I can play video games but still be active at the same time! Epic game overall, I highly recommend it!
Its a good game lets face it yes lyrics can be bad but hey! there is a solution come
