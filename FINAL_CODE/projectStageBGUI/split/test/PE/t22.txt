 Live an Avengers Adventure!
Really good game. 4 character co-op mode is fun. Reminds me of the old TMNT or Gauntlet games. A huge gallery of characters to choose from once you defeat them or reach certain levels. The violence is anything you would see in any superhero fighting game. No blood. Just knocking people over as their life status bar wears down. The main thing I was surprised by is the high usage rate of the word "hell" in the game. In names of places, items, and characters saying "What the hell..." I suppose it's considered a mild swear if at all anymore but it's enough that I don't want my 6 year old hearing it.
Cool
Games speaks saying Give Me Money!
Buy it
Unless you are willing to put money into the game to buy a world lock the game is unplayable due to the fact that you have a bunch of trolls coming into your world and causing havoc by breaking your things or setting your world on fire with lava. I just downloaded the game and got rid of it a half hour later because I got tired of people just constantly breaking my stuff and placing lava blocks all over the place. 2000 diamonds for the world lock and they only give you 30 just to get a small lock which does absolutely nothing.
DQB1 was great, DQB2 is terrible
Very Dark Themes
Great good feeling game
This game is just plain bad and I'll have a go at telling you why. 1. DQB 1 was almost an openworld game, in which you could follow the story and progress through it, while taking breaks to build your town as YOU pleased. For my kids who love minecraft this was a huge succes. DQB 2 does NOT allow you to do this. In this game you basically have zero free will and are expected to comply mindlessly in order to progress. Think minecraft, but with a Korean telling you what to build every step of the way. 2. The humour is awefull...It's almost entirely toilet humour, jokes about poo and jokes about spying on girls in the shower (lots and lots of those in different variations). 3. While the game could choose to show gender roles as equals throughout the game, it mostly has the female cast running around in playboy bunny outfits (yes litterally with the bunny ears and everything). Heck, one 'great' event is a party in which the main female does a burlesque like dance to the hooting and cheering of everyone else, while wearing her bunny outfit. 4. Considering the messages this game sends to children about women in generel and how closed minded and linear everything is, it feels like the main purpose is to teach children to do as they're told, while pushing a rather tardy view on women.
If you have concerns with allowing your child to be exposed to the dark arts, and many very dark spiritual matters, don't consider this game. On first glance this game
