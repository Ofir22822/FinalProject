 is for 15 and older, the multiplier is 12 and older.
The Multiplayer aspect of the game is fine for ages 13+ as it is like any other Multiplayer call of duty mode and does not reveal the kid to offensive or disturbing scenes, the only thing it contains is blood and simply gun violence, something that is normal for such a game and something you should expect. When it comes to the Campaign/Story mode of the game, I would say it is 15+ as it contains many offensive and disturbing scenes (some of which you can opt out on) including war crimes, torture and terrorist attacks. It shows the reality of war and puts the player directly in all of it. This could make it one of more disturbing games in the franchise such as the original Black Ops which also included war crimes and torture.
This game teaches younger kids about modern day war. The language and blood can be turned of in settings. This game should be played by people 10 and up as they will learn about the war.
The game itself if you are a COD fan is the best we've had since 2013, the feel of it is just great. This game is a bit graphic although, only in the campaign and it does give you the option to turn it off. The content when not turned off includes civilians executed point blank. dead children, one kid shot off-screen, it definitely shows the darkness of war but some people may be able to take it.
Good
Coming from a teenagers viewpoint, the story (if you want to experience it properly without cutting out any scenes or missions) is even disturbing to me, but they were going for realism. The campaign is ver real to what is happening around the world in the war against terror and it makes you think about that. There are missions where you’re forced to make very intense decisions, in one mission early on in the game, you shoot a person that looks like a civilian after they try to reach for a detonator to blow up a house that the character is in. That’s just one of the sequences, and that’s not even the worst one, maybe let little Timmy and Sally sit out on this one or find a way to make sure they only use the multiplayer which I’d say is good for about 14+.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 is a tactical shooter. The multiplayer is a fun and exciting mode with tons to choose from. Although there might be some blood if you get shot or die. (This is because the creator wanted to make it realistic). But, swearing, blood and gore can be just turned off in the settings. The campaign is quite graphic though. It displays some very dark scenes and distressing moments. But, there isn’t many of those scenes and all the other scenes are quite user friendly. I think you should only get this game if
