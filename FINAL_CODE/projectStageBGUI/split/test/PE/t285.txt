 big factor was that I spent 80 euro on dlc in this game buying loot boxes so don’t buy dlc. Swearing is almost non igsisint but when a character Called zenatta puts his damage orb on a character the use the word damn other than that no swearing. This game has lots of positive messages and role models because some of the voice lines can be very incouraging. Competitive mode: Overwatvh has a very triggering competitive mode where u are expected to try hard or try your best which can result in destructin of property or your child might get very angry. Another thing is voice chat voice chat is where you talk to strangers in ur game this can be bad because the use of language can be a very strong issue so don’t let them join voice chat. Talking to your friends while playing though is one of the funniest times in my life “mending “ with your friends is hilarious. 100 percent worth buying just think if ur child is able or mature anough to play it. Have fun and stay safe
Huge disappointment when it was suddenly just a dull and boring game instead of a ground-breaking, mind-blowing game that I was expecting. it was just a game with boring gameplay. At least this is still better than TF2 or Cs--Go
Great game. Don't think it should be 13+.
This Game is good for kids 9 and up, just make sure you go to the settings for the game, select audio, and turn off the voice chat. Mainly in Competitive mode, (but this can happen in all modes) there is lots of people screaming swear words at each other on voice chat. Some say that In game modes like Competitive you need voice chat, but i'm a Diamond Ranked player (a little over mid teir) who never uses voice chat and I do just fine. This game has a little bit of blood that splatters when you attack, but it is a very small amount of blood that often goes unnoticed. As long as you have your kid turn off voice chat, the game should be fine for your kid.
I do warn you, there are a lot of feminist in this game, big big butts and some people fantasize the characters and I do not recommend searching them, TOO MANY INAPPROPRIATE language speaking and screaming or screeching and the worst part is that kids are swearing and screaming for unknown reasons because their team is bad. I recommend reporting them immediately if you do not like them screaming at you also mute them and don't tell them you reported them for that kind of behaviour otherwise they'll salt report you back but the game itself did something about it to stop those kind of abuse but and some people hates everything here and the game is sometimes full of hackers with protesting. If you're gonna buy the game then be sure to be alert by my message who is
