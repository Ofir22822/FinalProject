Wonderful game, great story and character. It is a pretty hard game if you play it on the hard settings, which i recommend for the experienced player. When played on the easy settings it is a very easy game. Everything about this game is top notch, defiantly a game for the more intellectual player.
In the version I saw, the main characters had their weaknesses, but struggled through them to help others. Ethan Mars goes to extreme lengths to help his son, Madison Page sacrifices a lot to help Ethan, Norman Jayden gives up his drug addiction to help find the killer, and Scott Shelby goes out of his way to protect a prostitute and a cashier who&#039;s being robbed. It plays out very similar to a movie. there is a dramatic beginning, opening titles, rising action, a definite climax, and then a satisfactory conclusion. The plot is about an attempt to save a young boy&#039;s life and stop a serial killer, so the messages are positive. The content, however, is major red flag for some ages. Content Summary (NOTE: all the content below is taken from the walk-through that I watched; thus, there may be more or less, depending on the choices you make) Drug Content: Moderate-6/10 Norman Jayden is addicted to a fictional drug. He takes two trips, and is tempted to do so other times. We see him experiencing some negative consequences as a result, including hallucinations and blackouts. Language: Major-7/10 About 50-100 profanities in all. Some uses of f*ck(including a couple combined with "mother"), as well as sh*t, and other milder language. Sexual Content: Major-7/10: Ethan is seen nude in the shower(we see bare buttocks, but no full frontal nudity). Madison is forced to strip down to bra and panties by a thug with a gun. She is also assaulted by several rapists, who briefly paw at her torso(she&#039;s wearing panties and a tank top). She&#039;s also knocked out by a elderly doctor who then slowly runs his hands along her body(his doesn&#039;t last long). Shelby enters a prostitute&#039;s apartment, and she references sex, but this doesn&#039;t go anywhere. Violence: Extreme-9/10: Shelby, Madison, and Jayden gets into several brawls, punching and smashing opponents. Ethan also injures himself multiple times(we see violent wounds after a car accident and again later when he crawls over glass). There is one extended shootout, with at least a dozen gunmen taken down. The most disturbing violence includes a boy and a woman(separately)getting drowned. One man shoots another point-blank in the head(execution style). The most graphic moments are when a man is run over by a big truck and we see a blood puddle, as well as when a woman stabs an old man in the heart with a drill(he falls on her, adding to the disturbing quality).
