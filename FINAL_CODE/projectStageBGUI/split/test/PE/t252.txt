 to know how wrong I was. It's straight up disturbing, dark, brutal, too torture-some and so on that I wish I can unsee what I've seen. It questions on very, and I mean VERY heavy war topics and morals that not a lot of people will understand and just take it like "Oh, it's just a game." Not really. This COD title is very different from other COD games. It's not your typical over the top fps shooter where they're out in space or in a futuristic type of setting game no, this one shows more of reality and portray the horrors of war that can be gruesome at times, heartbreaking or unsettling. Players can make very intense decisions that it may just go over your head without thinking of the serious consequences of your actions. And there's torture. Can be very upsetting for some people. I'm not saying I didn't like it. I did. However, you shouldn't let your kid play it if they're not mature enough to handle it. It don't matter what their age is, even if you think they can handle it, I'm just saying. Don't do it. Especially if you have a sensitive child, don't desensitized them to play it. Not worth it. Maybe multiplayer mode yes, it's fine for anyone 14/15+. But the campaign mode, 18+ only!!! Seriously it takes a lot of maturity to endure and take in something. Be safe and be careful.
I have no idea why this game is 18 and up the blood is barely visible and you can't hear the swearing unless you are really listening for it this game is fine for kids with the maturity of a normal 10 year old.
This is another rehash of previous versions. Updated boards, quicker kills..same ol stuff. New campaign is the usual. A campaign for COD. Everyone knows you buy this for the multiplayer. Which the multiplayer has become a “campers” nest. More of getting shot in the back, spawn killing and parents using the game as a baby sitter. Players exploit every nook of the different maps and every shadow turning this game into something you wish you didn’t spend as much as you did.
Good game. Campaign has lots of over the top pew pew. Blood is not much of a problem this time around compared to other cod games like black ops or world at war in which you can blow peoples limbs off. Language is quite constant but its nothing worse than what your kid mostly likely hears in school or from other adults. Multiplayer is also real fun. Map selection could be better though. Great game, great campaign great multiplayer. I'm sure this game is fine for a mature tween.
Really fun game, can turn off blood, gore and swearing. I personally have my own 13 year old boy who loves it and it isn't to over the top as other Call Of Duty's can be
Fun shooter can turn off blood and swaring recomend to 13 year olds
