 is common, as well as "need a bf/gf".) There is a profanity filter enabled by default; however, it suffers from the Scunthorpe problem and censors completely inoffensive words, making communication with other players confusing at times and making it more likely a child will want to disable the profanity filter. As such, this game should be played either under close adult supervision or with people that a child knows through family, school, etc. They can create their own private lobbies and even find a way to set up a voice communication through Skype, Discord, etc. to get the full potential of the game without worrying about offensive conduct.
My son is colorblind. Game isn’t colorblind friendly. Would be helpful if he could ID based on patterns, etc not color.
Yes this game is fun but the unmoderated chat feature can be dangerous. I often play with my kids (9, 11, and 13) and one room had so much inappropriate behavior that I'd consider it cyber bullying. One comment said "suck my ****". Literally just like that. All censorship will only cover words with asterisks and many players will be creative to bypass this in chat or even their name. We were even the admin in this game and couldn't ban the individuals being inappropriate. There's discussions on "hacking" the game like this. I've also had games where players say they're 6 or 7. If you let your kids play, make sure they're ready to play with adults and teenagers. Please teach your kids internet safety.
I love the idea of this game. A simple overview of this game is the crewmates are trying to finish their tasks and figure who the impostors are, and the impostors are trying to kill the crewmates. However, a lot of people in the chat use curse words. Some only meant to express it to the game situations, but there are some who curse to the respective person saying that their ****, and etc. There is once where (my younger child) have experienced a boy asking her to be his girlfriend or something.
Not only is the online community very frustrating to even play with but they are also very toxic (meaning sore losers but in a much nastier way, like swearing). If your kid cant handle that stuff online, then just let them play with friends however online play should be rated 11+.
the chat is not the most appropriate, little bit of gore, and inappropriate names that you can call yourself. But it is so interactive though and they invented something called sus short for suspicious. I started to say it to a bit. It might get a bit addictive once you play it. But it is still a good game just if you are under the age 14 I would not look in chat because they can ask for your privacy
It depends on the kid and how well they take mature topics, the chat is not filtered so people can say whatever they want but you can
