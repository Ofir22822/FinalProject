 about the character McCree, as he is only smoking a cigarette, and you cannot even see it once you are in game. Yes, there is voice chat, but you can turn that off in settings. There is no blood, just a little red ring around the edge of your screen when you are hurt. The guns are futuristic and not realistic in the slightest. Overall great game and CSM has rated it too high on age
I've been playing for a few weeks and its really easy to get the hang of. The blood is very minimal. Yes some of the heroes have fairly revealing clothing *cough*Widow maker*cough*. Over all a great game and definitely suggest trying it.
Overwatch is an extremely fun game to play but unless you have parental controls then anything could happen. There is a lot of violence seeing as this is a first person shooter game but it has good role models and messages as the characters back stories most if the time display good things :). But sometimes swear words are used in certain characters, and sometimes there are mentions of alcohol and drugs there are some styles of characters that's have reveling clothing and some styles of the characters are super reavling especially a style if the character widow. There is a chat where kids can type whatever they want including personal information and swearing or there is a mic feature and just be careful about those as as I said anything could happen. Other than that overwatch is an amazing game but parents just set some parental controls on your console or pc or whatever just be to sure everything is right for your child. Happy playing!!
