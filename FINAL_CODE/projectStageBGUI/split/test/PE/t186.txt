 positive and talk about community and helping others. Get this game, it’s amazing and you’ll never get tired of it.
A lot of fun for everyone
Fun builder game, shows death but satirically, no blood/gore.
Love fun games hospitals this is for you
Game is very child-friendly and very fun for most ages in my opinion, game does show death and ghosts mildly, however there is no blood or gore in the deaths or in treatments/surgery/etc. All illnesses are also fake and comedic like a disease that turns you into a clown, or puts a light bulb on your head.
Its great for content creation, but might be confusing for kids under 10
its ok for gaming
Ok
Let your mind run ABSOLUTELY wild!!!
Curentley One of My Favorite Games
Don't get me wrong, dreams is an amazing game, especially with the new vr update! there are tons of tutorials where the player has to guide a cone named "Connie" to the exit to save a cube names "Cuthbert" while learning the games creation mechanics in the process, i think its good for kids 10 and up.

It is a nice game with some language
Dreams is a game where you can create some things and let your imagination control you. You are able to create levels of pretty much anything, even one of your favourite games. Violence is a bit tough to rate. During the main game, mild and cartoon violence is present. Characters have magical attacks, no blood or gore. Unlike some online content. Some players create levels with violence. There is no actual blood, players use red paint to make blood effects in the environment when making say a "horror" level. Use of "$h!t" is surprisingly heard in the demos, use of "damn" and "hell." But not frequent.
Dreams is a great tool used for creation of games, music, &amp; so much more! Sure, there can be meme stuff, (Like Shrek.) but its mainly just people being creative. Check me out! Its badj0kes2012 on Dreams.
Great for kids!
Great graphics but awful lack of content.
Street Fighter V: Champion Edition is the Definitive experience!
VERY GOOD GAME, don’t use Laura or Mika.
Ok game, not much to worry about content wise
Use your own discretion
Worst game ever
its just like a bunch of action fuigures fightning not a bad game the story mode is great and i love everything about this game
This is without doubt the best graphics in street fighter games, but the lack of effort by Capcom put into this game is astoundingly disappointing, especially in arcade mode. In arcade mode each round is only one round and there are only 3 fights in a whole character story. There are only 16 characters without purchasing( you can purchase 7 characters which is disappointing compared to ultra street fighter IV ( 44 characters). Overall the only things good about SFV are the amazing graphics and enhanced combos. It also features mild violence, language and sexual images.
Street Fighter V Champion Edition is the same game, with all the previous content in one package. Violence is the main
