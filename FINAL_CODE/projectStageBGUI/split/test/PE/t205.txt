 start the review off by saying, half of the reviews are wrong, this game is not sutibale for children under 10. At all. The mutiplayer is your standard "gun's blazing" frantic action, its bloody, punch and brutal but if your child is mature and understands the reality of war, do what you think is best. The campaign on the other hand is a grim portrayal of the true horrors of war. One mission has you playing as a young girl trying to escape after a bombing/gas attack of her home, you are forced to kill a soldier and leave your house as troops murder dying people, children under the age of 15 that are not mature will be desensitised to the level of brutality in war.. Some characters are role models in situations that feel real and are concerned about the consequences of their actions (or lack of). Great campaign though.
This game is great. I think the Multiplayer and Special Ops game modes are good for 11+ and the Campaign for 15+.
This game is good for 11 and up as I’m 9 and enjoying this game. You can turn off swearing and gore and blood in settings.
This game is very gritty and hard for me to play casually
war zones the thing I hate because ex fortnite kids are playing this now and ruining call of duty
Bravo 6, going dark
The game is great and u can turn if the gore and language
This game has a really good campaign, the only issue is that its a short campaign. Multiplayer is fun until you get matched with Campers or Sweats. Warzone is fun and much better than any other Battle Royale games on the Market at the moment. Spec Ops ain't any good, every enemy is on the hardest difficulty possible and there ain't any way to change the difficulty. This game does have Micro Transactions in it though, but you don't have to pay to get anything in the game, it's only Weapon Skins, Character Skins, Battle Passes (One time purchase until the season ends.), and that's pretty much it.
The game gives you lots to do in the multiplayer such as grinding for attachments and new guns. The campaign is not for kids and at times can be very bad for kids, there's one part where you are able to see people hanging and a hostage with a bomb attached. Warzone is fine for kids but there is proximity chat, you can turn that off though (I think) How old you should be to play the campaign: 13 - 14 years old Multiplayer: 11 - 13 Warzone: 10 - 12 (that's my opinion and the multiplayer isn't very violent, there is some blood but you can turn that off and it's nothing like the campaign, warzone is just your normal battle royale with some swearing. Blood and swearing can be turned off I believe so that isn't a big deal, campaign is a big no no for kids though and also sorry
