 bring myself to like this game. The gameplay is similar to past titles with turn based combat. "Routes" are still present but extremely linear and bland. You most likely will never revisit some routes because there's absolutely nothing to do on them and nowhere to explore. Pokemon do not interact with the environment like what you'd expect. Pokemon had never been known for its stories, but SWSH's is extremely boring. Usually I'd just skip through it, but the game babies you and the "story" seems to interrupt you every few steps of your journey. The graphics are horrid and ugly. My father had walked in while I was playing and mistook the game for a Wii game. Animations are lazy, lifeless and take you out of the simulation entirely. Overall, the game is way too easy and holds your hand the entire time. Not fun in the slightest...but fun to make fun of. I'd recommend picking this up if you're into competitive pokemon, into collecting, etc. If you're a casual fan who will put the game down after finishing, don't bother. Younger kids (5-9) may really enjoy this though!
You can be scammed when trading, can make you mad during battles when someone has an overpowered Pok?mon, other than that great. Also, names of Pok?mon can be inappropriate.
there's no gore, no violence, sexual content ETC ETC It's just not a good game. if you're a younger kid who just wants to collect pokemon and be the champion and all, this game is perfect, but for anyone who wants anything more, try another game like black and white or ORAS. they ruined "shiny pokemon" (rare special versions of pokemon that required often hours of work to acquire) by making it as simple as one person spending an hour or two, then upwards of 30 shiny pokemon being generated, and they refused to patch the glitch that caused this. the story is abysmal, the one in the previous games (sun and moon) was great! but they didn't try this time. It's also way too easy. I played through the entire game and only lost once, which would be ok if it was still a long game, but it's not. if I lost every fight it would still take me about 10 hours to beat the game, it's just way too easy. if you're looking for an easy, simple game try this one, but for a good, enjoyable game maybe go for the fan favorites, (black and white, diamond and pearl, heart gold and soul silver) or my personal favorites (omega ruby and alpha sapphire (ORAS)
Easy 2 play, beat the game in 40 hours. Highly recommend to ages 8 and up!
No gore and super kid friendly. The Pok?mon battles can be challenging, but I was able to beat them all on my first try. As long as you like Pok?mon and know how to use a switch controller, you will love this game.
This is literally the BEST video game I've ever played. Totally worth
