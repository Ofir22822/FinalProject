Until Dawn wasn’t the greatest game but it did have good characters,good actors and a some what good story to it. This game has none of that! It’s characters are dry and boring just like the story. The story doesn’t make any sense and is just plane random from the start. Don’t waste your money,just watch a YouTuber play it.
This game, man of medan, is great. Even though there is some blood, there is not much gore. There is some language, but it's no worse than fallout or call of duty. If your child is mature, than it shouldn't be a problem.
Entertaining, but loses appeal Solo (2 stars if so) due to less individual choice and consequence. The deaths (max 9 per playthru; not including NPCs) are not nearly as gory as Until Dawn but can get a bit bloody. Such as rats eating a body (though the rats haven't dug too deep yet), an offscreen throat cut with blood splatter, and a man slamming his head resulting in a large bloody pool. Others are bloodless like drowning and neck snapping. There are technically 69 total death scenes. But most are duplicates in slightly different contexts. Speaking of which, many depend less on choice and more on QTEs which is a bit disappointing. Fairly frequent language.
