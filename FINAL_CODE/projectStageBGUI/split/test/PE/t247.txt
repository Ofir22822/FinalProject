 (boys only) and some are in tube tops (girls only) Positive messages: The only positive message is that communication and team work can help you win more games, and it teaches you need to be strategic in when to go in, when to use your abilities, etc. Drugs/Alcohol/Smoking: Sometimes one character (who’s a cowboy) chews tobacco rarely. And one spray a girl is drinking wine (She’s in her twenties) That’s it. Takeaway: Great game that might be to complicated for kids under 8, and might be rage inducing, there is open chat but it can be turned off.
For me, in my opinion that is, this game is atleast 10+. Why? This game has no violence, actually no blood - there is a little blood when you punch somebody and that's it. It's a shooter game so obviously it involves guns, but this shooter game isn't as mature as others, like Call of Duty or Rainbow Six Siege. I'm 13 and have been playing this game since I was 11. It has some toxic players, but that's where you just got to mute the toxic people and move on. It isn't hard. If you don't want your child talking to older kids, just don't get a mic for them. As for 'sexual content' the only thing I can really think of it a character named Widowmaker. Her bodysuit shows some parts of her breasts, but there is skins for her that you can get that cover up those parts. There isn't swearing, atleast not horrible swearing. One character has a cigar presented in game. So get this game for your kids if you're considering it. It's very fun. To me it is age 10+, but if you are a strict parent, then maybe 12+. Just make sure your kid is mature enough! :)
I think that mature content-wise, this is the same as Fortnite. Fortnite is a 12+ so I think that Overwatch should be as well. It is a good game and very fun to play.
This game is a copy of TF2 but less bloody. Literally all 9 classes in TF2 have classes just like them in this game. Accuse me of salty but if you have seen both games you'll know what I mean.
Overwatch is a fantastic game based on a 6 VS 6 game mode with different modes within. You can do competitive play, where you can claim your skill rating to show off to other players, you can jump into a 10 minute game called QUICK PLAY, and you can make your own game of parkour, hide and seek and many more. There is a lot of violence but in a good way, as the game is good for strategy and quick thinking. You need good hand-eye co-ordination for quick reactions on the keyboard or controller. There is little language, but some heroes say "Damn", and "Hell". One specific hero (Tracer) says "Wanker" which is a politer word for asshole when she is wearing a specific skin (Punk).
