 parents have to worry about.
This game has low violence that is mostly cartoony, there is little to no blood and the only thing close to a swear word is "damn" which I've only heard four times after 49 hours of playing this game, you can also mute in game voice chat so your younger kids don't have to hear people swear or say inappropriate jokes. Overall this game is excellent and if your worried this is too violent for your child its not, just talk to them about the game after they play it and about the difference with video games and real life.
I honestly think that this is a good game for most ages. It has minimal blood, no language, and in all honesty, has a far more optimistic feel than most fps games. Overall excellent game.
