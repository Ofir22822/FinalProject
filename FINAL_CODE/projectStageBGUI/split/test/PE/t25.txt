 ages 14 and up
A game like I never played.
Heavy Rain is a game about a father in search of his son who was kidnap by the Origami Killer. He has help from his friends but its not an easy task as everyone they meet is a suspect. The story of this game is very good. The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is not too bad. Theres a DLC that's worth getting too. Although good and one of the best game to come out, this game is not for children because this game has a lot of swearing, some sex scene and nudity. Also theres a lot of violent scene and drug use. This game is not intended for children, parental guidance is strictly recommended.
The game is about your choices and the reactions other people have to them. After I played this I let my 13 year old son play and I think it taught him a lot. I think people say games like this are too mature when they are not and I think it’s appropriate for someone above the age of 12. I mean, they know what sex is, and the references are few and far between.
It depends if you are a parent alright with it
I absolutely love this game. ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Soo, if you cry easily you might not make it through this game. It's a beautiflly done story about testing how far youll go to save someone you love. It does have quite a lot of death scenes, but gore really isn't present. However, someone is strapped to a table, with a drill about to go into their hoo ha. Nothing is shown but for her beating up the dude :) THre are drugs and alchohol, because your characters with drink every now and then, and one of your characters tales some sort of drug to constantly keep his mind correct, but the drug part is avoidable. There are a lot of scenes with naked people, however, it is mainly them in the shower, but there are some sexual scenes, where Madison ( your character ) is forced to strip down at gun point ( don't worry, she beats the dudes ass ) and how two people have sex, but just legs and naked male top is shown. For the overall maturity, it get's into detail pretty quick. It feels so real when a character dies, or when someone that matters in the game dies, because it goes into detail pretty well. There are cries and screams when your son it hit by a car, and when someone cuts off their finger, they cry pretty loudly. So uhhh yeah its a great game also, check out Detroit Become Human bevause it is made by the same people. Buy this game for your kid if they are mature. A fifth grader might not be able to play this.
I think this game is amazing. It’s a story about how much length a father would go to
