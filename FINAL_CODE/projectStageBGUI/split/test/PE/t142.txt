 but it is by no means detailed and the player can save them. One mission requires you to save Arthur’s friend from hanging. This game is by not meant to be taken seriously, the gameplay is funny and I’m constantly getting sidetracked from the story and doing other things. The thing I was most worried about my kids seeing were the prostitutes in the city, but the truth is they just look like normal women and the only thing that makes them prostitutes is the dialogue, they will occasionally dialogue some may see as inappropriate. This is all just dialogue and there is no way to interact with them whatsoever, it is not even clear they are prostitutes at first. In the open world the player can choose to drink alcohol or smoke cigars, during cutscenes you can often see characters smoking. My final point is that if you child is a teen, LET THEM PLAY. Arthur is a great role model who helps people, does jobs for people and works to serve justice. If your child is any younger than 12, however, I would still let your child play but there may be certain parts that they don’t understand, as well as this the language can get quite bad at times (not the N-word like common sense included in their own review for some reason) and contains words like the sh*t, p*ss, b*stard and the f-bomb is dropped as well but not as often as other M rated titles.
It’s fun and not that bad.
One thing a lot of people say after finishing this game is "I learned so much from a man who never existed." A few missions require you kill innocent people, but while you are exploring the open sandbox western United States, you don't have to cause any harm to anyone (except lawmen, rival gang members, and other enemies trying to kill you.) There is some "bad language use" but you can hardly hear it. The gang leader is set on getting money to flee the country, so you are forced to rob stagecoaches and banks. During one mission, you get drunk and do... things. Characters are also seen smoking every few cut scenes. On one side-quest, you are walking through an art gallery and there are paintings of nude people. If your child has been to a art museum, it will be nothing. The game is very well done and I very much enjoyed it.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a new game released by Rockstar (who also made GTA). However compared to previous Rockstar games this is a baby. There is little to no nudity and the language is toned down quite a bit. This still contains violence and offensive language but this should not be new to anyone who has played other R16 games ( Assassin's Creed, Halo, Call of Duty ...) This game is stunning and everyone should have a chance to experience it. This should not be an R16 game! Thank you for
