 about listen to a parent of three kids instead of them. I went to Oxford University if you are one of those parents that says “Oh he’s just some rando.” Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has positive role models, the campaign is about a anti-terrism organization working against a terrorist. Violence- this can be switched off easily in settings. Without it switched off there are some very gory instances. Language- Can also be switched off. Without it switched off there are a few occasional f-bombs and s-words and a other cus words. Suicide bombing part never killed anyone, you kill the bomber and defuse the bomb jacket. Some smoking and drinking, but I think a twelve year old has seen people drink and smoke. Sex- none of that. I have two sons and a daughter. I bought this for my son because he said you could switch off the bad stuff. Turns out you can. I’m normally against single shooters because I saw a bunch of studies on how they affect children, but the shooting is against terrorists and you are saving people. You are told to not kill unless they are a threat. I bought this game because I love my children, if you love your you should buy it for them as well.
This game is very fun, but it is scary. There are many situations where you have to decide between your life or someone else's. There are terrorists killing civilians, and suicide bombings. Overall, its fine for anyone who can take it.
I do think this game has role models, Farah Karim is a strong female protagonist. Playing at the age of 22 I found her storyline shocking and a bit disturbing, but I can appreciate the reality of situations like hers. The entire campaign storyline was extremely violent and graphic, not something I'd want my kids to play until at least age 16.
It’s a fun a really fun game and I think if you’re child is asking for a game from the call of duty franchise this is a good game to start with
I used to be big into shooters when I was younger. The call of duty franchise was always one I enjoyed, and one that I believe mature teens or possibly younger should be able to enjoy. I've seen several parents talk about the graphic nature of the campaign/story mode saying it's over the top and extreme, which I disagree with. The campaign portrays the British and American and some Middle Eastern forces fighting against terrorist group Al-Qatala. It can be graphic at times, such as showing a terrorist attack in London. Though it may sound bad, a young person should be able to deal with this and understand the situation. It does in no way glorify war and conflict. There are several Male and Female role models in the story who play big parts in the game. The multiplayer is a classic fps, with little amounts of blood simple, though challenging combat. It is
