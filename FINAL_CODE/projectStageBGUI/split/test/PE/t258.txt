One of my favorite games!
Great Game!
Great game
Overwatch=good
Great, fun, simple. PG violence. 12+ for voice chat.
Best game ever my favorite game
This game is great, has a very small amount of blood or anything very bad. CSM has too many parent ratings, so every game that is rated Teen is always for like 37 year olds. Overwatch has tons of great characters, and doesn't really make you buy anything in game. It has merch, yes, do do most video games. There is no profanity or drugs whatsoever, and no I don't think a smoking cowboy is drugs. Another great thing about Overwatch, is just the huge amounts of people that play, so it's also a great way to make online friends(if you do that). The chat on games has never been a problem in my life, most gamers don't bother typing in the chat a lot of the time. Overall, I think Overwatch is a good game, and people should be less harsh.
The game has a bit of violence, including small splatters of blood, and revealing costumes. Good game.
The graphics of this game are phenomenal, exceeding Fortnite, Apex, and most other games in its category. A lot of people on here are saying higher age ratings because it is online and people can talk to you. However, you don’t have to be on game chat( where you can talk to other people) There is very little blood and is very cartoony. The controls are pretty easy once you play around with it for around an hour or so.
The review has 2 rating on sex tell me how a cartoon game is a 14 plus and has sex references.
overwatch is a very good game and i thint it is suitible for children 10+, but if your child is under 12 i reccomend turning in game chat off because there are alot of toxic players who seem to have no limit to the things they say, and the custom games and group finder can also have offensive or obscene titles and also be filled with horny roleplayers. The quickplay and arcade modes are just perfect if your child is under 12 because it is safe just as long as game chat is off, other than that the game is very entertaining and fun, its just the community surrounding it that is bad, and i'm also cherry picking details, it really isn't that bad.
This is the best game I have ever played although there are some chats you don't have to join them
Overwatch is a great game, there is teamwork, it is positive, and it is fun, but you have to be careful about the toxic and mean players. Like many other games, Overwatch has a voice chat option Many people will talk and
