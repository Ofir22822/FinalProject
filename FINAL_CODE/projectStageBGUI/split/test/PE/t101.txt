 No bueno.
nightmare fuel
Very cool but could be scary for younglings!
The figure of ink is too much for kids
Why does this game get such a bad rap?!
Good game
A cool game
It may be scary for young ones, but theres really nothing mature in this game
Amazing game, perfect for 12 year old kids
Awesome game, buy for 10 year old or up
Parents are exaggerating the “horrible things” that happen in this game
Religious? Probably not for you...
best!
Why do people give this a horrible review!?
pretty noice
good game
Fun!
I’m a cool laid back mama but I do have a problem with this game it’s full of bad subliminals for kids. There’s literally a pentagram thing on the wall, the characters are possessed, they rip heads off, list goes on. And I’m sorry but my son said he was a demon the other day after playing this game and that isn’t cool with me. He’s 7 and was talking about lost souls and possession. That’s not ok..............
unfortunately, this game would be OK for kids 13 and up if it wasn't for Alice angle and the satanic ritual. There is a great deal of references about satanic stuff and Alice angle. however, Henry is brave and the rebellion is to in chapter 5.
I love Bendy as it is such a unique concept. Doesn't mean it has it moments. There are a few jumpscares, but aren't that scary. There is no sex or anything like that, but there is a few uses of hell: two in Chapter 2 and one in Chapter 4, as well as a few uses of damn: Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. The main thing is the violence and creepiness. The violence includes, an axe blow to the head, a decapitation, a sword through the heart and killing ink monsters as well as lots of death. Bendy himself is a demon-like creation and can spawn in Chapter 3 a lot, which could scare younger players. But overall, isn't that bad and should be played by kids 10 and up.
Do not let little kids play. Sammy is practically satan, but is not! The other two morons rating are no brainers. Alice and sammy are just evil. I heard my 12 and 14 year old sons playing this, and, they said I should play it. Well, I did, and I got addicted! Fast! Sammy says this in a part of it. Sheep sheep sheep, It's time for sleep Rest your head It's time for bed In the morning you may wake Or in the morning you'll be dead!
I watched my son (10) play this after buying it for him for Christmas. I was wary at first as there were 2 reviews on this website calling it an 18+ game. These reviews are garbage. There's no blood or subliminal messages. The design of the game is very artistic and it's more of a puzzle game than anything. The jumpsares (there's like 2) make you jump a little then laugh. Of course it's a bit sinister but definitely not nightmare fuel.
