 explosion is so cool. I think that as long as your kid can handle killing and explosions, they would be fine.
The Game has like 2 swear words which your young kids wont even know what they are characters don't bleed. However there is a large explosive world for your kid to experiment in. Buy It Just Cause
There is little swearing with only about 2 or 3 words in the whole game. It has no blood when attacking other people. However it does have a lot of explosions. As the main object in the game is to cause as much destruction as possible. Love this Game and You will love it too trust me on that one. Maybe 7 is a bit of a push but you will know when your child is ready and my child is ready I am sure however for the average child I am pretty sure about 9 or 10 would be a correct age to play it at
It has minimal swearing (about 2 or 3 words in the whole game) and when you fight people it has little gore with no blood coming out however it has explosions. If you think your kid is mature enough to play a game like this let them play it and you will have no regrets.
It is a very high quality game and some violence however not that much not showcasing very little blood it also does not include very much swearing with about only 3 words in the whole game if your child is mature enough they could cope with the language of 3 swear words and the little gore as well as a few explosions get them this game and they will love it here in the Uk you also get a good deal at game with a steelbook edition for only £54.99 Great Game would recomend for any pre-teen 9 and up for a gift You have also got to remember the game is single player though and provides no multiplayer experience Give your kid freedom over what they play if the like the game and it is within a reasonable amount of swearing gore or violence get them it if they like it. This does not Just aply for this game it aplys for many 18s and 16s too give you kid more freedom parents
I am fine with my children playing this and also the violence is about 3 out of 5 there is one or two swear words throughout the story if you do not like explosives do not play this or let your kid play this however if your kid is mature enough then they could play this from about 9 or 10 up also if your kid has recomended this game they are probably ready to play it becuase they will know about game well.
