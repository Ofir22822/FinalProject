 assuming that hes 12 and or 11. Plus he/she has most likely defiantly heard it before in the movies. People i have noticed on this site are over praising this game i suggest buying call of duty world at war if your child has a pc and or ps3 or xbox 360. You can read my review on it when you search up Call of Duty World at War.
Not very much gore, and if you have a good boi named Landon, you should let him play
I have rated this game 15+ for violence and bad language, Violence 4.5/5 you shoot, stab, club and throw grenades to kill enemy players, resulting in puffs of blood as infantry, in vehicles you shoot explosive shots from tanks and can shoot a machine gun, the explosive kills do not have blood or dismemberment but do send people flying, in planes you can drop bombs on people and vehicles but all violence is off screen and you only know that you kill people because of the kill feed. In a cutscene somebody is shot at point blank range with a small puff of blood, you hit somebody's head on a table. Language 5/5 frequent use of f**k and s**t even online, from your character, and one use of c*nt.
Not historically accurate at all. Represents disabled women fighting in America s frontline which we know is inaccurate. It takes away the realism of previous battle fields to make it “politically correct” and not offend SJWs. As a woman I am proud to play as a man because it was them who fought on the frontlines and woman who did the equally important role of healing them, caring for the children, etc. Also , if EA wanted to be politically correct they could have touched on the great female Russian snipers who killed countless nazis and not have put their own spin on the war and still call it accurate.
I have never left a comment before but felt like I had to after reading reviews about this game from other parents who mentioned the language wasn't that bad. Or mentioned this game should be played in a classroom setting?? Just FYI - the cussing is so constant during the game (NOT from other players in chats - the actual game itself) that my almost 12 year old gave me a head's up. It is the F bomb constantly - so much that he even said it was over the top. And the C word. As far as I can tell, there is no option available to limit the language. Just thought everyone might want to know what they're getting into with this game....
