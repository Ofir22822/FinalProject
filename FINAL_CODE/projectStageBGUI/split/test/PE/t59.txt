 and intense, and demands instantaneous, skillful reactions from the player at an almost constant rate. There are methods of lightening the load, such as buffs and, most lethal, stealth, which allows the player to instantly kill most enemies, but even that can be tricky, and for mini-bosses who require two deathblows, after your stealth hit you're wholly on your own. It is a fair fight for the most part, but there are a few times, such as when you have to take on bosses or minibosses who summon hordes of enemies for you to fight as well, and those can be extremely frustrating, as there's no real skill you can employ to make it easier. In all other areas, however, Fromsoft remains top dog when it comes to things like atmospheric storytelling, incredible art direction and character design, awesome bosses, and just the absolute best music you'll ever hear in a video game. There's no cursing or nudity, and while there is blood remember that you can completely turn it off in the menu. At the end of the day Sekiro isn't perfect, but it's darn close. It has a surprisingly moving story about loyalty and honor, its visuals are breathtaking, and mastering its razor sharp combat is positively joyful. If you liked Bloodborne or the Souls games, Sekiro will not let you down, and if you haven't played any Fromsoftware titles, this is a great place to start, and you may even be better than the Soulsborne veterans without the muscle memory that they (and I) needed to unwrite in order to surmount this incredible, immensely challenging game.
