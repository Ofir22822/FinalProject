Not bad just a little violent
My 13 year old son is not allowed 18s but after a lot of research i found out its actually not that bad. I also learned that you can turn of bad language and blood so it makes it a teen rated game. So i let him install it and i watched him play and it it way better than i thought as there is actually not much gun use at all.
This Game has a little bit of swearing including the f and s word There is also some smoking and drinking but what really concerns me is the drug Factory in Columbia. If you get the free addition there is no Drug factory but that is still pretty violent. There is not much blood and I expected from the front cover for it to be gory but actually there is no gore and you can turn off blood.
Why is the rating so high? This game is just fine for kids 12 and older. The violence isnt bad because players are encouraged to avoid killong exept for the targets. The language and talk, they have heard of plenty of at school by this age. The game isnt the most fun, but my son likes it. I think it deserves a lower age rating.
Although the game has some gore, its somewhat situational, and its really not bad for anyone thats mature enough. The other references oin the game are no worse than the things that are heard at school everyday. I think that the official rating is way to high. Overall, this is a great game.
Its ok for kids the idea is cool and you can take at bad guys blood isn't too bad not as bad as Rainbow Six Seige. My Son Zach loves it and he's 11!
HITMAN 2 is a stealth game where you have to assassinate targets. There is some gore, basically just blood when you kill someone. You can go around and kill everyone, but that’s difficult, so it’s recommended to be stealthy, so you aren’t exposed to anything bad. I let my son play this game when he was 10, as he was mature, but I think that’s about an appropriate age. There is some alcohol in the levels, and also some cocaine in some missions. If your child cannot handle any drugs, you might want to wait to let them play. Swearing is rare but some light swearing happens occasionally. Five star rating for the game, 11+ age rating
Hitman 2 is not what Common Sense Media (referred to as CSM in the rest of this article) paints it as. It's not the greatest game in the world but I've enjoyed it, and it's not as mature as it says it says. I'll address some of the issues and solutions
