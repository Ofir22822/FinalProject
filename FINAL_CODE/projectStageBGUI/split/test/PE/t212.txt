Great but the campaign was to short
Great for a shooter
The campaign does carry some heavy themes that could scare younger players. Some of these things are shootings in city streets, a torture scene, and hangings. 13+ could take this type of things but younger players can not. If you yave a 12 year old who wants to play the game try to steer them toward the online multiplayer.
It really teach alot about modern ware. I now want to enlist when i becume old enof. I cant wait to show my sergeatnt my noscoping skills. I also just got into FaZe becaus i am super good at game.
Too much violence and blood. Good for children at least 15.
Im 13 and I play with so may of my friends and i can say nothing but praise for this game. the story mode has some things that you might not want you kids to see but if they are mature I think they can handle it.
It’s not bad you can turn off blood and language there’s one scene where you can interrogate a women and a kid but you can skip it. It also has great role models for kids who wanna be in the military to see the great men and women serving our country.
This game is an extremely rewarding and enjoyable online experience. The multiplayer is always fun thanks to a variety of operators, weapons and challenges to work towards. The multiplayer aspects of this game are not overly graphic at all. When shot blood spurts and stains surfaces but is not very noticeable. The multiplayer is all action with very few slow moments depending on your play style. However the Campaign is a completely different story. Infinity Wards objective is to make a realistic and brutal story. The missions though they have the same gunplay are much more graphic and realistic with various gore effects. Various missions throughout such as "Clean House" and Farahs flashback missions are graphic and upsetting. All in all the multiplayer I would rate 13+ but the campaign 15+
veary fun and veary entertaning and it has a 2 player mod
This game's campaign features very gory and disturbing imagery, from shooting screaming, helpless people in agony, to torturing your enemies for information. The campaign for that reason receives a 16+ from me. HOWEVER the multiplayer is fit for anyone aged 12 and up in my opinion. There is swearing ("f*ck", "sh*t") but
