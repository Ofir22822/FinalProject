 the gameplay is outstanding. The inventory system is designed in a way where it doesn't feel unfairly restricted, but what happens to you will be your fault if you don't manage your inventory (weapons, ammunition, healing items, key items, crafting items etc.) carefully. The A.I. of the zombies is quite possibly the best zombie A.I. to date, while slow and shambling akin to more classic, George A. Romero-esque zombies, they are still very much a threat and can put you down as quicker as the more threatening monsters if you are not protecting your very limited health carefully. Lickers are fairly easy to deal with under beginning circumstances, just walk past them slowly and they will not acknowledge your presence, but sometimes being attacked by one is unavoidable is other enemy types are present and trying to attack you. When Mr. X (the Tryant bio-weapon) shows up the tension rises exponentially as he chases you through the hallways of the police station while you try and complete other objectives. Engaging him is futile unless you have no other option as the best you'll do is slow him down, though he is less of an issue in Claire's scenarios as he is not present for anywhere as much time as he is in Leon's. I mentioned the RE Engine before as being stunning and it is. The environments and particularly the character models are rendered with unbelievable detail and with that detail comes my next point; the gore. This the most detailed gore systen I've ever seen bar the Mortal Kombat franchise, not only can limbs be dismembered or blown up, but there are different levels of injury (clothes, skin, muscle and finally bone) which can lead to all manner of grusome looking wounds. The dismemberment looks extremely real as arms can hang off a zombie for a second or two before the rest of the flesh tears and the limb falls to the ground. Hit one in the right place around the stomach and it will split in half with it's guts and entrails flailing behind it as the it will then proceed to crawl towards you. Making the head explode is the only way to truly put one down as these zombies are the definition of bullet sponges, you can knock them down, even shoot them in the head, but unless that is completely destroyed, it's getting back up. Not much in the ways of language, a few f--ks and s--ts here and there, but it's not massively strong.
I have a 10 year old son who I caught playing silent hill, apparently his friend gave it to him! I was very mad, so I made a deal with him that if he broke his silent hill disc, I would let him play resident evil(before that deal I would NEVER let him play any horror games)! Ever since he has been playing it a lot, I hear him screaming, and he has developed a fear of the dark since playing
