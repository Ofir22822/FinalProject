 highly recommend it for appropriate audiences.
There’s little to no sexual content and the worst it gets is a few f-bombs. This is fine for a 12 year old.
Over the past day I have been playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I played the first one and loved it. I could of done without the sexual themes in it though and it would not of affected me at all. I am aware that there is over 60 hours of gameplay so I do not know everything about the game. When playing the game there is lots of foul language but no more than what you would hear at your average middle school. F- bomb, [email protected], [email protected] I am ok with the language and the violence for my kid as because I know he is mature enough to handle it. I just did not let him play it at first because of the nudity. Unlike the last Red Dead and GTA 5 the sexual content is dialed down quite a bit in this game. The character you play as can not have sex with other characters at all in the game. There is cleavage shown a bit and a males genitals are shown though in a non-sexual way. There are only two scenes with a little engagement with sexual activity. During the storyline you save a woman from being raped but during the other scene you walk in on a man and a woman having sex. I believe that if your child is mature enough for this game and is 12-13 years or older s/he should be aloud to play this game. It is much better than some of Rockstars other masterpieces.
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and I gave this game a PEGI 16 age rating(ESRB TEEN equivalent). I loved the complexity and diversity of this game. The first thing I am going to talk about is violence. Violence(believe it or not) is actually not the goal of the game. Most of the gameplay is RDR2 consists of nice activities such as helping people do their daily chores, taking friends to the bar(will talk about drinking and smoking), and buying some nice and fancy clothes. When violence does occur(there is more violence in single player than multiplayer), is standard fare for an M rated game(doesn't mean the violence is low). Gunshots will not emit any blood unless you shoot the legs, hands, or heads. When a headshot or leg shot occurs it can be very brutal. The leg/head can get shot off and gore is visible. This only occurs if you are reckless in the multiplayer and start shooting innocent civilians. Most gunshots emit very little blood though and when from far there is no visible blood. The violence overall is 7/10. Similar violence levels can be found in games like Batman Arkham City, Uncharted series, and Warframe. Strong Language is rarely said. There is little to no language in multiplayer and I only heard around 4 f words in
