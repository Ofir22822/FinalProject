 It’s not as bad as you think it’s got a tiny bit of violence and language and that’s about it
Yes it has a tiny bit of violent but coming from someone who isn’t a horror expert I find it not scary whatsoever . There is no reason your kid shouldn’t play this game . To be clearly honest it has a tiny bit of language but it isn’t extreme. In addition to that at middle school everyone is swearing so it’s no different to when they are at school.
Fantastic game overall
oh my god this game is so great
As a 19 year old with a little sister. I've come to expect that each time I get a new game she will want to play it alongside me, and Risk of Rain 2 is no different. First of all, this game does have teamwork involved whenever your playing in multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, there is only online multiplayer available to the PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game, and Online and Local multiplayer on Switch. Each version has a chatbox for players to talk to each other through, and on PC/PS4/Xbox One there is also the party system that players may elect to use. I personally play on Switch, so if I choose to speak to teammates I use Discord (Nintendo really needs to learn how to do online, but that's not why I'm here, is it?) Second: violence. How violent is this game really? Not really. This game could actually pass with an E10+ rating just like the original if the ESRB didnt take offense to the presence of blood (which very rarely even shows itself.) Language: very mild, very minimal. Something that someone 7 and up could handle, no f-bombs. Lore still isn't fully written for all of the items. Is it educational? Outside of multiplayer, it's not. I dont necessarily like educational games to begin with (I didnt like them as a kid either, they where boring and I'd only play them once for about 5 minutes before booting up TF2) so I'd understand if you dont get it because it isnt educational. But I will say this, this is a really fun game if rougelikes and 3rd person shooters are your thing!!
its fast paced rouge like the original is better though
Good game for teens
This game is good for teens. You start as an ape, the goal of this game is to evolve and become a modern human. The game starts in the jungles of Africa 10 million years ago. You have a clan and you can lead them, also you have to gather materials, resources, and food to survive. There are predators and animals that you have to watch out for in the jungles.
action/anime movie lacks everything
i played this game and man did it suck to the last play. anime, i expected, was to be better not all comic-fashion mockery! i disliked almost even the comic-mockery-action-typho thingyamijig.
Sleeper hit of the year
Very mild violence for a shooter.
