 and the most basic versions of those basic ideas. After a few battles you will get tired of seeing the same stages and stage hazards over and over and over. Do I really need to see someone get knocked down Jurassic Park again? Do I really need to see the Cracken knock someone through a ship and explode on bombs again? Do I honestly really need to see street fight thugs knock someone back into the fight again? It's just very annoying to see over and over! The new songs are complete garbage, making me have unlock all the old ones again. The regular unlockable costumes are a long grind to get and aren't even that good. This game has disappointed me so much. It hasn't even been out for a year and I'm already tired of every piece of content it has to offer. Just stick to DOA5, because this game is just sad and it sucks that Team Ninja thinks all of their fans are just idiots that will give them money no matter what.
Tremendously deep
Little objectionable content, but requires a great deal of patience
Like Civ V in space
Stellaris is a grand strategy game which offers a huge amount of replayability thanks to the almost endless empire customization options, and a myriad of random event and quests. It encourages and rewards analytical, long term thinking, since most of the time you have to make multiple decisions towards an objective well in advance, as you manage your empire and its resources, be those military, social, economic, et cetera. Intellectual, curious players will be ecstatic, since the game makes players ponder on issues such as social policies and its effects on diplomacy, deep space colonization, economic development, scientific progress, and more. To an inquisitive player, many of these aspects will pose immediate questions about how these things work, and what their consequences are in the real world. I definitely recommend it to be played by kids 12 and up, since it is very, VERY complex, and many of the concepts and their interrelations might not be fully understood by a younger player.
Stellaris is an excellent strategy game, where you create and play as a spacefaring civilization. You can explore the galaxy, settle new worlds, build an interstellar society, encounter other life forms, and possibly kill them. Stellaris has very little in the way of objectionable content, largely due to gameplay taking place on a literally galactic scale. Violence and warfare is a major (and unavoidable) feature, but even if you zoom in, all that is shown is starships fighting and exploding into debris. Sexual content and profanity are nonexistent (in single player). Drugs are very occasionally mentioned, but not shown. However, this game is also extremely complex. There is a tutorial to show new players the basic mechanics, but actually mastering the game requires a lot more time. Random elements can doom a playthrough in ways that may not be visible until several hours into a game. Younger children may
