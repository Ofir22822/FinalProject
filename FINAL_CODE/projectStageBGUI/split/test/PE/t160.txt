 knives being stabbed into necks and humans found hanging from trees. Heads can be exploded when using certain guns and their headless body can then be seen on the floor. Arrows penetrating skulls, and screaming as a human is mauled to death by a wolf. Sometimes, a slow motion replay is played in which you see the bullet hitting somebody showing blood splattering. Aswell as guns and bows and arrows. An array of melee weapons can be used, like hatchets and knives. You can also hold people at gun point, and proceed to threaten them and/or beat them, choke them or shoot them. You can rob stores, trains, civilians and houses. Upon committing crimes, if seen you can be wanted by Lawman and Bounty Hounters. These men will come in horses, rifle in hand so it can be stressful to escape or fight back. Language: Uncommon use of the F word, but a very common use of Bastard and Son of a bitch. Shit is used at times. But nothing more than what a 12 year old has heard already. Nudity: Some references to Sex and prostitution. In one scene, you are knocked out and raped. You do not see or hear this, but upon waking up from being knocked out you work slightly funny suggesting something along these lines has happened. This scene is avoidable.. Animal penis can be seen. But go to a bull field and look in real life, it’s nothing unusual. Gambling: You can play Poker and Dominoes with in game currency on the line. This can be avoidable and is necessary. Drugs: 5/10 Violence/Gore: 9/10 Language: 6/10 Nudity: 3/10 Gambling: 2/10 I recommend this game for people 16 and over. As at the end of the day it is animated. Although very realised as long as you can distinguish real between fake you should be fine. However regardless of this, I do NOT reccomend this for anybody younger. The game is stressing, very realistic and all in all not pleasant when engaging in gory situations. All this aside, one of the best games ever and will engage you completely.
Firstly for PEGI the game should 100% be rated a 16 but for ESRB the game should be from TEEN - MATURE and common sense seriously don’t want any kids playing the game they are listing things that are incredibly rare to happen and the game is optional so you don’t have to anything you don’t want to. Any 12 year old would have watched something much worse whether it be a movie or even on YouTube. You should definetly let your kid play it if he’s 12+.
I genuinely believe this game is not that bad! People make easy assumptions about this game being made by rockstar and all (rockstar made GTA V) but it is nothing like it the gore is more detailed due to graphics advancements and you have less choices on being bad like your character cannot have sex whith other characters. The worst
