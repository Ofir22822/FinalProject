 out sensitive information or even physical location then switch to another lobby with a different user name within a second. If you feel like you absolutely have to let your child play this game I would recommend watching closely, only allowing your child to play in lobbies that you are in with them on another device (this is pretty easy because of cross platform play and a simple game code to enter a lobby) or having them only play private lobbies with people they actually know. It's disappointing that the creators so irresponsibly, openly expose kids by allowing free play and no account system because this can be a fun game if you find a lobby with people mature enough to play the game responsibly.
I'm 12 I played this with my aunt and her boyfriend, I used to hate this game but now I absolutely love it, now if any kids are under 10 you really should be care full because when I played SOME people like 1% of people say really nasty things and curse but you can have chate filters on

I think we should be able to report certain people not only for hacking but for toxic hosts. I have been in lobbies where I get kicked for something as small as being too good or smart, and for them being salty about them dying or making a wrong move when i was actually right in the situation. It is no fun for them to kick me and have them be satisfied when they should have to learn how to play instead of kicking someone too good, its almost like "bot lobbies" as in other games, but they just ban me and i have to wait for a whole new lobby and it gets tiring. Not only because i have to hope people will join that lobby but also because I would be doing good and they don't listen to me when i speak politely and simply confidently and they get mad and ban me for no reason because they made the wrong move.
Among Us is fun, and I can't see why it wasn't popular in 2018? It was released in 2018? Okay, lemme get to the point. The game itself is addictive, you either play as a crew mate doing task, or an impostor who is trying to kill off the entire crew to win. Only thing I'm going to say is upsetting is that adults can make it around the chat censore and ruin the game. So I'm going to say let them play it, but make sure your
