 its wailing continues, a sorrowful reminder of what you just did. The final choice I will discuss is in one of the last missions, Old Comrades, where you are interrogating one of the game's villains, the Butcher. You bring in his family, and Captain Price gives you a pistol, and the Butcher tries to reason with you, and you're forced to pull the trigger, but the weapon clicks, out of ammo. Price hands you ammunition, and the Butcher begins to talk. You're able to then shoot the Butcher(you aren't forced to), and if you do, his family begins to sob, another reminder of your wrongdoing. Besides the choices, the campaign is a mix between tame and mature. I recommend 13+ are able to play it, but the rest of the game is appropriate for 10+(if they are somewhat mature). The Multiplayer isn't that bad, yes, you may hear the occasional f bomb from the Operators, but as long as you're focused on the gameplay, there isn't the need to worry. Warzone is much the same, but requiring much more strategy than just going in guns blazing. The first time that you die in a match, you're taken to the Gulag, where you fight another prisoner for a second chance, while other prisoners watch and pelt you with rocks, this is, no doubt, the most mature part of Warzone, but it isn't as mature as the Campaign. Finally, Spec-Ops AKA Co-op. There isn't much to talk about in Classic Spec Ops, because it's mostly just a few minigames. There are many more things to talk about in the Operations , though. the Operations are very difficult and frustrating at times, but as long as you have a capable team, you can manage. The story is pretty good(I'm counting the Spec Ops story and the Season Cutscene story as one entity), telling a story of a faction comprised of two smaller factions that don't trust each other that much taking down the chain of command of a terrorist faction but ultimately ripping itself apart, leaving an elite task force to continue where they left off. All in all, Modern Warfare 2019 is a good game that anyone at the age of 10 or more can enjoy
This is a Call Of Duty game - nothing you'll see in this is different from anything you will see in any other. The campaign is using modern war events to tell a story on the horrors of war. There is a lot of death and blood. You are going around and taking out the bad guys like you do in every COD campaign. There is some incredibly dark stuff in this one though. Literal torture, children being shot, children fighting soldiers. No one under the age of about 14 could probably understand and handle what it is putting out. The multiplayer is a different story. It's the basic mindless arcade shooter that we all know. It's probably good for any one over the age of 10.
