 Had to ask for a refund
May contain violence and some words to look out for. BUT ITS A GREAT ADVENTURE!
Weak plot, great gameplay
There is a lot of swearing and naming of Jesus's ame in vain (as another swear word). I waited for a year to buy it for my kids and sadly we had to take return it after discovering that "coarse lanhuage" meant blaspheming as well.
I think this game is very good it has an awesome story. The game is about going on different missions with a fighter jet to save to stop the war. The game is good on the story details and graphics and music rhythms for each mission. 5 stars! Watch out for swearing, and excessive violence.
Game is pretty difficult, but extremely rewarding to play. Despite some...inaccuracies (*cough* having over a 100 missles on a plane *cough*), there are many great mechanics keeping the game fresh to the end. Clouds mess with missle tracking and ice your plane, wind can throw you way off course, at one point IFF system changes, forcing you to scan every target before letting you know if they are an enemy or not. The plot is lacking hovewer. There are several big plot holes, pieces of incoherent dialogue and bits where you have to actually sit and think about what even happened. Also, it strongly assumes the player having considerable knowledge of the game's universe. In short, the plot is more of a nostalgia hook than it's own thing. In terms of "inappropriate content", there are only two major moments coming to my mind. In one, an antagonist chases your ally, but not killing her until she has a complete mental breakdown from fear. The second one is subtler, it has your AWACS tricking your ally into executing another one for pretty much no reason, other than personal dislike.
Fun for the whole family!
Very fun
We recently finished running through this title with our 4 year old. This version of the game introduces the new child friendly character Nabbit who is immune to nearly all enemies in the game. This allows this game to be more approachable to a younger audience. Playing in tandem with my wife and I created a very enjoyable play experience. All the themes and characters were approachable for a 4 year old. Highly recommended!
This is the best version of Super Mario Bros I have ever played. And I have played it on a Nintendo 3DS and a Wii U. This is like the updated and better quality version of the original 1996 version of Super Mario Bros. And I think everyone knows that Nintendo Switch games are CRAZY expensive. I would not say it is worth the $60. Especially since you can get the game on a DS or Wii U for $10. This is a family friendly game. For all ages.
Under 6 controls are hard to learn
