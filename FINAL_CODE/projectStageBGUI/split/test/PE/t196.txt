 IS DIFFRENT u slice a set place of a animal. stormtroopers just die.
This is a ridiculously well-made game with amazing, realistic graphics. There is no inappropriate content whatsoever, and the Jedi (and republic) characters are strong and care for each other. Once you reach this island when you are trying to get to a Jedi temple, there are some monsters that I think anyone 10 or under will NOT like. They have three bright orange eyes, move in a weird curling way and have teeth and fangs on their tongues. The violence is fine, there isn’t any blood, but there are constant enemies you will have to kill. This is an action packed, beautifully made (it is totally worth the price) game that I would recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or not. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t seen any of the Star Wars movies to play this. Thanks for reading!
I thank it was a good game. Because this game was great they don't have any bad thing on there. just a little. that was fine.
This game is about as violent as a Star Wars movie is. It has its battle moments, whether it be stormtroopers or battling other people with lightsabers. There is no dismemberment while fighting, and fighting scenes don't even last that long. Overall, great puzzles, awesome story, and amazing gameplay. I would put it at 10 and up for kids that can handle mild realistic violence. But definitely nothing over the top.
Uncharted for Children
It sometimes chops out alien/robot body parts so it changed my rating from E to 8. It does not have nothing inappropriate whatsoever. This game unlike other Star Wars Games has parkour with an Uncharted style into it, I would say it is an Uncharted for children. Really good game.
Rated 15 (strong language, threat, violence).
basically just cutscenes and walking around
NO WAY. THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE 13-DEATH WE PART
Incredibly Dissapointing
Really good action game mixes great role models and messages with suspense and stealth.
SEX/NUDITY - Some mild verbal sexual references, and moments of natural nudity (mainly buttocks). VIOLENCE/GORE - Moments of moderate violence occur throughout, where the main character must knock out enemies to progress, or where enemies attack the main character, although violence is not the primary focus of the game. There are also scenes of fantasy violence where fantastical creatures attack humans by dragging them under a tar-like liquid or consuming them (these scenes are more scary/intense than violent). PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck") and other milder terms used throughout the game, though not excessively. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Occasional drug references, where the main character is asked to deliver packages which contain "drugs". Although the "drugs" aren't exactly specified for what their uses are, there is brief mention that they make people "happy". There are also occassional scenes of alcohol consumption. THREAT/HORROR - Sequences of strong sustained threat and moderate horror throughout. These involve intense and suspenseful moments where characters are menaced by almost-invisible supernatural beings. There are other moments
