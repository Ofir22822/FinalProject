 Every level is the same boring euro city block or boring interior. Enemy and weapon variety is hardly existant and there are almost no gory kills. Not even the primary flamethrower causes any burn damage. The hacker interludes are boring palete cleansers for an already bland main course. Stick to Doom VFR which has way more of everything.
Good game for mature teens and tweens
What a waste.
The game has great messages it does have guns but manny games for 6 and above have guns there is a small amount of swear you would see in a pg13 movie also there are bars no sex
Awful progression with unnecessary RPG elements that severely dampen the gunplay, bad and boring level design, poor netcode, Bethesda's signature buggyness, and top it off with the most obnoxious and unlikable characters in a video game since Duke Nukem Forever. The only good thing is the introduction of a multiverse which gives hope of another reboot that could fix the catastrophe this series has become. Super gory as usual.
Excellent game. One of my favorites!
Awesome!
Great Strategic Game!
This is an excellent game that requires critical thinking and planning. My biggest complaint is that the "effectiveness" of the teacher/instructor you play in the game is based almost solely on how much you pander to what students want to hear. The students are older teenagers (then, later in the game in their early 20s) so there is a fair amount of mild flirting and references to some of the characters being promiscuous and one of the adults drinking too much. For the most part, the game's violence is pretty tame. Characters are seen using weapons against enemies, but the gore is very low. The exception are a few of the key cut-scenes which are pretty gratuitous and visceral. Because of the strategic leveling up of characters/units, I would find it surprising if players under the age of 13 could finish this game. I would also mention that none of the paths through this game are unproblematic; they all require being complicit to some degree with what may be seen as poor ethical judgement for "the greater good."
Awesome strategy game, good for most ages!
Great game, needs strategic mind to win, one of the better fire emblem games!
Rated 15 (strong violence, threat, language, bloody images, suicide references, sexual threat, horror, drug misuse).
I know a lot of people have already said this but if you child knows about the game it’s probably ok
I know another review said this
If they are old enough to know about it there old enough to play it
A bit of violence
No worse than a typical DC/Marvel superhero movie
Don't let kids under 18+ play this.

An EXPERIENCE filled with tears and jeers.

Beyond Two Souls
SEX/NUDITY - There is some sensuality and passionate kissing in one scene, where two characters make out on a bed (no nudity). One scene gives the player the opportunity to go into a back alley with a man to perform sex, in order
