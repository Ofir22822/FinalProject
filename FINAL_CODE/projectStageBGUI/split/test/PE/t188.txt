 is good:The game has good graphics. What's bad: For starters, I find the game really hard to play. It is just so difficult to use special moves. In addition to this, the move instruction manual is completely hopeless.I only figured out how to use a 'HADOKEN' 30 min into the game, plus, the 'easy' setting doesn't make a difference. last of all the characters make really unrealistic and actually quite creepy noises when they are hit. Please don't get this game. I am only trying to save your money. Complete waste of money.

I'm the biggest Star Wars Geek out there and of course I got to play this game. The story is amazing and the graphics make it look like its a live action movie. Some parts are a little mature. Such as when you go to Dathomir and are sent to fight against undead witches and demon looking men. Some special moves are shown slicing troopers or stabbing them but never taking the body parts off! Highly recommend it if you or your child is really into Star Wars
Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order is probably the best Star Wars game ever rivalling Star Wars battlefront II (the original) and Star Wars Kights Of The Old Republic. As you play through the story you will experience lots of twists and turns to the plot and some exciting boss fights. I recommend that if you do get this game, you should go off to explore and find secrets. The game has thoughtful and challenging combat using a lightsaber. None of the combat is particularly violent, occasionally you can slice creatures (no humans) lims or intire body in half which may be too intense for younger children. There are also some dark story themes to it. The main ones being a main character going through torture and a witch bringing her dead sisters back to life using powerful rituals. Overall though this game is fine for anyone aged 13+. Great game.
this game is utterly amazing the graphics and the story are out of this world hours upon hours of play with this game. The does include fighting but no blood or anything along those lines are shown the game is great for kids that want a challenge the fighting mechanics can be hard even for long time gamer's like myself but practice makes perfect and this game has a lot of room for trial and error so dont be afraid of losing great for kids 8 and up and would highly recommend this. No swearing,
