 10-12+ rating plus only some swearing
This game is without a doubt, the best hitman game in the franchise. Should kids play it? Depends on the kid. There Are some dialogs from NPCs that include swearing. If your kid is able to handle snapping necks, dumping bodies and other creative ways to eliminate your targets, he/she can play it. Also there is missions that include stealing joints, and breaking into a drug factory.
hitman and hitman 2 are teen ready there is a few times where they lead drinks wine but unless your kid does not know about it it's fine
Depends if your kid can handle violence in video games and movies GO FOR IT!!! There is a bit of swearing but it’s not a lot.
Love this game and it does have violence swearing however if your child is 10 or up they will have heard all of these before at school there is no sexual content in the game great game and definitely consider buying it for your child if they are mature enough Common Sense Media rates everything to high don't listen to them
I think the game is great nothing really bad about it all tho the game is a little violent. But the violince is not as bad as the rest of the stuff you see now so consider before you buy.
