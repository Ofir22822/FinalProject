 No hardcore violence an great fun for star wars fans
its a good game there is no swearing(some violence)but not that much of violence it should be 12+ i liked the game it was fun and i also think that pegi is NOT always right so i use this website to see the ratings of parents and kids, sometimes pegi exaggerate. at the end i want to thank common sense media and parents. and thanks to EA and RESPAWN ENTERTAINMENT. THANK YOU ALL.
I guess it's Ok? I got stuck on one part a year ago and stopped playing but IDK...
It's a good game there is violence but it's a star wars game so what do you expect there is lots of parkour and but after you finish the game it gets boring so it was fun while it lasted!
This game is really good. The story is really intriguing, and there is a nice learning curve for the gameplay. For Star Wars fans, this game is a really fun expansion to the universe.
It doesn't matter if your into Star Wars or not, you have to play this game!!! Jedi Fallen Order is an action adventure game with a captivating and intriguing story with a sense of mystery and being part of something bigger. It has some of the best graphics, level design and storytelling out there. The only problem is that it doesn't have multiplayer, which isn't even that big of a critisism! Just go and buy it, now!
This game is beautifully crafted from both a star wars cinematic universe standpoint, and just as a game in general. The story is engaging, very elaborate and overall expertly crafted like something from a tv series. The fighting sequences are amazing as well. as for violence, this game isnt really that violent. I know slicing people with lightsabers would appear to be violent, but the violence isnt glorified in any way (as the main character is fighting for peace) and the battles arent too intense either (theres no blood or gore really). To be honest, thats really the only thing that would constitute concerns parentally and there isnt much else weighing on this brilliant game. Overall, as long as you think your kid is mature enough for the mild violence in this game, i think it is a must-purchase for star wars fans!!!
The game's storyline is impressive, although at the beginning at the game there is some profanity. There is alots of peril and the use of H*ll and b*stard. There is no dismemberment like the other games. The story is not finished though. Enemies will discourage you and insult you.
I have completed this game twice and it is my second favorite star wars game of all time!(Behind Battlefront 2) I dont know about the T rating by ESRB. The worst thing in this game is dismemberment. Not human dismemberment though! Animal dismemberment. And even so the violence is not bat at all. I think it's fine for anyone 7 and up. Please pick
