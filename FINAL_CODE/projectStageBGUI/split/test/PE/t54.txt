 left for dead or feel to it messed with Warr aesthetically has the left for dead it feel to it But with that world war Z vibe aesthetically if it was more like left for dead with that first person perspective it would’ve been a whole lot better the game doesn’t handle real well when you AT but with that world war Z vibe aesthetically if it was more like left for dead with that first person perspective it would’ve been a whole lot better the game doesn’t handle real well when you ADS It’s real wonky I was just really disappointed I had high hopes but I was like damn that’s just my perspective on the game the graphics are good but third person gameplay for this style does not fit
Blood and Violence. It’s a really fun zombie game. The leveling system is great too! Within the campaign, there are female mannequins / sculptures with bare breasts and nipples.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney
Great Game. A tiny bit of adult content but overall teaches people about law.
It's okay
It seems cute. I thought it would be a bit more challenging. While taking turns on it with my little guy it seemed too easy. It might get harder and maybe I set it to the easiest difficulty settings. However, of the games we have, I don't see him playing this one much.
Good for people who love strategy
Is Assassins Creed 3 Remastered Violent?
Assassins Creed 111
This is awesome!!
This game is so good
Can turn off blood
Good game for mature kids
As a parent at first I wasn't enthusiastic about this game. Me and my son agreed that I would let him get the game as long as he would let me watch him and he would return it if it was too violent or inappropriate. I watched him and I found out of a feature on this game that Common Sense Media completely ignores. You can turn of blood for the whole game. I watched him play and without the blood the game is completely fine. If your child has seen any of the new Marvel movies and it didn't bother them then I would say he can get the game if they turn off blood because the violence without blood is exactly the same as those movies. If your child has seen those It movies the one the clown then they're definitely fine for this game with blood and without blood I guarantee it will be fine. The game isn't as bad as people have said. This game is truly fine for people even if they're mature 10 and up. Also it's a great less violent alternative to Odyssey which is the one that takes place in Greece.
I think you should not give every m game an 18+ my 11 year old child loves the game but never curses. It has a few rude words that you should never call something or ever say but my child handles the responsibility well.
I think the 18+ rating is
