 very fun it is fun to create things and the fighting is good some swearing and blood but you can turn blood off
Nice WWE!!!! One of the best!!!! I used to watch my cousins play it many times!!!!! Lovely game!!
I bought this game about 1 week after it came out, and I liked it, but I had to pay 14 dollars for "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt, And there is an option to take off wrestlers' clothes in the edit a wrestler option, the graphics look like something from a PS3 game, and there is too many glitches.
This game is good but it does have some stuff your kids should know. There is a little blood but that can be turned off. Story mode is just not appropriate. Such as someone being called "A**wipe" and other cuss words for story mode. It even involves you have a dead person's ashes being blown on you and you even swallow some of the ashes. And there is some more creepy stuff in story mode. Regular play is just fine. Do not go to community creations to download images, because they can include inappropriate stuff. Another thing to talk about is the clothing options.The game allows you to make female superstars fight in their underwear. There are not many great messages in the game. You are allowed to insult people in universe mode. If i were you, i would let kids play default mode at the top of the options mode, but not story mode.
Alright so typically I love these WWE games and think they are amazing, but not 2k20... This is an unfinished game that WWE should have released 2 weeks later than they did. So I pre-ordered the game before any info came out, then I start hearing negatives but they always talk about the bad. Well this time they were right and I wasted 129.99 on the Smackdown Edition of it. So once it loaded I realized the controls were different (which I don't really mind) epecially the reverse is now "Y" instead of "RT". Now another thing which is a downgrade in my opinion is the glitches and there are a lot of them, first there is a glith where a team would still be in the ring during a superstars entrance, a glitch in some cases where a superstar with long hair would have in go in the body disappearing, and many more of the glitches where a cpu would not move. Now this game is very disappointing and the only good I have for it is that there is a good selection in the character suite. Overall 2/5 for a very disappointing game (hopefully 2k21 is better).
The games graphics are better
It is kust like other wwe games.But a little harder to play.You see,They changed tge controls and that might be harder dor old players or possibly new players.The online community creation can expose you to other creations people have made which could be innaproprete.The online play you can
