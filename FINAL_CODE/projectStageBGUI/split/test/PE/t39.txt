 parents to have to explain to kids.
Violent but Heartining
While the game can be violent at times, overall the characters are children trying to survive in horrific circumstances but they are adapting to protect each other. They are good role models and there is no moral ambiguity.
Polished and unique shooter mired by over the top language & sub par overworld.
Its great
Great Game! Parents please read! This game is ok for Tweens and kids of older age!
The team who made Doom created this world which will give you an idea what to exspect from the shooting mechanics as it is a copy and paste kind of scenario from that game to this at it's core. The story and cinematics are cartoonish and almost laughably generic, but the basic gameplay is fun enough with some tagged on gear management, upgrades and some special abilities to aquire like a super melee and ground pound. Vehicles, an open world and racing are thrown in as well to make it a varied adventure, but the shooting parts seem to be where you prepare yourself for while these other elements sometimes feel like fluff to get to the good stuff of "killing baddies". The pace can be sluggish as you traverse the world and perform tasks for leveling, but the unique gear you can receive and build makes for an interesting, if not slow way to be more involved in the preparation process to take on new challenges, which can most often be done in whatever order you choose once you get some tasks under your belt. Survivability in this game can be frustrating as there is no health or shield regeneration and you must either carry very limited supplies or gain health pickups from the environment or fallen enemies, the latter of which disappear after a short period. The good is that you can take the game at your own pace, the bad is that the overworld map is not very user friendly or clear and you will find yourself trying often to discern what to do next, and this problem persists even moreso in the towns you visit as there are no real indicators as to what's what and you are left on your own to figure most of it out yourself. So, hence the mixed reviews, the tone of the game is kindof all over the place with a mish mosh of different settings, towns, activities etc, but this is not just a shooter as there will be quite a bit to accomplish between gunplay levels. Considering all this, the language in this game is often overtly sexual and and as gutter mouthed as it gets. Especially with the over the top weapons you can aquire later on can be enticing for younger players to want to pick this up (being one of the major advertised selling points), but they will be exsposed to the filthiest of language in the process. They can say it's for immersion into the crazy post apocalyptic world, but
