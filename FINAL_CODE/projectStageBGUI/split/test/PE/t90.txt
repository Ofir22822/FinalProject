 comes out of them. The violence happens at long range so you wont be able to see it up close. There are also finisher moves but they are either just stabbing someone or shooting them. When you are shot your character grunts and your screen goes a bit red so you know you have been shot. ALL VIOLENCE CAN BE TURNED OFF. This means that your child wont see any blood or gore. There is in-frequent swearing using words such as the f and s words. Overall, with the blood and gore turned off, it would be sutible for all people age 14 and over.
Amazing. There is aload of swearing but it’s battlefield language, nothing worse to what children will hear in schools. The gore isn’t extreme but can be at times. 10/10 for ages 11+
This game is trash .They took out the helicopter in plunder.Took the fun away. When I bought this game it had helicopters. Now Ithe game is less valuable to me. I hate it and am erasing it from my PS4.
CSM definitely went a little overboard with their review. The game is violent and brutal, but it isn't terrible compared to other things. I think the violence is more in terms of context. For example, on one of the missions you are dealing with a terrorist attack on London, and you come across a man with a bomb vest strapped to his chest. The timer begins to run out, and there's really nothing you can do for him, so one of the other characters from the game pushes him off the edge of the building. You don't really see anything, you see him go off the edge, followed by an explosion. It's violent because of the fact that you couldn't save an innocent man who had children (he pleads for you to save him so that he can see his children). Overall, the game isn't very bloody, and if you want to you can turn all the blood and dismemberment off in the settings. I think more mature teens can handle this game, but it's definitely not for anyone under the age of 14. In terms of quality, it's a very great game with smooth controls and a fun and suspenseful campaign that I think anyone will enjoy.
