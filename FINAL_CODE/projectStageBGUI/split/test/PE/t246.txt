 to overwatch. If your kid’s behavior is changing just limit play time, don’t blame it on the game. This game has a very minimal amount of in game purchases.
Overwatch is a futuristic first person shooter with positive role models and messages with little to no blood. I bought this game about two years ago and had great fun with my mates. There are more than enough gamemodes to keep you interested, you can have a good time playing custom games and creating them yourself. I stopped playing this game about a year ago because the community can be very toxic sometimes and some players who you play with can be very aggressive. You can also buy in-game loot boxes which are incredibly overpriced. Please do not waste your money on them!! But overall a great game with some flaws.
I love the game overwatch! It is an online first person shooter, however, it is not as violent as other FPS games such as call of duty and Doom (2016). There is minimal blood however it is a lot of violence. There are guns and you half to shoot at other players but that is not the point of the game. The point of the game is to capture the objective and keep that objective until the end of the game! There is mild language, a character will say d**n occasionally! Other than that this is a great game for teens! Side note: You should turn your microphone off because some people will get very angry.
It is a really good game that shows diversity through race, gender, sexuality, and body type. The characters are very good! There is the rare 'damn' from a character, which isn't really a bad word. The game play is simple, and can be fun to get better at. There are some skin tight suits, but that is in all super heros (marvel and dc) The only thing that you should do is mute voice chat for your kid. Let them play with friends on vc, but never with strangers. Sure there are nice people, but it still can be very toxic. I've avoided people and I really like it. Also monitor what your kid sees in the fandom. There is cool art and comics but also... you know... stuff. But its not the same as playing the game
The whole point of the game is to be in a 6v6 where you have to attack or defend points, payloads, or hold a point. In colorful maps and loads of vibrant customizable heroes with there own unique skills, it is truly a wonderful game (sometimes rage inducing) that can make you say “hey, where did the last 5 hours go?” Violence: The only shred of violence is when you kill a character, tiny cartoony drops of blood come out. That’s only it. Language: Sometimes the characters will say “damn” every once in a while. It is open chat, but you can turn it off. Nudity: Some characters are shirtless
