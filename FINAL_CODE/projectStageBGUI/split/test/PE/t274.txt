 game, I'm not going to lie. The best thing I can recommend for parents is to let their kids only play it a couple of days a week. Some characters could scare younger children if they are like 7 year olds because some characters have weird voices and can look slightly scary. I would totally recommend this game for pre-teens/teens but you must know that if you have a head set or a microphone people are able to speak to you and even if you don't you can still hear them talking. Just don't reveal private info and you will be fine! This game can teach you about team-work. The guns aren't violent looking but look very futuristic, that is the base of the game, looking like the future
Overwatch is a great game for people just getting into first person shooters (fps games). I think this game puts out a really good message that you can do anything if you work as a team! The game does not have any gore at all, but you do have to shoot people but with thing from bows to ninja stars etc. Even though this game has violence it is very cartoony so it should be fine for anyone age 11 and up!
For a start, it's an amazing game. But there's blood. Not exactly but you see a puff of red when you hit somebody. Plus, there's red around your screen when your at low health. Apart from that the game itself is awesome. You just gotta be quick when choosing characters or heroes as there can only 1 hero in each game. It's available on pc ps4 and Xbox but is pretty costly.
cartoonish realistic violence makes this game very kid friendly, also the fact that its easy to learn how to play, although, i think that the competitive side of it makes it less so and brings out the competitive nature in children. Moving on to the lore, the game has great role models as one character is a lesbian, another character is a really strong woman and a peaceful robot healer/monk overall, i believe this is a great game with great role models and ease of play
