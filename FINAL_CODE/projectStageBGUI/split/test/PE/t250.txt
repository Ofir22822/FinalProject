 a really fun game with hardly any blood and violence. If you want to play a shooter game that is appropriate, then ask your parents to play Overwatch! There are also special abilities that makes the game really unique
Overwatch is a great 3D FPS Shooter. It is great fun to play especially when you are in a team! The game is 90% team play. It encourages it alot which is good. The only thing that someone may see bad (I don't really know how as it's extremely mild.) When you are on low health there is not so realistic blood around the screen and some characters have tight suits (I dont see this as a problem) Any kid over the age of 7 will see the violence is purley SCI-FI. There is no other blood.
Very fast pace game with lots of violence (no blood) e.g. later guns, pistols, maces and many more weapons. Has an open chat which will help you win with communication. But no that bad in terms of violence.
This is a great game I mean I love it I’ve played it since I was 10, it’s fine guns are bad but this is animated it doesn’t even look real... this game would be good for a 10 year old if they were mature but if they’re not by 11 it’ll be fine for them, the reason I say this is the overwatch community is quite toxic and can get a little mad when you lose a competitive game but you just gotta move on. In conclusion this game is really fun and parents if you’re not sure just try it for yourself.
This has been a defining game of the 21st century. While the game didn't blow up quite as much as Fortnite, I has been able to maintain its high popularity for 4 years. Overwatch is a team based FPS with an open mic. Before you join a server, you pick what type of player you can choose when you enter the match (attacker, tank, or healer). When you enter a game, you select your character of choice from the options given to your class. There are several game modes, but most of them fall under these categories: king of the hill, escort the payload, and team deathmatch. The violence isn't bad in the slightest, when players die they disappear and there is no blood or gore when a player gets hurt. The reason I rated the age for 11 and up is because of the hot mic. It is open voice chat, like if you've ever played teams in fortnite, and people can pretty much say anything they want to. This could scar some younger children for life, so I recommend turning off the microphone feature and muting other players if you are a parent of a younger child. But other than that, it is a very good game that has so many different character options that it is hard to dislike the game.
