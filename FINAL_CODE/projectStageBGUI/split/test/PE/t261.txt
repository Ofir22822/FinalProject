 game. 20/10
The game I will be reviewing today is Overwatch, a first person shooter game made by Blizzard. In this game it is a 6 vs 6 in a random map, there 31 unique characters you can play as. There are 3 modes, payload where a cart needs to be escorted, capture point where there are 2 points you need to claim/defend, and finally control point where there is 1 point and you have to control it for a set amount of time. This game’s cost varies, I bought it when it costed $60 back in 2017. Now it cost $20 for classic $40 for origins and $60 for legendary, the more costly versions just give you more cosmetics but is the same game, and are not worth the extra money. The game has a wide player base, and lots of people spend hours upon hours on this game. Some characters take no skill to play but wreck everyone like Baston, Mei, Torbj?rn, Sombra, Symetra, Reaper, Widowmaker, Sigma, Moria and Baptist. Overall I think overwatch is a great game and you can play on computers or on consoles. You can connect with people from any device and you get the same exact match. It is a great game and now only the low cost of $20. When overwatch 2 was announced I read about it for a while and it can still play with people from overwatch 1 on the same server, speed, and gameplay. 9/10 would recommend.
This is probably one of the best games of all time. There is no sex, if you don’t give your kid a mic, then he/she can’t talk to other people. McCree, a cowboy character does occasionally have a cigar in his mouth, but he never vocally promotes it. Some of the characters Occasionally say the words “dammit” or “what the hell”, but i play this game a lot and have only heard it a couple of times. As for the “blood” when you are on really low health a red ring appears on the edges of your screen to notify you that your on low health and the blood is nonexistent if no one had told me there was blood I honestly would have never noticed. Most of the characters are not only heroes, but promote heroism. One of the characters is literally a hamster in a giant robot hamster ball. A couple of the hero’s are lgbt. This game is so much more kid friendly then call of duty or any other famously violent game. This game promotes team based skills, helps reaction times. Before I mentioned some of the characters are heroes, for example Winston, a genetically modified super smart gorilla. But some of them are bad. For example Roadhog and Junkrat, two Australian guys who went mad after the Omnic crisis in Australia. Most of the gun are not real life guns. I think only 2 out of the 31 heroes have realistic guns, and ones a sniper and the
