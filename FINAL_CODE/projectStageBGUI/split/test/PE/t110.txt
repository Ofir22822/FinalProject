 Even though it has violent weapons, I think it's 7 and up because it includes teamwork,survival,and fun. That's why I think it's 7 and up.
Somewhat repetitive game that's too easy to cheat in.

Best Game EVER!!!
Not for the innocent
Appropriate for almost everyone
It's a really good game, altho some players might use foul language but hey that's the internet. Apart from others players using profain it's all good. Oh and let's say someone uses the f word it would be writing like this **** . Or maybe ****ing b****(the f word and b word). Yeah something like this and some people dont wanna see that
The game is alright with friends, but don't go into public lobbies. Not because of the chat, as that can be censored, but because of the cheaters. Hackers are only a very small problem in this game, but normal 10 year olds cheating ruins the experience for everyone. In terms of being inapropriate, there are a few iffy kill animations, but nothing an 8 year old can't handle, and also online chat, which can be filtered, but be cautious just in case
So, I see a lot of parent reviews saying this app is 14+? Like really? I'm 15 and I actually play this game with my parents and my younger siblings . Parents need to clam down on the chat feature like teach your kids to report people and ignore chat. Parents saying violence is and issue? If you watch your kids watch superhero movies you should have no reason to speak about the cartoon violence. I personally love this game and recommend to parents to let their child play!
As I played this game to see what it was about and make sure it was safe for my kids, I was proposition for sexual activity. I was asked for outside screen names and contact info by others players to have a more private chat. None of these were advances made by me. The people who were doing it were just asking everyone for their info. Sadly, there were children, girls and boys, giving out their information to complete strangers to contact them. Not only grown people preying on younger children but also saying inappropriate explicit sexual activities just in the chat. They would pop in a chat and start talking inappropriately and keep doing it until they were kicked out and sometimes, other players would join the text. Although this is such a fun game to play, it will expose your kids to things only adults should be a part of and also put them in a position to be preyed upon. The good part is they do make
