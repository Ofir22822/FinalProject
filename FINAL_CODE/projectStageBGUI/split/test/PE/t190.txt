 this game up for your kid!
Not a pegi 16, no idea what that was about, suitable for any age but might be a bit complex for younger kids. Someone was waffling about witchcraft in the game, I mean, grow up, witches aren't real and we burnt lots of innocent women by pretending they were. So unless your silly enough to be scared of 'demonic forces' in the game, I suggest you buy it immediately.
Here is my Ratings Violence: There is loads of violence, you can impale people with your lightsaber and smash them into the ground. You can also slice them across the waist causing lightsaber slashes to appear on them. With the humans here is no blood or dismemberment, however you can slice creatures in half and even cut their head’s off in some places. Sex: none Language: They use hell sometimes and the word Bas***d is used once in a cutscene Positive Role models:: with an excellent story and Cal as the main character there are lots of positive role models in the game Fear: there is menacing music and in a cut scene a woman Jedi is tortured by the empire but a black screen covers most of it up Amazing game with a brilliant campaign but definitely not for younger kids!
one of the best games ive ever played. really addicting and fun although there are some very hard parts that get you frusturated so would not recomend for non serious gamers
this game is great! there is of course fighting, but no blood is actually shown. there is little swearing, with only moderate levels. great for fans of star wars.
I recently started playing it again, and I forgot how brilliant it is, the best way to describe it is “baby’s first dark souls” it’s definitely in my top 5.
Graphics: B+ The visuals are fantastic, but the game may be a bit glitchy, only during cutscenes. However, that problem differs between people. Gameplay: A The controls are different, but well thought-out. A lengthy "tutorial" that really feels like the game will teach you everything you need to know. Different difficulty settings make it appropriate for everyone. Still, some puzzles may be difficult for younger children. Story: A+++ I'm sorry, but the comics made me a sucker for the Inquisitors. There's so much brilliance in the game's writing that I can't describe it all. It's incredibly immersive, and some parts literally made me shiver with joy. Not only is it fun, it's heartfelt, with messages of finding yourself and getting through sadness.
Listen up. Saying the violence is intense is stupid. It's Star Wars violence. There is no blood just little orange marks on Stormtrooper bodies. Not bad. If you can't handle the concept that human beings can die than you need to toughen up.
To start, this is not 14 and up. I think a 9 year old could play it. Violence: 6/10, There is a fair amount of violence but it is not bloody or graphic. It should be
