 but anything you can unlock is purely cosmetic so it's really fine. Matchmaking is great and I haven't run into any lag. Can definitely recommend to anyone 15+
Mortal kombat 11 is very gory when it comes to the fatalities but otherwise that's pretty much it. Unlike the previous games the female characters are not sexualized at all. They are covered up pretty well. So you don't have to worry about sexual content. But if you don't like violence or swearing this is not a game for your teen. Otherwise it's a very fun game, me and my son have had some great times on this game.
This game is super violent. Think of the worst possible death you can think of and I guarantee you this game will far surpass it. I mean most kids nowadays play Call of Duty and stuff and may be desensitized to violence. I think this just depends on your parenting preference and you kids sensitivity to extreme gore. I mean EXTREME GORE. The language is very infrequent and semi-mild. A few f-bombs (10 max) and sh*t as well god d***

Where to start with this game, this game is awesome! The graphics are lovely to look at to the point where they distract from the gameplay,the game is very hard but it tests the player to their limits. Some of the bosses are scary and the word "Hell" is said once or twice, but at the end of the day, Cuphead is a masterpiece.
Lets start with the graphics. It has been soooooo long since a game like this has come out and I was EXCITED! The hand-drawn visuals are on-point. You travel around the world collecting Contracts for the Devil whom you have lost a bet with. You play as either Cuphead or Mugman in this wonderful 1930's inspired platformer! Now, bare thy warning- Its very difficult. Those who rate this game one or two stars just cant simply do the game! I simply love the games little quirks! But as I said its very difficult! Maybe play the game WITH your young gamer or maybe see how they do because you don't want anyone yelling at the TV.Also if you are wondering there Is no cursing, and as a true carton should , it uses quirky words like, golly or Hot Dog! I just love my few snippets of the game!
This game is difficult. It is rage inducing, and hilarious, and sometimes makes me want to throw my controller across the room. But then you beat the boss you have been trying to defeat, and the overwhelming pride makes you want to shout. This game has amazing graphics (that we’re hand drawn, frame by frame mind you) that gives you the illusion of
