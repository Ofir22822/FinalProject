 already seen that it is possible in the game to set fires which is a major NO to me and why I strongly urge intense thinking before letting anyone play. It however also does reward slight positive honor for surrendering and accepting the consequences if the player should make a bad choice. I'm not happy that it, like a GTA game still releases you from jail whenever you commit any crime including murder. I would tell everyone to still avoid games like the GTA series in that there is no good or bad honor system and therefore it makes it seem like crime is the only way to win and therefore encourages it. And certain characters in the Rdr series actually have good morals and aren't just a bunch of sick jokes like GTA. again no younger individuals than 17 years old should play and they must understand the differences between a video game and real life. if they keep their habits clean and they are playing responsibly then they will find this game still has much to offer and is worth it. I might add that it has slight educational factors due to how it takes place in late 1800s early 1900 and players will want to know about history and how things were back in those days. the world is jaw-dropping huge and most all of it can be explored without violence. But only a top of the line gaming pc of 2019 or 2020 will have even a moderate chance of running this game at it's best. you really will want this game, but it will cost you on it's own and dearly for the nessesary system to run it. and also whatever happens DO NOT let your kids play Rdr ONLINE mode. GTA as well as Rdr online is where some of the most dark and evil behaviors and influences can be found and the in-game can become a bloodbath with players shouting words like "I hate you and I'll kill you!. Players can form gangs who follow their own path and encourage others to commit crime and this by it's very nature simulates gang activity in real life. Added to the fact that online gaming is not safe in many other ways. you simply will not go one second without some young nerdy punk cursing and swearing and joking around.
It’s an amazing game and if your kid can handle the language he should be fine if you know what he’s doing. You can make your own choices in this game so your not forced to do anything. Though the campaign only really has language
My son had anger issues so we took him to a therapist and she said she will help and she kinda did when we got back home me and his mom did work cause of corona and when it was lunch i found him watching a violent swearing movie and it caused his violence to go down so we got him this
