 this game. I played for a whole week and I thought 80% of the time was like this. It seems to be a fun hangout for bullies as well. They constantly put others down. Now if the language filter is on it may not be as bad but, then the conversations are just riddled with ******. I would say it's been overrun by immature bullies and may not be fun for some. If only there were moderators like other mmo games.
Among Us is a game where there is 1 imposter among 10 little spacemen and the innocent spacemen have to figure out who the killer is. Overall there is a little blood but take a red colouring pencil and draw a few circles on a page. That's the blood in this game. Use of guns and knives to kill people Lying Possible language in chat, but European servers are way less vulgar
The game itself is clever, simple and fun, but the chat exposes kids to all kinds of inappropriate language, name calling and sexual innuendo at times.
This game is extremely fun, but very inappropriate. The objective and the idea is very addictive and enjoyable, but the chat feature is NOT good for anyone younger than 15. I’ve seen so many children say their age and their school in the chat when my child was playing. I’ve seen players make VERY sexual references in the chat. This is NOT something that you want your child playing. Players have asked other players to sleep with them (obviously using vulgar language) and for all you know, that could be your child being asked that. Yes, you can have the chat censored, but people easily get around that. Instead of saying a swear, players will leave out a letter in the swear so that it doesn’t censor. All in all, this is a fun game, but it’s not safe or good.
My 12 yr old son heard all his friends talking about this app. It allows you to chat with others not in your contacts. There is an option to censor the chat which we turned on but the very first time I got on to use it someone was using explicit language. We immediately deleted it.
1. Children should not be open to chat from total strangers! I believe this can be restricted, but then it can also be unrestricted. Only takes one error of judgment from your child to allow communication from totally shady people and I know I wouldn’t want any child to face the risk. 2. The need to kill anyone or anything in a game is surely not something kids need to think is acceptable at any level.
it a good game you can play it with friends or with your family the only thing wrong is that people swear if you play with a random lobby and the toxic players on pc if you want to avoid playing with them play on your Android phone instead
It is extremely violent and there
