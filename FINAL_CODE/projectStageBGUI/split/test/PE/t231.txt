 if you're fine with strong language, blood, gore, and a bit of other M rated traits (ex: there's a seemingly friendly family in one part, but you find out that they are cannibals and they try to kill and devour you.) In the game, characters frequently say b***h, f**k, s**t, a**hole, a**, etc. The blood and gore in the game isn't that major. It's not very realistic. You'll often see blood splattered on the ground, and it is usually pink-ish. You will see mangled bodies, both of humans and animals. The blood is more realistic when it is on a body, but if there are splatters it's not realistic. The Outer Worlds is a great first M-rated game. At first, my dad sat down with me and watched me play it. After watching me play for 2 days, he approved of the game and let me play it unsupervised. As for guns, they're mostly sci-fi, and it is really nothing you should hide your kids from. In battles, there's blood splatter, but the game always has this fun, sarcastic, cartoony feeling. It can be a bit dark sometimes,(cannibalism, murder, etc.) Overall it is a great game. It is fun, entertaining, fascinating, beautiful, funny, sarcastic, and about everything in between. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
So far, I have loved this game on Xbox One X. Quests are really good and entertaining. In fact I loved it. So Much that for February next year I pre ordered it on Nintendo Switch! A couple of tiny problems. 1. I have to say violence is the main issue with this games brutal, gory, bloody so if your kid is really sensitive to violence then this is a no go. 2. Swearing is heard very frequently meaning very often the game drops f**k , sh*t, and b***ch. Over wise if your child can handle this kind of stuff in The Outer Worlds the this is a must have for any gamer.
U don't care what anyone says, this is the best game I have ever played. The graphics are stunning, and I don't know what common sense media is saying because there are good role models. You can literally just become the hero of the game, rescuing civilians from dangerous people/monsters. The blood might be a little more than expected, but if your kids are mature about it than it should be fine.
It’s wonderful but too much swearing
Pretty good game overall
Awesome game, 9+
Scary-ish Mystery

OMG stop giving this scary ratings
This game is great and fun to play with friends. It's not very scary, even though it's rated as "horror". The scariest part would be the neighbor, who you have to avoid in order to beat the game. You also have to find a set of keys. The game is very cartoony and not graphic. When the neighbor catches the kids, they fade away into a pile of missing posters, but as I said it's cartoony and not going to
