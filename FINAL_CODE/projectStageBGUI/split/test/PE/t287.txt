 there will be people swearing but there is a way to fix this just turn you're volume down when you're in a game when someone is using a mic. there is only one drug use part really and thats a cigar that a character called mcree smokes but it really dosen't matter that much.
team chat can get pretty vulgar and abusive. Be be aware of this before considerign joing team chat.
This is a great shooter for your kids who want something such as Call of Duty but you will not allow them. No Blood or Limbs coming off or anything like that but there is an unmoderated chat, especially for PC so what your kids will hear will not always be the best. Other than that, it is a Colorful shooter for young kids especially
The game is slightly violent but it's cartoonish and unrealistic, I'd say if your kid is mature enough and at least 9 years old buy it for them. However keep in mind it's and addicting game so they might get somewhat obsessed with it.
It's pretty fun to play the arcade modes and play quick play. Overall in this game, there isn't really much to cover apart from it being a really fun shooter with no blood, gore etc. There is online microphone use, which can be muted, but people can say swear words and other things on their mic; the most commonly known thing I've heard people say to others in their mic is that they are terrible at the game etc., but overall great shooter. It can be played anywhere from 9 and up if your kid is mature enough to mute people who try to talk bad about them.
Definitly let your kids play this exept for minor blood and cussing this game is more appropiate that other first person shooters play it all the it is awesome best game one earth.
great game IMO things to worry about though: there is very little blood when you get a good shot on other players but there is no gore, i recommend you child to be 14+ for voice chat as there is a lot of swearing, there is very little smoking but is fine, also do not be surprised if your kid is coming to you to ask you for loot boxes.
Overwatch is one of the best games I have ever played. I rate this game 10+ because of the lack of blood, profanity, etc (basically anything a parent would worry about). Though one character, Widowmaker, wears a revealing outfit, and McCree is always shown smoking, they don't effect the game in any way, except for some dialogue about McCree's smoking habits. There is a minuscule amount of profanity. The only "bad" thing any of them say is "damn" but it's always in another language, form what I have heard. There is voice chat in Overwatch. You can turn it off, however, it is essential to winning matches, for Overwatch is a team based game. Players
