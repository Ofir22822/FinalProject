 gonna buy the game. The game is #1 unique. Has good background and graphics, great gameplay, nice storyline, nice pvp mode and custom mode created by players and the game is challenging, and a good distraction if you have nothing to do and for your children to enjoy a videogame so they can leave you alone or if they have nothing to do or if they did a good job on something. Strong messages are wars and stuff like starwars but will never happen. The characters are sexualized but younger players will never notice, easy to play, too much violence and children might think that explosions, guns and other weapons that can kill you does not kill you in real life, too many fantasizing and otherwise called sexualizing, the online players swears, if you loved the game then you're gonna be one of those people who collects Overwatch items and stuff, the hero named "McCree" always smokes cigarette and the characters will sometimes speak like they've been drinking too much except the 19 year old "D.Va", Tracer, Winston and the omnics heroes, and people should read the rules and regulations before playing this to not get banned also some people will sneak into your Overwatch account also blizzard etc and will spam you invites unless you block them and then message you mean, mean things after a match is over and you still have to block them ingame and your ps4/blizzard account to prevent them from harassing you.
10+
great game
Warning about teams/competitive
Great Shooter for young kids!
If your kid is mature
Awesome Shooter With Little To No Violence.
Overwatch is awsome
Great shooter with some minor things to worry about
Likely the most kid friendly shooter game.
gets stale after a while
A GREAT WELL ROUNDED GAME
Toxic game needs to be more realistic like Roblox ... XD
My favorite first person shooter.
Good game
Overwatch... not that bad!
Honestly....
Frequent mild cartoony violence , ok for 11+
Incredibly fun, Relatively nonviolent and with a more lighthearted tone than many fps games
it should be rated 10+ because there is barely any blood.
Overwatch is a great game overall - but if you are a parent worried about too much violence or something, you don't have to worry! This game has almost no blood at all. (Except for a little bit comes out when you hit someone.) Mostly, it's all about saving the world and building up your reputation as heroes. If I was a parent, I would only worry about my child's safety. There is team voice communication but, for Xbox users you can disable it in the Overwatch menus or on the Xbox account itself. I'm not sure about PlayStation
this game has to be one of the best iv'e ever played with more than 20 characters and so many cool maps. there is blood in the game but its very dificult to notice while playing. there are some characters that do look a bit innapropriate but the only one that goes over the top is a character call widowmaker. there is online interactivity which means
