 but a very common one). 3. Trollers might expose your kids to UNWANTED content. As embarrassed as a I am disgusted, the trolls of the community have ruined this game for all ages under 18 years old. What do I mean by this? Some very hard working Losers who are living in their moms basement were able to modify the game files so there characters will be completely nude. You might say, ” Well isnt their nothing underneath a virtual characters clothes.” This part is where I become disgusted. They have made female characters like Loba have very graphic and extremely detailed ”ta-tas” and other women parts. Why do these losers waste their time turning this fun game into a creeps pornographic dream. I personally do not know but wish these players would get arrested as what they're doing is illegal. It's sad but they see very common to come across. 4. On the BRIGHT SIDE. I know this sounds like a very negative review, but I'll finish it off by pointing out some positives. First off, the violence in this game is overrated, when you “kill” someone, they don’t die they literally fall on their knees without a scratch and just disappear. This isn’t like Call of Duty where they get their limbs blown off or get blood everywhere. Also, this game doesn’t require a dime from your pocket. Although the option is always there to buy cosmetics for the game. This game is completely skill based their is no “pay to win” stuff. Thank you for reading my review. I hope this gave you a better understanding of the game. However, I really wish they would just remove Loba from the game and get rid of these online trolls and bullies. However, you will find this crowd in just about every other online game unfortunately.
It is my favorite game. When you hit head shots it sprays blood a bit but other than that the violence is minimal. A bunch of the characters are LGBTQ or just not your normal white male characters. It is a great game!
My son is 3 years old, and love this game. His favorite character is that cutie robot, pathfinder, who is inspiring my son to be an engineer when he grows up, so he too can build a robot to help him grow. This game also teaches teamwork, skillfulness, and give kids a whole new set of vocabulary words. It will inspire a new generation of soldiers and protectors of the planet, because we all know one day aliens will come for us all. La'Quchiuau Loves You!
I think all of your 14 year old kids should play this amazing game it's perfect for kids named riley
This game has almost nothing bad in it. There’s no language, all the violence is futuristic and minimal, plus there is no blood. the game is still very fun but it takes some skill of organization and I found the best place to play the game is in
