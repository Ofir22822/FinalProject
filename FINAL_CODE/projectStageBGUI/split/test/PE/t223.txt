 Wow
I LOVE THIS GAME, AND IT'S REALLY FUN!!!
Campaign is 16+, Multiplayer is Probably 13+
Take it from the people who play it. Not the "expert reviews".
This game is very disapointing
Fun Game, Lot of Language
Really good game but a bit much for some kids
Commonsensemedia doesn’t have any common sense
15+.
Amazing! Probably one of the best games in the franchise!

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) follows; Commander Shepard, Kyle Garrick, Alex, and Farah Karim as they fight a terrorist group in the fictional country of Urzikstan. The game seems to push the idea of ends justify the means, and that whatever soldiers have to do is permissible, all the while saying it is up to the player to make their own moral decisions. The campaign features torture, and constant violence, and language. The multiplayer is a completely different story, if you don't mind a little blood it should be fine, but the campaign is absolutely 16+
Yeah its violent but you can go into settings and turn that and the profanity off. These people are ignorant about everything and don't let your kids play games based off what they say. Just be careful about online players. And there is a lot of DLC's so make sure they by stuff with permission. Its a great game with great role models doing the right thing. Trust me I am a call of duty OG.
The game is fun but the problem with it is that the frames drop when playing. I would recommend this game 13+. The reason for this is because of the violence, swearing,Drugs/Drinking, and too much consumerism.
I love this game. The campaign and even multiplayer has quite a few F-bombs, but not an insane amount though. The blood isn’t really too bad, either, but the violence can be brutal at times none the less. I think it’s suitable for ages 14+
Ok it’s call of duty is a great game but may be to much for kids there is gore and swearing but like the other modern warfares it’s based on what happens in real life the murder of innocent people and children and the pain that people have to go through every day kids having to see there parents die in front of them and call of duty won’t hesitate to put that in the game so I think that mature teens should be aloud to play this game but ayy that’s your call

There is language, I hardly noticed it during the entire campaign, but I’ve heard worse on the bus ride home from school. Blood isn’t very noticeable, drugs are present in pretty much everything marketed to 13+, so your kid probably has already seen it. I only give this a 13+ instead of a 12+, because there is chlorine gas used in the campaign and it isn’t legal during wars.
