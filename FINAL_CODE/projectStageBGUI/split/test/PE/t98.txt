 my 11 almost 12 year old son dose not know, words used are words like shit and ass so nothing to bad. Great game kids would love it
This game isn’t anything special, but it is fun to play and has a good multiplayer. The violence in the game consists of anything you could do in an actual war, mainly being guns, knives, and explosives. There is blood but not really any gore, and the blood is minimal. There is explicit language in cutscenes, but it’s nothing a teen wouldn’t hear in the hallways. My main problem with the game is that it isn’t historically accurate. Guns are much more diverse and colorful than they actually were and the campaign, (except for “The Last Tiger,) is made up or incorrect in many aspects. The most historically accurate experience in this game is the conquest game mode.
This game is perfect for kids who can handle a bit of violence and blood, know that none of it is real ww2 footage and isn’t a sociopath. Perfect for lads named Tom L
it is only violent in the war stories so if you let your kid play i surgest not letting them play the campain
Fine for eleven or up, violence blood, language, but language is mainly in the cutscenes which you can skip
It's both educational and fun, and I think should be played by everyone age 9+!
Battlefield 5 is the fifth one in the legendary selling series. But I know you don't care about that, I know why you are here. Is this game violent? Unless you find pg-13 action movies too much for your child then no. Will this desensitize my kid and turn him into a younger version of Osama Bin Laden and or Hitler? Absolutely not, in fact i'm scared if you think that. Do I think this teaches you anything? No I don't, as a person who values historical accuracy and the preservation of history I do not. The story mode for this game is not accurate and ignores obvious facts at one point they attribute the liberation of a town in Norway to one person they don't mention the resistance fighters who fought for it and died they ignore them, to push their own agenda, not to mention the ninja sword and a woman with a prosthetic hook for a hand in the reveal trailer. Do i think that this game is too violent no, do i think this game is going to make you kid into a psycho like the media is trying to say, no i do not. But i am unhappy with the disrespect of history. So if you son/daughter wants this game by all means let them have it, but mention to them that the war stories are not true and are fake, They should find this game fun though, and you will too if you try it and get good at it. The bad language is really basic and your child is gonna be fine
