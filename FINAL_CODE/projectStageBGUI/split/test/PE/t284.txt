 are significantly more difficult to master for younger players. Younger children should be wary of the voice chat in competitive matches, where swearing and other toxicity lurk. However, there is always the option of turning it off. Great first shooter for new gamers!
This game is very fun and unique. As far as blood, there's very little and its very unnoticeable. Cursing is nothing more than c*ap or d*mn and its not overused. One of the things that makes this game so cool is the characters. They each have their own abilities that make them different from others, and it lets players find a character that's right for them. Most of these characters are great role models, and are against crime and fight for good. It might teach teach kids that sometimes, you have to risk your own life for someone else. For example: in one of the characters backstories (Tracer) an innocent person is about to get assassinated. Tracer notices the sniper on top of a building and jumps in front of the bullet. After a long battle to stop the assassin, a young girl nearby witnesses the battle and is inspired by the brave act that she took. This game is a great game and I feel like its a good one to start out with if your kid wants a shooter game.
Best kid friendly shooter i guess but it is a bit danger with the freechat and some people was ok it has in app purchases with the lootboxes for skins its a good game
easy to play with some characters, some are for more experienced players. there are guns but no blood and that is literally all there is to it
My mum thinks overwatch is violent, but i can say if my mom let me id give it 2 and up.
Overwatch is a great game and in my opinion has no aspects that a parent wants their child to avoid. The style of the game is cartoony and it includes no blood whatsoever except for when you are on very low health and a red outline appears on your screen. There are multiple characters to choose from and you start with them all at the beginning of the game. Each has exclusive abilities and appearances. The only reason I am rating it a 10 plus is because it is an online game and there are options to message and voice chat. Even grown ups will find this game amusing as you can either play it simply or look at it as a strategic, team based game. You can play a death match (all V all)
Played this game for 8 months and can tell you that the age rating is spot on the box or if a mature 10-11 year old could also play. Violence is very cartoon and no blood or gore. Sexual characters is only one but you can purchase a skin for 1000 credits to get rid of the cleverage so recommend doing that but a
