 on, I had to take out 100% of ghosts, but even now, it's 90%/10% at best) and you will have to do most of the directing and prompting to get your 4-6 year old to solve puzzles. You'll also want to consider taking over Luigi on boss fights if your little one is unconcerned for Luigi's well being. But the game starts out easy and gets progressively harder, so you have time to get acquainted with the controls if you are generally new to gaming. But it was great fun and I'm so glad I bought this game. So much so, that Peach has asked that we play through the whole game a second time. I give this a 5 star because it is the perfect fit for what I was looking for - a game that challenges my daughter to think about how to solve the puzzle at hand, introduce her to the next step in coordinating both thumbs to move and aim concurrently, and it's super fun, silly and cute. It's not going to be that challenging for the experienced gamer, but Dad is happy sincec Peach is always asking me to play it with her and spending time with her is why I Luigi's Mansion 3 in the first place.
To get an idea of how charmed I was during my delightful play through all you have to look at is one moment. There is a moment where a ghost nearly drowns Luigi and Luigi is saved by Polterpup. Luigi takes a moment to pet him and tell him how much of a good puppy he is.
A waste of money
Best Indonesia's fantasy game
Nice Game with good Giveaway
I say it’s 18 plus because it’s near impossible to play. Unless you are a wizard. The graphics are gorgeous it’s why I bought the game. But it’s controls are laggy, there are so many enemies and you take almost half a bar with every hit. On top of that you can’t heal. Not easily at least. I’ve played it for 2 hours and made it maybe 3 minutes in the game because it’s impossible not to die.
I learn about mythologies of Indonesia in this game.. Interesting story and suitable for all ages. You can learn many Indonesian mythologies that have never been known before..
I bought this game last week and got nice giveaway with special Soundtrack CD The art is beautifull and easy to play, the character is cute and lovely. The map is great and easy to understand. Nice game to collect. Love it !
The Lord's name is taken in vain.
Surprising bite.
One of the characters uses "For Christ's sake" in dialogue.
It may seem slow and miserable after its surprisingly fast paced intro which leads you to think this is some sort of hack and slash; but if you give it a chance and stick with it, you will find a game with strong atmosphere, innovative and intuitive role playing/progression mechanics and a story with (mostly) better writing than Life is
