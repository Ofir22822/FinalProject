 to this degree seems unecessary. The level of gore is equally unapologetic as well with tons of blood, body parts flying and grotesque sound effects to accomodate it .For the rest, whether or not you can enjoy the tasking and individual aspects like racing and upgrading will very much determine your enjoyment overall, but the DOOM style shooter scenarios are the highlight by far.
My child plays this all the time I think it's great my only problem is the dismemberment
This is a post-apoctolyptic first- person shooter open world video game. It is very fun and colorful, and takes hours to complete. Now for worying parents, lets get to the content of the game. This review that I am giving you is based of the IMBD parent guide for this game. Language- Occasional/infrequent/rare use of the f word semi-frequent use of gd, s***, and what the h*** Violence- this game has the same amount of violence as your average video game, but nothing that is to graphic for starting middle schoolers. You use a boomerang like weapon called the wingstick. Some blood spray, but nor over the top, and not really any gore. Sexual content-There is one scene in the game with people in their underwear, but it has do do with the culture of the characters shown in the scene, and isn't exactly depicted as sexual, and if you are worried about this, your child will have the ability to skip this scene. I think that the overall content in this game is fine for tweens and up. With the kind of frequent langauge not being strong, and there being a rare use of strong language, and the limited violence, and the skippable underwear scene, this game is a really good choice for parents to buy for their starting middle schoolers.
this game is violent but not as bad as the doom or call of duty games and all the sexual content is just one weird cutscene that you can skip of people in their underwear. theirs no sex or prostitution the gameplay is fun and exciting with tons of creative ways to create destruction. their are enemies that require timing and targeting to defeat bosses. to sum this all up rage 2 is a violent game that requires strategy to complete its open world and you can drive any vehicle and set up traps to defeat your enemies.
this game should not be Rated M
This game is amazing you can turn x ray kill cam off and the only swearing in the game is stuff like s**t I am a christian too and I think anybody who is 9 and up should play this. plus it's a good ww2 learning experience if you don't want your kids hearing stuff like s**t just mute the TV
Amazing
Best Cyberpunk Bartending Action game of the 10's!
It contains smoking and alcohol. Amazing plot lines. Sexual themes but no actual sex. Outside the bar, you can go home and buy furniture, play with your cat and read
