 the story moving and the characters beautifully thought out. Definitely recommend for mature gamers :)
I think the is game is a good and entwining game for kids and there parents. There is an open world to have fun and explore. The cursing in the game is the cursing you’d expect in a movie rated 12 the worst word is the f word and even that is said rarely the is also NO SEXUAL ACTIVITY
It is a great game with positive messages and not too much violence. I recommend this heavily to any kid age 11 and up.
This is an amazing adventure game! There is some swearing, but it is not frequent. Arthur might not be a good role model, but at least he is trying to repent. The online mode is very fun too, but people can swear in the chat. Great game for tweens!
Red Dead is a powerful story about the end of the old west and the beginning of a new era of industrialization, and civilization. The player character, Arthur Morgan, is a strong and three dimensional character, frequently doing terrible things to protect his family and friends. He has a strong moral compass but does the dirty work too. The game is centered around the life of an outlaw gang which lives by stealing from the rich and powerful. I'm 18 years old and I am squeamish to violence, but there have been two times I have been rather disturbed by events and things in the game. You can find an eviscerated corpse torn apart and strung below a bridge, left by a serial killer. In one mandatory mission a rival gang decapitates and horribly mutilates a friend of Arthur's. Otherwise the violence is not excessive for the subject matter. However I would not recommend this game to anyone who strongly dislikes gore and younger teens. The game is one of the best I've played because of it's strong story and emotional impact as well as it's fun and immersive gameplay.
My son started playing red dead a year ago and ever since my son wanted to know more about the old west he’s been playing red dead redemption. It’s a great game but it depends on the parent. There is a little swearing but my son hears that everyday so my review Is that it is the best game for ten year olds.
That game is really damn awesome and i recommend it a lot. Parents, don’t make your childrens missing out that beautiful masterpiece. A beautiful scenario, graphics, and so on. So far a very good game!
This is a fun open world game some say this should be rated 17+ because it has Nudity and Swearing and I'm pretty sure 11 year olds cuss and hear cuss words everyday so the swearing is not bad the Nudity is just them taking the skins of animals so they can eat
This amazing game has loads of content but might be to violent for kids but, if your kid has
