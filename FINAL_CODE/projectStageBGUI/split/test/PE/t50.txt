 playing in a 1930’s cartoon. And yes, this game does deal with the devil and have the protagonist (Cuphead) go to ‘hell’ to fight the devil, but it is not going to turn your child into a devil worshipper! The ‘hell’ looks just like the other islands in the game. It is trying to teach children that gambling is BAD, not to try it. On a different note, it seems like kids are given everything on a silver platter when they play games. If they die, they respawn with all their stuff. Auto saves and ample save points in levels take away the desire to survive. It makes the games less difficult and in my opinion, less enjoyable. Shooting is the main aspect of this game, but there’s no gore, blood or actual fighting. The entire game is set around a finger gun that will repeatedly fire bullets at the enemies and bosses, and you are only shown how far they are from ‘dying’ ( they are all shown ALIVE at the end of the game) depending on what stage they’re on. Cuphead is about learning patterns and dying a few times to understand how the level/ boss works. My 9 year old son has beaten this game so many times, and he loves it. I hope you’ll consider this for your child too.
I think Cuphead is a great game
I love this game even know its hard bht i think it is good for kids 9+ :)
Some of the animations can be creepy and too hard for kids under 12.
I don't know why someone said sixteen and up my six year old son played it and was just fine.the devil smokes a cigar but that's it.
its got finger guns on the devil its really good game
It hard
Cuphead is a great run and gun video game with 1930s cartoon in it but it's a good game for kids.
It’s for competitive gamers, it’s not an easy game to play and don’t play it if you rage easily. It’s art style is beautiful though.
Although it is good, It has people in the level "Clip Joint Calamity" smoking. And it is pretty scary at the Devil battle. But it is great for learning redemption. And It also has gambling, but beside that, it is a good game!
I've often lamented how kids these days, if you put them in a room with a classic like Contra, they'd throw a fit and break the controller or end up in tears. But it's never unfair. Kids are too coddled with hand-holding and autosaves every step of the way. That said, very young kids might be scared by the song lyrics about the Devil taking the protagonists' heads if they fail (and showing their skulls once or twice). Also, some smoking and drinking in the background.
The game is really tough and frustrating and you have to get used to the enemies' attacks on it. But it's a really fun and lovely game. I like how they use the
