 looks fantastic and is very fun, with some concerns throughout the game, but by Chapter 9 it's excessive and very problematic with no way to continue the game by avoiding it. Beware!
The game is full of positive messages. It will be hard for a kid that can’t read because there is much reading to do. The writing is funny and engaging. The game keeps you constantly engaged and it’s fun to see all the characters interact with you. It’s safe for kids! And fun for parents. Even if you don’t like Minecraft, this game will have you building in no time! It’s also a great introduction to rpg elements and the Dragon Quest Franchise.
Got it, love it!
Fun for all
Good but a fair amount of violence.
Got it for my family recently, we all love it! Very fun time playing with my kids, a great game for any tween!
I love this game for my kids it's very fun and we all love it
It's a fairly good game if your kids know about alcohol/tobacco and know the difference between video games and real life. There is some violence depending on how you play, and some mild pixelated blood but overall great game, shouldn't be much of a problem for mature tweens.
This game is very good just not for little kids
Shocked by this review. First of all it appears the reviewer does not understand the game at all. Second yes the game is very hard which is the point it is a sim game not an RTS. The game is taking sim city or banished and building on that with simple RTS mechanics using an AI enemy that never stops spawning. In essence you end up with a slower version of a zerg rush (starcraft) attempting to thwart the growth of your city which has ever increasing demands of food and energy... etc. Between each wave it is your goal to push your city walls out such that you have access to the needed resources to increase your tech tree and space to build the necessary housing and infrastructure such that you can keep up with the ever increasing waves of enemies. until your final wave which is a relentless hoard that is timed as long as you make it to the end of the timer you beat the board no mater how many layers of your city you have lost at this point. The reviewer appears to have missed this and assumes that the point of the game is to win or maybe as we used to say "beat it" but that is not the point there is no level progression in this game it is very much made in the fission of a genera of game that is not common but was rampant in the 1990's. Though not for everybody the game is excellent so long as it is played on a computer the console controls leave a lot to be desired. Also i would say anybody below the age of 12
