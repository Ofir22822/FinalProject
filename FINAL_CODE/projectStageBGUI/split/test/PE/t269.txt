 mic access, but the game is difficult without team communication. It is possible to find a team who does not use profanity. Children are often less good at the game, so I discourage younger ones to play competitive, but nothing stops them. Get this game for your child if you disapprove of violent or overly sexual games! You likely won't be disappointed.
Its a super fun shooting game with cool characters and skins for them! Some violence but no blood and gore. Great for kids over age 7.
this game is friendly and light. Fun to play. I love it so much. It teaches team work.
This is one of the best games I've ever played. Overwatch is one of the greatest games ever and also one of the most fun games. It is a superb multiplayer game. It has beautiful graphics, exciting combat, and a great lore. This game is centered around combat, but it's not graphic, a small flash of blood at the worst, but it is constant. Some characters of both genders wear revealing outfits. No actual in-game cursing, but there is unmoderated open chat. This game has some DLCs and merchandise including comics, books, online character shorts, and they're even making LEGO sets. This game should be fine for tweens.
The game is based on two teams of 6 battling over a common objective, however there are many special gamemodes to choose from that change the gameplay. The player chooses from a roster of 25+ characters, each with unique abilities. The variety makes the game difficult to master, but players are usually good with only 2 or 3 characters. The weapons of the characters can range from a hammer to a machine gun, and when a character is shot they can bleed red blood. The violence is not very realistic though, and I think kids 11+ can handle it. Many characters also are fighting for good and the game encourages teamwork. Fun with friends.
Overwatch is very fun and colorful, with very mild cursing and no sexual content. I think the only concern to consider when purchasing this game for your child is the fact that it is multiplayer. There is an in-game censor that obscures foul language, but that is only in the text chat. If your child connects to the voice chat, there is no filter and some of their teammates are likely to curse. Other than that, I highly recommend this game. It's been a great source of fun for me for years now!
There's nothing bad or inappropriate in this game. The violence is mild, there is no use of drugs, (except one character smokes a cigarette). However, the game has a voice/text chat that is required to use if playing Competitive Play. Competitive Play is, in my opinion, hard to understand to a 11 year old. So I think the game's rating is pretty spot on. Quick Play and Arcade gamemodes are much suitable for smaller kids. You can also come across some inappropriate custom games in
