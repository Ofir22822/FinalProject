 well. If you have done this and know it well and truly then that is not just it. If your child gets carried away and acts out characters in games and people in movies this game is not for them unless you teach them not to. This is simply because of the violence in the game and they would of cause act it out in real life and possibly do it on the friends and others in real life.
im scared for life
If your kid wants an accurate simulation of 1899 then buy them this game
this game is rated m because of a lot of things, the violence is why i rate it twelve and up. their is blood splash and lots of shooting. but if your child is a mature... for a 12 yr old than by all means, let them get this game.

I think its a great game i have watched some of it while my son was playing. there is a small bit of swearing but a kid or person 12 and up should now not to repeat it and has probably already heard it. its a great game about the wild west and cowboys. Overall a great game with 1 or 2 f words.
Children above nine should be able to play this game it is not very bad, there is little to no cussing and there is guns and it is nothing different to call of duty. It should be a teen rated game.(This is way more kid friendly than the first red dead redemption) I have beat the game and there is no NUDITY in the game at all.
Can I begin with saying this game is stunning. Truly incredible and if you haven’t experienced this game for yourself then I definitely recommend you do. Now, I have played through the entirety of the story mode in this game and explored the map. I have got over 200 hours on this game, and being a strict parent myself wouldn’t usually let my kids play M rated games. I do not let them play games like call of duty, gta etc. In this game, there is absolutely no nudity, some of the main issues I had was swearing and violence. The violence is bad, there is detailed blood and you can see blood splatter on the floor when your shoot someone. Throughout the story mode, there is Arthur (the main protagonist) whom commits multiple crimes at the beginning. Moving through the story, however, players get to see Arthur feel guilt from his bad actions, as well as this the game punishes players with a bounty if they commit crimes. In the world, you will occasionally see hangings taking place,
