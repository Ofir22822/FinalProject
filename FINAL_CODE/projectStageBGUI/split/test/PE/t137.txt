 I think it’s okay.
I think this game is fine but it is a bit violent Would recommend 11 and up is fine but it depend on your child
First off, this game isn't for youngsters. I know there are a lot of people on CSM claiming to be adults and giving it 10+ ratings, but that is false. First off, the major thing is that RDR2 is a violent, chaotic, western romp with plenty of mature content. Characters can be shot, stabbed, run over, choked, punched, kicked, blown up, drowned, and tortured. While it has guns, it doesn't feature modern-day guns like in other shooters, but things like Colts and other Wild West guns. Violence, blood, and gore is quite common in the game, with the ability to kill anyone given to you from day one. While killing is possible, you will get a bounty for doing so and your in-game rating, "Honor", will decrease. Even if you do kill, the bounty system reinforces punishments for crimes and makes you pay for killing. The characters also clearly feel remorse for their actions, as they commit pretty terrible things, but it is never revered and it makes it clear what you are doing is wrong. While sexual themes are there, sex isn't and risque images are pretty much the extent of it. Violence and drinking are omnipresent, with several instances of coarse language and drinking, but the drinking and smoking is present in every wild west movie, tv show, or book. Overall, it is a good game with morals, a clear knowledge of the impacts of your actions, and an immersive story. And while it does not really fit, you can pet dogs in the game!
Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the very few games that I would call a masterpiece. Everything about it - from the stunning graphics to the intriguing character development - is incredible. It's extremely immersive too - (SPOILER ALERT) when one of my favourite characters died, I genuinely felt upset and angry towards the people that killed him. This is down to the amazing work of the voice actors, writers and animators that make the world so stunningly realistic that you feel like you are actually a part of it. In addition, the gigantic open world and countless side quests means that even once you have finished the main story, there is still lots to do. The online mode isn't as good as the main game - there are a few glitches and it's less realistic - but it's still good fun. Red Dead Redemption 2 gets a perfect 10/10 from me.
So I’ve seen plenty of other reviews saying this game is appropriate for kids as young as 10, but they clearly haven’t seen the sexual, graphic and generally inappropriate scenes. Most of those things are stumbled upon by chance and you won’t see on every play through, though none are inherently ‘bad’, just not appropriate for younger players. Other than that the graphics are fantastic,
