 and dirty minded. as for the violence part, who cares. if ur son is a retard who talks about killing people with machine guns and stuff like that in public then dont allow him to play. other than that this game is BS! the plot is so stupid. idk why theyre showing the russians as pure evil when the americans werent any better. stupid plot about evil russians with weapons of mass destruction. it messes up the image of captain john price.
Modern Warfare is my favorite subseries in the Call of Duty Franchise. I like the more serious and (relatively) realistic approach to the gameplay. I was super excited when this was announced, and honestly. I am not disappointed with the result. In terms of presentation, the game is amazing. Gunplay is top-notch and feels excellent, the sound design is impactful, and the customization is vast. Graphics and animation are extremely detailed. The campaign is great, with a tighter story, grittier tone, and smaller scale action. But it's also why I think this game is recommended for 14+. The Multiplayer is standard content for a FPS (blood spurts, possibly toxic players, privacy concerns, etc), but the campaign has some very disturbing moments and explores mature themes not seen in most single-player shooters. There are a lot of things that bother me, maps aren't very good, weapons often don't load in at the gunsmith, the campaign is a bit too short, and it has microtransactions in a full-price game. Overall, this is one of the best shooters on current gen consoles (as of 2020).
I’m going to focus this review on the campaign because I know that lots of people are going to do a multiplayer review. It is a bit griddy and I definitely would NOT recommend it to any one who is not mature or old enough to Handel it but is a awesome story line and there are lots of great role models.players track down stollen gas and there are lots of good plot twists,and I grew up on the first cod games so that’s saying lot.And what commen sense said about shooting civilians is sometimes true.but it’s almost never on purpose.if you play FPS a lot you have to have fast Game reflexes and your brain thinks it’s just another ai or player. That’s going to end my review. Remember I would Not I repeat Not let anyone who is not mature enough to play this
Please don't let your kids play this game! This is too much violence. If they grow up playing this, it will affect their behavior! :(
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a reboot to the original Modern Warfare series. With new gameplay feel and look, this reboot aims towards a more cinematic feel. The story is pretty good and the characters are very much likeable. The narrative could've been a little better as well as the dialogue. Missions have more variety this time around. Some controversial and some genuinely refreshing for the series. Violence
