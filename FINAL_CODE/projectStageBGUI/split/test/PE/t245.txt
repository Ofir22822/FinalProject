Overwatch is possibly one of the best titles out right now. While it is an FPS game, it’s not overly violent. Few things to look out for. - one character, Mcree, smokes a cigar, - some female characters (Widowmaker and dva) have skintight outfits which may be to inappropriate for some children. Finally, please don’t let you child go on voice chat. Regardless of how well you think little Timmy can handle swearing, people on overwatch voice chat are very creative when comes to insults. People usually are in voice chat in competitive games, so maybe steer clear of those. Overall, it’s great game for the price, and with overwatch 2 right around the corner, it’s a great time to get used to the characters, and the feel of the game.
Ok look, the game has violence with cartoon-like guns. The worst in this game is a slight amount of blood when you shoot people, but I literally never notice it. There's some dudes smoking, but nothing illegal. This game screams family-family. If you let your kid play this game, they won't get angry and lash out, unlike what the media says, so it's fine. But it's really addictive, and there ARE ways to pay extra for loot boxes, but it isn't as prevalent as in games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Anyways, if you can find this game for $30 bucks like I did (and with extra content!), this is a buy. Even if it's still the normal price of $60, buy it. But just to know, if you play on Console (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo), you have to pay a monthly fee for this game, because it's online only. $10 a month for PlayStation and Xbox, $5 for Nintendo. Thanks for reading this review!
I dont think that this game should be 14 and up. This game is amazing for all ages. Obviously there is a lot of violence in games like this, but it is not too graphic. there is no sex at all. "oh no! A female character has a big butt! what shall we ever do?!" Thats what yall sound like! There are many female characters so sexism is pretty much non-existant in this game. Dont let a 3 year old play it! But don't try to shield it from a 12 year old!
This game is super fun and not addictive. The reason kids are acting bad is because the parents let them play to much. I play this game and have fun every time. The only down side is the voice chat, but can easily disabled in settings. Parents overreact
