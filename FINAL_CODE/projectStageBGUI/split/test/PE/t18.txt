 to get money for food; she gets on her knees, implying she would perform oral sex, however she refuses anyway before anything can actually take place. In refusing, the man gets annoyed and demands that she is going to "take it", otherwise threatening that he will "get real mad". Before anything else can happen, her linked supernatural being intervenes by strangling the man, and the main character escapes. There is some very mild nudity in a couple of shower scenes, although it is in no way sexualised nor explicit in its portrayal, mainly showing bare backs. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are sequences of strong violence throughout the gameplay and cutscenes. While much of the violence is more action-orientated (hand-to-hand combat scenes, action set pieces) and has less emphasis on the strength of the violence, there are some stronger moments where the violence is more disturbing and shocking, or has bigger emphasis on the infliction of pain and injury. An example of these stronger moments include a torture scene, where a character is cut with a knife on the arm, and it is heavily implied his eye is gouged out with a knife. While lacking in explicit detail or gory visuals, there is still some sight of blood and the whole scene is very intense. Another example is when your linked entity possesses a soldier to commit a mass shooting on a group of government officials in a foreign country: there is more emphasis on bloody impact detail than other moments of violence. Furthermore, another example is when a group of homeless people (one of whom is the main character) are threatened and attacked by a gang of thugs wielding baseball bats, and the leading member knocks out the main character. He also hits her again while she is incapacitated, and a pool of blood can be seen around her head. Other moments of strong violence include shootings and stabbings with limited bloody detail. There are also sequences of supernatural violence when beings from another realm torment the main character. PROFANITY - There is strong language ("f*ck"), and milder terms used throughout. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There is some drug misuse when players have the opportunity to smoke marijuana at a party, which causes the character to feel light headed. There is also sight of alcohol consumption, and one character is mildly depicted as an alcoholic. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent scenes of strong threat throughout, including some psychological threat and supernatural horror. There is also an element of sadistic threat in the interrogation scene. The entire game is very suspenseful, and also emotionally intense, and contains some mature themes. In addition, there are some points where the player can attempt suicide, such as the character finding a knife and beginning to cut her wrists (brief bloody detail) before being stopped, as well as attempting to jump off a bride into a busy road where she is again stopped before anything can occur. The theme of suicide is briefly touched upon in some scenes.
