 private rooms where you can play with people you know who have your invite code.
A great team building game. It has lots of logical thinking involved. Great to have chat filter so I know my kids are safe.
Among us is a teawork game were you have to figure out who the murderer is! I personally love the game. Most of the chatting is about who the murderer is. also you can ban or kick someone if they are being mean or inappropriate! Its not hard to play on mobile idk about pc though!
Ok if your scrolling down and seeing other ratings about which age you should be to play, You might see a few saying 7+13+ 15+ 17+ but this is the official answer. This game Among Us, has a LOT I mean a LOT of profanity. But there is also a censor chat option in the settings but that will just censor swearing. There are insults as “Go kill yourself” “go burn and rot in hell” etc. This game also includes Knives, murder, and guns. I recommend 18+ or older. This game is also very addictive your child MIGHT start acting up or their grades will drop. If your child is mature you can let him play it but make sure the censor chat is always on. It might look like a innocent cartoon looking game but in the inside of the game, (this game is online) Peoples ages are over 15 sometimes even in the 20’s in this game. Rarely young kids, Sometimes peoples username can be offensive such as “Your mom” Even sometimes their own Phone number in their names! The players in this game share their instagram usernames etc. Sometimes predators. Well if you finished reading this I hope this helps you decide if your child is able to play this game or not.
I thought this game was safe as it is a cute cartoon game so I played myself as I do before I let my kid play anything. Immediately I noticed a bully going as far as telling someone to kill themselves. There is no account system, therefore no way to report or track someone for abusive activity. Within a week someone had lured me into a lobby, switched to private so no one else could join and started lewd conversation. I jumped out of the lobby and not long after that it happened again. This time I was asked questions about about account names and personal information. The only sensor system takes "bad words" and replaces them with ****, which can be tricked by replacing a letter in that "bad word" and the system doesn't work on the player name, which you can change as often as you like. A user could potentially bring your child into a lobby, they change it to a private lobby by pressing one button so no one else can enter, then start making sexual conversation, bullying your child with abusive texting or trick your child into giving
