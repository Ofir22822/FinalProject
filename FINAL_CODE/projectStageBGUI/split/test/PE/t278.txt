 be, and how much your teammates rely on you. For a single-player game like minecraft (which does have a multiplayer option, but let's stick with single-player for now) I really don't think it matters how good at the game you are, as long as you're having fun! In Overwatch however, each team consists of six players, which means if one of the people on your team can't really contribute, the other five have a huge disadvantage. That being said, I know there's plenty of 10-12 year olds who are great at fps games, so don't take my age rating too strictly. Like I said, the graphics are cartoony, and there's no blood, so as long as your kid can aim and shoot, it should be fine.
I play this game at my friends house and i like it a lot. it is not that violent and if you are allowing your kids to play games like star wars battlefront etc. , than in my opinion, its o.k. for tweens to play.
This game is fairly violent but good for kids 8 and older. All you do is choose a character and try to take a point and defend or move it to the checkpoint. When doing this, you will try to kill the other team's players.
Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch may be their very best game yet. Its Pixaresque animation style and unique cast of characters are just several of the many wonderful things it has to offer. However, there's some blood and violence, some mild swearing, and one of the characters has a cigar in his mouth at all times. But overall, Overwatch is a treat for tween and teen gamers.
I do think that it is appropriate, just not worth your time. I got the game because everyone said it was good, and it sucked. I think that you could get better FPS games in Star Wars Battlefront or Halo.
The game itself is amazing and one of my favorites. It is extremely fun, and requires strategy and teamwork, unlike other shooters. Sadly, what keeps me from giving this game 5 stars is the community. Too often, players are harassed or made fun of for not playing a hero well. Often this happens in the voice chat, which players can hear even if they're not using it themselves. Its also extremely easy to be exposed to profanity and other language parents may not want their children to hear. If your child can't handle toxic players it is possible to disable voice chat and text chat, though this affects teamwork in a negative way. Overall the game play itself is quite good and if your children can understand cyber bullying, I would fully recommend it. (There is one hero who uses "dammit" infrequently and a huge e-sport tie-in with skins and other in game purchases)
Overwatch is a game taking place in a semi futuristic world following the "Omnic Crisis" in which robot producing factories went rouge and begin to produce massacring monstrosities of robots by
