the game has an interesting story about a biker and im not gonna spoil anything im just saying common sense media should of rated it 9 and up because its not that bad its basically the last of us which is also an amazing zombie game for 9 year olds for 2019 if they want days gone get them the game if there 9 or up but if your kid knows about drugs and they can hear cursing and there under 9 get them it
Ok first off I must say the Christian dad with the two sons Your kids have a wool pulled over your eyes buddy. I’m not that Christian you would say but I can’t stand the lords name took in vain and if you was a true Christian I’m sure you would have heard the GD every five seconds. Yes you all heard me this game takes the lords name every line it seems like there a GD here and GD there it’s so ridiculous!!! Other cussing I could stand but I can’t and won’t listen to this every second a lords name took in vein !! The game physics are awesome totally something like far cry and a zombie game it’s pretty sweet but gosh the gd gets me every time. Can’t stand it and NO you can’t change the language to no cussing. I only wish ! You can change it to like French and stuff but come on The game itself is rated M 17+ just cause there friends parents are idiots and let there kids play games like this shouldn’t mean you should. Btw I have three kids
This game is pretty slow and has violent content and TONS of cursing. If your kid is mature enough not to say extreme curse words, they should be fine. Just a fair warning, there will be a lot influenced by this.
I have four kids at. They are all twelve and love days gone. The game is a lot of fun since i have played it myself when I first saw the rating I said no But after playing it I realised it was a fun game. There is a lot of blood but not a lot of cursing good for twelve year olds.
Days Gone has amazing game play and an alright story. It is however very graphic and I honestly don't understand these parents who say there's barely any blood lmao. Just as long as your kid is mature enough to handle all the gore.
In my opinion this is a boring game despite the long wait for this game.
Days Gone could have been
