This game is vilant an should defanitally not be played if your kid is under 10. The multiplayer i would say players 10+ should be able to play especially if they are mature and understand that real war is real and not a game. The multiplayer is a little gory, but you can turn the blood settings off and the cussing. The campain is definitally worse with more gore,fighting, and cussing so i would say 13+.
The M rating on this game MEANS M 17+ Campaign(War is Brutal) 20+ This Portion of the game is why i have it set to 18+ if i could i would say 20+. This game gets dark extremely fast as it beings with a cut scene featuring a group of terrorists claiming responsibility for a terror attack that happened before the events of the game and ends with a Suicide Bomber walking out of van with a detonator in his hand before cutting to black. There are also scenes of torture via waterboarding, Terrorists Executing Civilians, Limbs being shot off with a sniper rifle etc. but, it does have role models in the realistic way that they portray the SAS and US Military and how they operate Multiplayer and Spec Ops(Mindless and Difficult Fun) 14+ Spec Ops is pretty much the same from the past years and Multiplayer is vastly different with new mechanics and a new leveling system overall, just use your basic instincts when deciding if you want your child to play Modern Warfare(2019)
The COD formula has deviated from what we have come to know and love from MW1, 2, etc. However, its still a really cool game to play.
WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS This year's Call of Duty isn't just a run n' gun mow everyone down game. It's a real military game this time involving tactics and quick thinking. One particular mission in the campaign "Clean House" has you deciding who is just a civilian and who's a terrorist. This mission is one of the most controversial of the campaign. It involves a woman running somewhere you don't know until she gets there (she might be running to a weapon) so you have to decide if you are gonna shoot her or not. If you don't shoot her you see that she was just running over to her baby and there is nothing to worry about. Another scene is when a car is driving in your direction and you don't know if it is civilian or not so you have to wait. (It ends up being civilian). Anyway the multiplayer is by far the best (way better than fortnite) and it's cross-platform so you can even play with friends on pc xbox and ps4! If you buy the Dark Edition of the game for $120 it comes with a set of real night vision goggles the actually work! This game is great for young teens that can handle it.
