 Fantasy combat with a fantastical gun where blood looks like smoke. "Body explosions" dont cause any gore; its almost literally fairy dust. The worst you'll see is periodical very bloody bodies. Infrequent strong language. ** This game just sticks and grows on you the more you play and think about it. One might notice the exploitable and seemingly shallow combat that is not painfully challenging. But look longer and you will discover superb level design, wonderfully contructed mayhem and the sense of superpowered fun that is unparalleled in its genre. One may be disappointed with the plot and its unclear conclusion and one-note protagonist; but the more time you take to analyze the game world, its subtext and intricate and purposeful decoration; soak in the haunting and uncanny atmosphere complemented by a surprisingly quirky sense of humor; search and read for every lovingly placed and written collectible and multimedia you will find a rich world that isn't dependant on traditional story conventions. Also NO FORCED WALKING or walls of boring text (Eat it Quantum Break!). Remedy's best if you ask me.
Severe difficulty spikes may discourage casual players.
As you progress through the beginning of the first world the balance and challenge seem fair and rewards skill. However, very soon you are dropped into tight corridors and can be quickly overrun with hordes of enemies. The "dodge roll" is your only real evasive maneuver that you literally HAVE TO master for each enemy. There is a slowness and weight to your character that you cannot simply outrun enemies for long and you will be required to "Get Good" at this one go-to move. The game rubber bands difficulty (to a degree) so that new players can play with higher levels, but you will still be very squishy and weak in comparison much of the time. So, if you are big into the Dark Souls level of difficult and lumbering gameplay, you will feel right at home with this title. But more casual player should NOT mistake this for another shooter like Gears or Division as you will most likely die several times over before defeating many of the areas and especially multiple times on the majority of the boss fights. Also, if you are totally new to this difficulty "genre" of other such titles, you may be frustrated and tempted to quit very early on. I played with higher level friends for the first week, but after a fresh attempt on solo. I quickly realized how much I was dependant on better players, but as a solo player or with Randies (random players) this game can be brutally difficult. Not sure if I would have bought it and invested the time had I known some of this sooner. NOW, the good is that most of the bosses are interesting and there are a couple dozen different enemies as this game does not skimp on enemy types which keeps it fresh. The weapons are well done and feel good with fair hits and
