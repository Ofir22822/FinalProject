 not have enough patience, and are likely to be frustrated. That said, the simple beginning - a single star system and a few ships - makes this the easiest of the Paradox strategy games to get into. If your child is already familiar with other strategy games, particularly Civilization, they will probably be able to enjoy this one as well. If you are considering buying this game for yourself, you could probably involve younger children in designing your alien society. The game doesn't offer a particularly good or bad message. Your society could be a bastion of peace and democracy, or a bloodthirsty empire bent on galactic genocide. You could be devoted to your faith, or a ruthless criminal syndicate... or, in some cases, both. It should be noted that the game has a multiplayer component, with up to 32 possible players in a single game, and all the concerns that online multiplayer brings into any game.
Has great mechanics and a great premise, but has many of the same problems as Civ V where it just feels like something's missing, especially in the midgame, and its adoption of policy trees like Civ V is I'd say one of the greatest mistakes in its design. As well, whereas the civilization games have gone down a path of really ignoring atrocities, this game lets you do some messed up stuff to your populace (or fight those who do), which does help a little in flavor, but in the end, it's a lot of throwing balls of ships at each other while playing Star Trek brueaucracy sim.
