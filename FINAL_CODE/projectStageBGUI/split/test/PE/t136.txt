It Is Not That bad

Awesome game
A good game, not for young kids but fine for 10 and up
Excellent game for a mature audience
Masterpiece of a game, truly incredible.
I think red dead redemption is a lot of fun.there is some gore,drinking,swearing,and sex but if your kid is over 13 they probably know all that.this game is definitely not as bad as gta when it comes to sex scenes there really only one in the bar in the mission a quiet time. Gore is not terrible but it’s very realistic you can shoot peoples limbs of but them on train tracks and stuff but it’s not bad.there’s another scene where a guy comes in on a horse holding his head but you can skip the cutscene.I think red dead is a great game and would recommend it if your 13 or older
So I would recommend it for 10 and up parents normally know rockstar for adding nudity and most of their games being rated M into a game but Rdr2 does have a little but not too much and it is only in the missions it is not as insane as Gta I think it would be ok for kids to play this and Im saying 10 and up for the guns and violence and they dont say millions of bad words and most of them are just shit and bastard still it is a good game and they dont curse too much so it is an amazing game just dont let your kids play the mission
This game does contain occasional swearing and limited nudity while players may do bad things he also helps people that are being hurt,sexually asullted,and victims to racism. Honestly my 14 year old son loves the game because it’s a fun and creative entertaining game. I say if your kid is around the age of 13-15 he will be fine as long as he is matured.
Hello, I think that 11+ is a good age to play RDR2, it does have a lot of swears, but n word is only used once it the story, there is good role models (kinda) the good role models would be Arthur, Lenny, Sadie, Charles, John, and Hosea. There are moments around camp where you can hear Ms. Grimshaw call some of the women whores, and Micah is blatantly racist, Micah picks on everyone except Dutch, There is also a mission where you can stumble across two people having sex, but that’s only if you go into that room, in that same mission you have to get drunk. Also Bill is an alcoholic, other than some of the language
