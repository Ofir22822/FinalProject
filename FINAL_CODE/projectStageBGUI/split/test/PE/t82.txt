 With updated graphics, this game has extremely dark and disturbing imagery. NOT FOR KIDS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.
The Resident Evil 2 remake is surprisingly good in my opinion. Most remakes don't compare to the original. But this took the game and brought it beyond compare. The new tactics with the introductions of old characters. (Mr. X for example.) Really pulls this game together.
This is a suitable game for teens and is very enjoyable for high schoolers
It’s a little violent but it give realistic to the game
