 Not too violent.
Perfect for 9 year olds
Fun online FPS
Suprisingly good morals for a game with no story.

Overwatch has no gore and has only fantasy violence. As long as the person who is playing it knows what fantasy violence is it should be fine. Overwatch is a great game if you are looking for a first person shooter that has no gore and only has fantasy violence.
Little swearing, but it is Damn and little blood, only if you get super close to Roadhog and shoot
I honestly was not expecting much from this game. I thought it was just going to be another violent online shooter game. As I played this game I realized that the graphics are different from other FPS (First Person Shooter)games or games in general. It is actually really cartoonish and fun. I love how you can choose between a ton of different characters. I also like how you can change to a different characters throughout the game. My personal favorite character is McCree because he is a cowboy. I am a little sad that the creators of this game didn't give it a camping. Although I do like how there are different skilled people playing against you. I really like how the graphics are not realistic and more like a cartoon. I think they will make a second Overwatch because of how successful this first Overwatch was. The reason I think this game is OK for teens thirteen and up is because there is violence (the violence dose not focus on the blood or realistic stuff) and McCree smokes a cigar. Overall I recommend Overwatch to any Halo of Titanfall fan.
Overwatch is an interesting case. The game is multiplayer only, with no story contained in the game itself, other than some lines between the characters themselves, Overwatch seems to be a game designed with the experience being the only priority in mind, but through other forms of media, the game has established a consistent story and universe, which conveys many positive messages about social issues in the real world, which can positively influence teenage, and younger audiences. The story surrounding the game revolves around Racism and discrimination against a race of self aware robots which are clearly supposed to symbolize minorities. The story also touches base on other issues, The main character in the series was revealed to be homosexual last year, and many characters' stories revolve around moving on from loss, and above all, using tragedy as incentive to be a hero, and never let anyone else suffer that way.
the reason i rate overwatch 14+ is because some kids may not get how competitive this game really is, plus open voice chat, reaper says "damn" quite often (mainly when losing the payload) soldier 76
