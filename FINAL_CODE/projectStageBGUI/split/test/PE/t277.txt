 game. Furthermore, the game is extremely pointless and sad. There is absolutely no sense of progress whatsoever. So iv'e warned you. The game is cartoony and not violent and all, but mentally, you will be dead inside after your first couple of hours. On a side note, off-competetive is pretty fun with friends, but will definitely get boring after an hour or so. I hope you trust my comment. I have a lot of experience on the game.
No swearing, no sex, a tiny bit of blood, but the game goes so fast you don’t notice it. Great for older kids.
This game is very good with graphics and content. The game communication is a bit on the questionable side because of toxicity but all in all it is a really good game. and also I just want more 8 year old squeakers on the mic because that is always histarical.
Very Good SI-FI violence
Overwatch is an overall good game. Have your child be carefull around three characters, Widowmaker, D.va, and Mercy. Those are the most inappropriate characters in the game. One character, Mccree, is always seen smoking a cigarette. The online interactions are the worst problem. You can turn them off by pressing p in the main menu. It can be hard to play, depending on which character you play as. The majority of the characters are good role models. The plot is is pretty much a group of people come together to defeat the evil robots. The game can be very frustrating at times. There are some splatters of blood sometimes. There are some voice lines that use d*mn. In all, you will be fine as long as you are carefull.
Overwatch is a fun, easy to play first person shooter that allows you to use different heroes to take the opposing team down. Each hero his his or her own abilities and weapons. Some things you should know are: 1. Overwatch DOES have an in-game chat that allows players to communicate with one another. This allows them to come up with strategies, plans, and ideas to win the game. However, there are are many players who use the voice-channel to curse, rant, and attack others. Your child WILL be exposed to harsh language and toxic strangers during the game. 2. Although Overwatch is a shooter, there is minimal blood and the cartoony look makes it perfect for younger children. 3. Overwatch features both genders, though some of the woman are wearing tight, skimpy outfits. In conclusion, if you think your child can handle the toxic voice chat and some skimpy character, this game is perfect for them.
I want to start off this review by explaining why I put ages 13 and up. This is not because of violence! While this game does consist of two teams fighting to the death, the cartoony graphics and lack of blood made me originally rate this game ages 10 and up. However, the reason I put 13+ is due to how challenging this game can
