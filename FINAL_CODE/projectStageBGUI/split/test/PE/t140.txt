 covers her boobs. and you can find a man who lived with wolfs that shows a penis, the n word is only said once and other words are what you here all the time. if your going for a peaceful playthrough what's the point of playing the game because how are you going to get through the story or anything. in Rhoads at night time you can find a kkk meeting . I don't want to spoil the story because its good and I highly recommend this game to any over 13 because its a master piece.
I'm gonna be straight up here this games is quite violent, there is so much choice in how to kill people but it's just choice . The stories violence at worst gets to Buring people alive (messed up ik) but only bad people are killed like that and it's not extremely graphic. Secondly. Adult themes, this game is not short of racism, sexism and more, but it is not supported. Your kid might not even pick up the racism or masogony. You will hear the N word about 3 times at most, but it is only said by one character (Lenny) and you can find the KKK but they are shown as being stupid so yeah. Thirdly. Nudity and sex, there is zero nudity but sex is talked about on acasion, but it's no more than on the office. You can find prostitutes but cannot hire or do anything with them, and you can get bathed by a woman but it is not sexual. Lastly. Language, swearing is very common but no more than a 12 year old says around his friends, and it isn't really used offensively. F**K is used a fair bit but mostly in anger or by one Irish character (Sean) and Sh*t is used very often but lots of the time in anger or to literally describe horse poop. So in reality just see how your kid stands on racism, woman's rights and what they want to do in the game. If your kid just wants a good story and a fun open world it should be fine.
The language didn't need to be so bad. This game rocks otherwise. Someone said the "f" word and "s" word were the worst, but c---s----- is frequently used too.
This game is pure amazing and a work of art, but it is very violent, has sex acts, drug use, drinking/getting drunk, and lots of swearing. It is still a very good game and I highly recommend it.
I used to work at PEGI and they are extremely strict there for example when this game first came out I voted it to be 12+ Same as Mortal Kombat 11 and also many other games I have voted in (COD MWF I voted 12 same as BO4. For COD WW2 u voted 16 as it was the world war. But anyway this game is only ok if your child is sensible and you have brought them up
