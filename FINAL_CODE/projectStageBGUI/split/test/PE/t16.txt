 some interesting powerful weapons. You can also gain armor sets, each with unique and stackable perks and mods for your weapons (AKA Turret or minion summons, healing rifts and hive swarms). Much of the aquiring of these may have you looking up you tube videos as several of the puzzles for attaining the best gear are not obvious. It's a well done game with some memorable boss fights, but it can truly kick your butt throughout, and seemingly designed to do so..
Just another BR disguised as something else
perfect game
The best game
Was hoping to find something fresh and different from the overdone mayhem that is the battle royale genre. But alas, it's just one more in disguise. They lure you in with the promise of PvE and the occasional (even hinting at optional) PvP but my oh my, how well deceived you will be - I certainly was. The scenery is quite good looking. The map is pretty much the same, with dynamically changing objectives. And the mobs have interesting mechanics to keep you constantly moving and aware. But that's it. The lack of depth in the quests is disappointing. You can craft weapons, only to have to buy them ingame, with credits... And the match making is laughable. if you're looking for a somewhat entertaining FPS with quests in between, this might be for you. Otherwise, your time is better spent gaming on something else.
it has good graphics its smooth .There are many things you can do .
I know that it says it is 13 and up but it is not really
Sophisticated and great-looking turn-based strategy game
If you're looking for a simple game, or an action game, this one is not for you. This is one of the most sophisticated turn-based strategy games. It has a strategic level map and then a drop into tactical battle map. The graphics are great. There is much to learn. Mastering this game exercises your cognitive skills! I believe no one could say this game was 'mindless entertainment' that was a waste of time. If you believe games can be great learning and skill development exercises, this one is for you.
Just another generic walking+jump scare (TM) game
You walk around a drab house for 2 hours with mediocre/easy "puzzles", predictable jump scares, and occassionally run and hide from scripted monster attacks all while a dull story with poor voice acting plays out. No inappropriate content save for a (child's?) severed head covered with maggots in one scene.
GOOD GAME
Worth the buy if you have extra cash
The best game in America
i think 9 plus is outrageous for this game you play football my son plays this all the time the only bad part is multi player because some people curse it is a good game and family friendly.
Good game but could use mild improvements in gameplay style.
It is so much fun it does not have bad stuff in it
This was boring as hell
Pretty shovelware. Playing a Mech-dog doesnt come close to fully armed boots on ground action.
