 mass destruction, and murders to name a few. In missions you can kill civillians, they encourage you not to but sometimes you can. Some cutscenes are interactive and you can chose to torture a man. This is no where near the extent of this form of violence due to spoilers, but just so you know, very few of any cutscenes include gore. Language: In cutscenes and dialogue includes frequent use of f—k, s—t, p—-y and more. Unmonitored voice and type chat can teach you’re kids some words or phrases you might not want you’re 9 year old saying around the house. Consumption: Alcohol and smoking are used sometimes throughout. Profile pictures include shown references to drugs. Sex: Very infrequent minor sexual talk. As referenced above some profile photos include some imagery related to nudity, but nothing other than somewhat exposed buttocks are shown. Extra: User generated and some game made profile pictures include imagery including animated photos of cannabis and drugs, sexual imagery and exposed buttocks. Role models and messages are very vague to to the story.
This game is violent but you can enjoy it if you mature enough to handle it, Tje campaign includes swears like F*ck in diffrent sentences Sh*t and Hell

As you enter, you watch as soldiers that are being burned alive crawl towards you. You can either shoot them or watch as they are slowly, painfully expire. Another choice is in the fifth mission of the game, Clean House, where you enter a room and find a woman. She rushes over to the back of the room, terrified. She is rushing towards a baby in a crib, which starts to cry. She comforts it if you spare her, but if you shoot her, you're guaranteed to be full of guilt. If you shoot the woman, the baby awakens and begins to cry, as one of your fellow soldiers tries to comfort it, and
