 FUN
Love this game :)
Truly the ULTIMATE game
its a game where you attack people but it should not get this 12 + rating it should have a 9+
Given the genre it is exactly what you'd expect, punching, kicking, throwing fire balls etc. but all very tame. A really good beat'em'up with a tonne of content.
This game is revolved around fighting which already is a minus, In this game u can master the game pretty easily but its not too good for new gamers, but overall besides the violence and the consumerism its not that bad!
Because smash has special skills but there is no blood and gore added to the game. There is no bad language but some characters wear skylight suits which shows some sex refrences but there is no alcohol and drug abuse in this game.
I play this game soo much that it is embarrassing. Great game if you want to have a family game night. Well, family game night for kids 9+... I suggest to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch. Retails at $59.99 — What’s in the game? Violence - Violence is the point of the game, as you brawl against every character for domination. You'll use fists, feet, weapons, objects, special skills to defeat enemies by launching them off the screen. Cartoonish nature and lack of blood and gore lighten impact of gameplay. Privacy Concerns - Can play with people all around the world. Sexy Costumes - Some female characters wear skintight costumes.
Better than your dumb reviews
Packed with content that will keep me playing for years to come. Every Switch owner should buy this game

good open world game
common sense states there is mindless violence. the truth is that the main protagonist (the person you play as) is actually trying to liberate a region held by a mercenary group known for violence and brutality. there is little to no blood. the only blood you see is when you hit the ground or little spurts come out when you shoot the enemies. this is not grand theft auto 5 violence that can be seen with civilians. in this game theres no blood when you shoot them they simply fall to the ground and after awhile disappear. what I have the most fun doing is creating big explosions with the many gadgets you have to play around with not to mention the great scenery and vistas. This game really should be rated T for teen
I have watched my son play it with his friends and there in very low profanity and no graphic violence. My son is 10
