 darker part of the game but it also came out with some positives. one being that it shows great role models in the commanding officers also it shows how no gender or race prejudices as one of the highest-ranked officers and one of the few people that play a continuous roll throughout the game. the only concern that I had at the end was the slight mist of blood but that can easily be switched off in the settings before letting your child play. now the multiplayer aspect of the game to me has the one negative in the light mist of blood. other than that the multiplayer part of the game is a sandbox where your child can play with their friends try out a new thing and complete the everpresent challenges that keep you on your toes. another thing that makes the game a lot easier on your child is the skill-based matchmaking. Now, this is only active when your child is playing online. What it does is puts your child into the game with similarly skilled players I found this great as when my son was playing he wasn't outmatched but able to have an enjoyable time. the other parts of the game such as the multi

There is also a house storming mission in which gives the player the option to shoot unarmed people however this is meant to be avoided. None of this is glorified however and it really does show a realistic sense of modern warfare. The multiplayer is just your average call of duty game in terms of violence however and if your kid just wants this side of the game, i think it would be fine for anyone over 12. Overall the game is very violent and can be disturbing in places however it is a brilliant game that mature teens would be fine with.
This is a great game as i play it myself. The violence is probably the main cocern for people so i will cover that first. There is obviosly going to be violence because it is call of duty. The thing is, the fighting is always fast paced so most of the time you wont know whats going on. When you shoot an enemy there is a small bit of blood that
