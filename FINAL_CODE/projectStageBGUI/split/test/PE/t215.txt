 dialogue leaving only subtitles, Mute online players, and turn off the gore. I say for teens mainly due to its heavy theme of the campaign but most things can be filtered.
My favorite video game series. I think its not that bad for little kids to play
I would’ve given this game a 5 star review if it weren’t for the fact it has and extremely short campaign as I finished it after about 5 hours. This game main problems are the violence and swearing. The swearing is pretty frequent. Like all call of duty games The violence is pretty bloody and frequent.
Being a big fan of story based games I have to say it was pretty good. Violence: almost all of the violence in the game is shooting. Personally I can handle this even with the blood and gore. You can turn off blood in settings but keep in mind it can be turned back on anytime. There is also melee combat but it isn’t very exaggerated or violent with only a simple animation and a tiny bit of blood. Swears: there is frequent swearing throughout the campaign but I don’t recall any in online multiplayer. These include mostly f-bombs and some s##ts. It’s nothing worse than what I hear at school. Campaign: the campaign/story was the selling point for me, I did play some multiplayer but found the story much more intriguing. It was insanely well done for a shooter and there were some good messages of teamwork and doing the right thing. In conclusion, anyone 13 or older should be able to play this game without any problems and I would rate multiplayer a 4/5 and the campaign a solid 5/5.
The review that Common sense media gives it is based of the story made which is much darker so my review is split 18+ for the campaign and 13+ for the pvp aspect
