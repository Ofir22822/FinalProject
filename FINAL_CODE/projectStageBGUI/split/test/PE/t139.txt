 played games like minecraft they wouldn't blink at this because it is the same concept. Unless your kid is immature, they can probably play it
Excellent game, however extremely graphic, realistic bloody violence throughout. Has dismembering as well as graphic nudity. Very foul language as well. Very well written story mode and online is getting better as the days pass. If your child is mature enough to handle I'd let them play it. I'd only let a little one play to ride around on a horse for a bit and nothing more as you can go on full killing sprees on innocent people.
Rockstar Games hit a grand slam with Red Dead Redemption II. This game is Rockstar best game yet plus Rockstar eased off on the sex and drugs sine GTA V. I will say there are some references the prostitution and Jim Crow but the violence is fine for any sort of mature kid and the protagonists are great role models.

My Thoughts
Amazing game!
Red dead redemption 2 is a fabulous game. The rating of this game is r16 but really is fine for anyone kid around the age of 12. Firstly red dead 2 is an amazing story and it's not all about violence and isn't gory by any means. This game has minimal swearing, a bit of violence mainly because of the hunting and no way should be rated r16. I let my son who just turned 13, who has been begging me to play this game. I looked at some gameplay of read dead 2 and I realized this 60+ hour game is for sure fine for most 12 year old kids to play. Even rockstar, the producers them self said this game was more eligible for kids then there other games. Coming from a Mom my self I would say to all the other Moms who's sons are looking to get this game it is really not as bad as people say and should be fine for your 12+ kids to play.
its an amazing game. the violence is fine its just like any other shooter. the only gore I found was in a few side quest and a few main quest. you can also blow the limbs of people but that's only with a shot gun or you shot them several times with any other gun. and you can set people on fire. the only sexual themes I remember is when Arthur is gets super drunk and tries to find Lenny and walks into a room there is a naked woman on top of a man but she
