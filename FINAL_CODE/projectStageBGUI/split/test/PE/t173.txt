 a very enjoyable game, and one you should give a chance, as the media can sometimes over-exaggerate on these titles.
I bought this game for my 13 year old thinking its going to be a bad choice but i was looking at the settings and you can turn off blood and gore and its just a shooter like uncharted and its a great to socialize because theres teamwork involved and its great for the situation we are in right now.
its graphics are amazing and its pretty realistic
Consists of some possibly disturbing scenes, but nothing my kids have not heard of seen before
Hello Parents. You have probably come to this website because your youth will not stop bugging to let them play this game. Whether it be that all their classmates have it or not, I would like to shed a little light on this game. It's obvious that Call of Duty games might be a little more on the violent side, but as a fellow parent, I can assure you that it's nothing too bad. Yes, there is blood. Yes, there is gore. But one day your kid is going to witness it all in the world wide civil war. Trust me. It will happen. All jokes aside, people often tend to pull Call of Duty in the category of games such as GTA or some other game. There is no need for this over exaggeration. Surely you don't want a kid that passes at the sight of blood. This will tough em up. :) La'Quchiaua Loves You! &lt;3
This is a good game for anyone above the age of9 with the content filters on. These content filters get rid of all bad language and gore bar the cut scenes that you should tell your child to skip. LOTS OF LOVE KAREN SMITH. The media is wrong about this game and I trusted them. In short do not trust the media about any video games. Or video game consoles. Video games enrich your child's life experience especially this one. KAREN SMITH APPROVES
The next Call of Duty Game
Violent
Finally a CoD game worth buying
Should be rated based on maturity
Should be fine for most 14 year olds and even some mature 13 year olds.

Rated 15+ for strong bloody violence and language.
My child is 13 and for her birthday only wished for this game. Having heard of how bad call of duty can be I was very hesitant but I looked at the gameplay online and did a bit of research. The story mode can be a bit scary but in the settings, you can turn off blood and gore as well as profanity. the multiplayer had no disturbing
