 is pretty intense. Cutscenes or key story moments as well as gameplay can contain some horrifically violent moments. Not gonna go too deep on it, but one scene shows a suicide bomber taking out blowing up a section of London. Others contain shooting civilians that are suspicious and can't be trusted. Language is strong and frequent. Use of "arse" "f#!k", "f#!king", "$h!t" and "b#!ch" are heard in dialogue.
This game truly isn't too bad. You can disable gore and swearing, and only play the multiplayer. The campaign is where the violence really happens but most kids want this game to play with their friends in multiplayer. Please take this into consideration!
If you have a child who can handle some gore, and violence, then maybe let them play it. You can always turn off gore if your on PC, and the campaign doesn't need to be played for anything. It also has a mature content warning for good reason.
Tbh i think it is just fine for 12 year olds and up because you can turn of violence and gore etc..
Im not the biggest fan cod but the campagin really good
Okay, so first off. This is a perfectly fine game, with a little excessive swearing and such. The violence is fairly low, the worst being people strapped in bomb vests (civilian). The game helps children understand war, and the role models are great. In most of the game, you are a member of task force 141 trying to save civilians from "Al-Qatala" , a terrorist militia. You'll see many heroic actions preformed which provides great role models. Okay, now for the worst part. The consumerism is high, with a single operator and a few guns you'll most likely never use bumping up to 20 dollars. The battle pass is fairly cheap, and I recommend it. Although if you want an Allegiance (Russian) skin, you'll have to pay up quite a bit. Surprise purchases are very easy without a parent's permission warning or anything. Anyways, that's my opinion. Just make sure your kid understands war, and won't swear.
Modern Warfare very accurately depicts what war is really like and I feel like children should know what the real world is like.
This game is fine for most ages. multiplayer 6+ but the campaign is at least 11+ check the options you can turn off dismemberment and game chat. It is an amazing game definitely worth the price!
I think that I may be gory but I do not think that it should be rated 18+ because there isn’t that much gore
Ok so I think most of the game is pretty disturbing like the mission where your a child and you see your dead mother in a cut scene or where your tortured it’s really disturbing to me anyway it was great story just I felt uncomfortable during most of it just because of how loud and I guess disturbing it all was you have to hide under a bed from soldiers and stab them that was super
