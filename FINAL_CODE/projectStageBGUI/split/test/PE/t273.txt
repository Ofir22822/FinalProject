 is a really fun game, it’s a lot better than those graphic gun gamer and a good substitute! There is a character with a rather tight clothes, and a cowboy smoking, but I think a nine year old would understand the right thing to do and stuff. One bad thing might be is the online interactions, if you don’t want your kid interacting with people online, you can always disable it! Other than that it’s a great game! Sorry for any bad grammar/spelling I recently moved from Yemen so I’m still trying my best to get better at English!
Overwatch is my most played game on my Xbox one! I don't know how other kids feel about seeing or thinking about blood, now if you are, this isn't your game. If you get shot, smashed, or slammed too much, you'll die or animated blood will show on the border of your screen. Also beware of reaper, for his main line is, "DIE DIE DIE"! But otherwise good game!
I absolutely adore this game! This is one of my favorite video games of all time. For what reason? I haven't a clue! There's something about it that's so enjoyable that I keep coming back for more. However, there are a few concerns I have about this video game that could be helpful for you in deciding whether your child should play or not. First off, there is a LOT of toxic people in this game. I think it's gone down quite a lot, but it's crazy how rude so many players are. It ranges from snarky remarks to incredibly sexist comments. What I recommend to avoid torment is by staying out of voice chat and keeping personal information out of chat (Like your age, gender, etc). I also never enter the voice chat channel, so I won't hear what others are saying. Despite what Common Sense Media says, there IS swearing present in this video game. Of course players will sometimes use strong language, however, there is a profanity filter to keep it from showing up in chat. But most of the Overwatch characters actually swear. When a player receives an item called "Orb of Discord", they will yell, "Damn!" One of the characters, Genji, on top of saying, "Damn!" will also say, "Kuso!" which is Japanese for "shit." Soldier: 76 &amp; McCree (Most likely more I don't know about) also say "damn" in an unlock-able voice line. Those, I believe, are the only things that really concern me that Common Sense Media didn't mention. But this is a really enjoyable game and I recommend it!
I got this game for my birthday and was very excited to play it. As soon as I started playing it, I loved it! I play on Xbox one and it is probably the best game I've ever played, crossing with Fortnite. It is not gruesome and when somebody dies, they simply fall to the ground. I would recommend age 11 and over because it is a violent
