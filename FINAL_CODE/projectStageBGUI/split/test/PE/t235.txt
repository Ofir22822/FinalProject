 player, it’s really hard to get better because the only ways to play are with other online players or shooting targets. So you have the option of too difficult or insanely boring. Fourth, the new characters. Why??? They are all really badly designed, far too powerful to be fair, or terrible. There are some good bits though. Some of the new maps are awesome, the graphics are strange but exciting, and the new skins look cool.
I love this game so much! Although it is not a good as garden warfare 2 it is still a very fun game and I recommend giving it to your child if they are a fan of pvz.
It is a great game that is very easy. I see no reason for youths 8 and higher could not play
I love this game being a player of the garden warfare games and pvz heroes. This game has an official rating of E10+ cause fantasy violence. and I understand that there is so much you can do in game whether its helping out a football playing zombie to escort a washing machine with puberty-esque insecurities or helping a sheriff pea plant keep zombies in jail, this game is a fun time. This game is always fun to play with my friends and siblings and is just a goofy game to have fun with. I mean come on, a super hero zombie punching a cybernetic orange that shoots literal orange juice to kill zombies, how can you say this is bad for kids. This game is great for anybody. I have a friend, who's parents would never let him play a shooter like Halo or COD (Call of Duty), but this is the kind of shooter he could play with me, and it teaches people team skills being a game where it is 100% team based with no free-for-all modes at all. I guess you could say its good for your brainz, get it? Plus, I have some personal recommendations for your kids based on age: if your kid is ages 6-7 allow use the free roam regions on easy mode, for ages 8-9 allow them to use the lobby to play against their friends and bots and the free roam on any difficulty to avoid teammates who are not very nice in online multiplayer, and for ages 10+ give them free control over what they do in game.
As someone who's played practically every Plants vs Zombies game, I'm happy to say that Plants vs Zombies: Battle For Neighborville is a fun and fresh game. If you've played the previous Garden Warfare games, then you know the basic idea of this one. It's a third person shooter that has the player fight the opposing team as a plant or zombie. You choose characters and play. The newest installment has some new mechanics such as sprinting, artwork, and characters. However, the single player "campaign mode" is disappointing as I still want a fully fledged out story instead of basic missions.
