 even before you turn on the setting. Also the cursing is muted. Also this will be available on may 15 2020. Thank you rockstars.
First of all, RDR2 is a great game, with an immensely interesting and immersive story, but, very graphic. Some reasons why I recommend RDR2 for kids 15 and up, would be because of lots of gore, language, and mature themes. For example, people can be shot, stabbed, lassoed, mutilated, dismembered, Etc. Characters will have frequent conversations with mature themes, such as sex and alchohol. Also, People at the saloons will drink, and it will often cause them to blackout, your character can drink, and others too. There is lots of swearing, with people constantly using the F-word, and B-word. Finally, consumerism is present in this title, you can buy gold bars with real money, and money in-game. These are a few reasons why I think RDR2 is for kids 15 and up.
I am so glad that Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting a content restriction setting in this beautiful game. Red Dead has become free in the Xbox games pass. And Xbox has a special rule that kids should be able to play all the game on there game pass for maximum profit. Once you load into Red Dead Redemption 2 you pick if you want to play online or story mode, Story mode is a bit more mature but with this update both are child friendly now. Thank you Red Dead for putting this in your amazing game so younger gamers can play this award winning game.So if your kid was begging for this game then you don’t need to be pestered anymore.
I am glad there will be a children’s mode released on may 15
I agree with Common Sense Media’s rating suggesting that adults only play this game. So far, I have played for a few hours and made it out of the snow to the campsite. I find it surprising that the “parents” on CSM are suggesting younger ages than the kids are. What I have seen and heard so far is not excessive as some mature rated titles are (such as the new Doom games), but it is still appropriate for the mature rating it has received. Violence and gore: So far, I have seen several shootouts, a fist fight, a dead horse on the ground with its guts sprawled into the snow and urine underneath it, and a decapitated body strung up underneath some train tracks with blood dripping from the body, and guts on the ground. To the side of the lower half of the body is also a head of the character that is pinned against the wooden post with some form of stake and a paper inserted into its mouth. A lot of the violence is what can be seen in some Teen rated games, such as the Uncharted series, but there are occasional scenes that are more graphic, such as the slow motion deaths that show realistic detail of
