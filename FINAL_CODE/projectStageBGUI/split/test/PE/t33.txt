 the levels interesting, at times you feel the simplicity and limits set for the game and almost hope they turn out a sequel that fleshes out the concept more. I recommend this game, at least as a break from the seriousness and grinding of other shooters, especially the online FPS games with endless, repetative chore lists for gear. This game fills a good arcade niche of just wanting to hop on, kill some baddies with stylish simplicity, maybe have a chuckle and go about your day. Good enough for me!
Good Castlevania Clone; perhaps less sexualization in the next title
Has lots of Castlevania easter eggs, and is challenging. If you are a fan, you can pinpoint which easter egg came from which game. Has a bit of an identity crisis until about 70% through the game where you finally get some unique qualities. One thing to add is that it's not just the first boss that shows breasts, but there is a vampire boss that is sexualized, as well as some of the lesser enemies and even a nun wearing skin tight clothing, each character I have mentioned has big breasts. The main character herself is sexualized a little, showing her big breasts just enough to show a crystalized tattoo, which the story justifies as too painful to cover and happens to be on her heart... The main character also stands in a way that shows her figure (the game justifies this as a sword stance) There are better examples of characters that aren't sexualized within the game, but contrasted with bosses and jiggle physics (big breasts being overrepresented), they could do better on the character designs. Otherwise, the game is quite fun and challenging.
Pretty Innocent
The game is cartoony and and is, overall, pretty innocent. The 15+ rating that C.S.M. gave the game is insane. They should rename the company to ComedySenseMedia. Honestly, are overprotective Cristian moms writing these reviews?!
Depends on level
It’s fine
Vr
ABSOLUTE MATURE 17+
i almost peed!
Fun and scary for everyone over 13
It's even more terrifying in VR.
Horrid thing
Don’t listen to any one else!
parents your probably think from the images that this is scary but it is not its fine theres no blood or gore the jumpscares can be frighning but it is kinda funny i let my 8 year old son play this and he loves it i looks scary but more fun then scary.
Fun
Amazing
I SCREAMED!
its a little scary for 8 year olds
It can change depending on the level such as animatronic repair being 7 and over in my opinion and dread bear being mature 12 or 16 but great game dissent matter what you like everybody enjoys it because you scream and 5 seconds later your all laughing but the back story is very dark so if your young try not to read the back story but once your older the backstory very good and interesting
Its fine it is a horror genre Other parents has said “TO SCARY17+” but if you get it then you know what your getting
