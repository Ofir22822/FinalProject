 Turn off the gore in settings, and you'll be fine.
I believe most of the REALLY bad or disturbing stuff happens in the campaign which attempts to showcase the horrors of modern wars. The violence in the multiplayer modes and warzone is not as bad and those modes are where the 13 and up comes from. The only bad parts in these modes are some rare swearing, a little red mist like blood that dissapears a second later, and limp bodies after players die. So, i say get the warzone only mode(it's free) if your kid wants to play but isn't old enough for the campaign.
Amazing game for young teens with no sex but be warned that there is drugs and alcohol with strong language so if you played Batman Arkham Knight you should not have any problems with this game
This game is good if your kids understand what is happening. There is multiple scenes of peril and when civilians are shot, but take away that and you have a fun military shooter.
So I would say that a kid 5+ could play COD but only Multiplayer but Campaign or CO-OP then that 8-9-10+ so it’s a good game but in Multiplayer you can learn a bit. Example: When your sniping at someone but they are sniping at you at the same time then there scope flashes even if your not sniping. But they’re is blood and if your playing Warzone there is something called Plunder and I think they changed the name but you kill people and can get money or open crates and get money and give it to a helicopter but Battle Royale is Fortnite but will allot more to it like guns,blood,and more.
Before you read this review, consider this: what are you buying the game for? The campaign, or the multiplayer? The campaign is for sure what bags this game the age rating it has, as scenes of genocide and terrorism are present in it's 5-6 hour run time. It's pretty heavy. But if you believe that's fine for your kid, then go for it, you know them better than anyone (assumedly). If what you're getting it for is the multiplayer, then the age is much less relevant. The multiplayer is low on violence besides shooty shooty bang bang boom, and the minimal blood and gore effects present can be turned off. The multiplayer is where the game's value really comes in, so if the campaign's content bothers you, don't write off the game just yet. Look into the multiplayer yourself to finalise your opinion.
I don't want to be the kid that rates the game higher than my own age so I am putting 13+. Game has gore, but that could be turned off. Mainly fear themes are the problem but I you have a kid who understands that it happens in the world, then you should be fine. Language is nothing a kid 12+ hasn't been exposed to.
One thing I have to say first is that I
