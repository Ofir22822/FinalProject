 being a symbol of Hell??? Then does that mean if I use a charcoal grill with flames to make BBQ that I'm somehow not Christian or a devil worshiper? And what about smores which normal people make over a camp fire? Also you don't "kill" the Pokemon (not "Pokeman" as the idiot called it) you throw a ball to catch them. You never kill the Pokemon even when you are actually battling them. When Pokemon are defeated they are not killed like the one reviewer alleged, they faint/pass out from exhaustion. The guy who made the Pokemon series actually said that he made it to where they don't die so that kids won't associate death with losing. Plus if she was actually watching her child playing, she would see that the game has positive messages about friendship. And if she thinks that this is violent then she shouldn't let her kids play games or watch TV period. Mario has ghosts and fire pits and levels that resemble Hell and yet she picks Pokemon to bash for doing what movies, TV shows and games have done for years. Don't listen to the overprotective person because you should use your own judgement. I find Mario to be more violent than this and most people don't raise an eyebrow at the violence in that. As for concerns about animal cruelty not all the Pokemon are based off of animals. Magnemite is a magnet, Exeggutor is a coconut tree, Tangela is made up of tangled vines, and Mr. Mime is a clown and Jynx is a human-like creature that could be considered racist. Jynx would be the only concern I have since she used to be black faced but got changed to purple because they didn't want it to be too racist looking. The only other thing I can think of to be worried about is that the game is too expensive and the ball accessory bundle is almost twice the price of the game by itself. The ball gives you a free Mew but it's not really worth it.
