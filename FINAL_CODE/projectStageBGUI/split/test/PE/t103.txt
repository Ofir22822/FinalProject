 bad at all the only thing is that someone dies, but gets reincarnated.
There isn't that much horror in this game. It's mostly jump scares, mixed in with the occasional pentagram or deformed character/ink blob. For the lowest age rating, I would say probably a really mature 9-year-old or a mature 10-year-old. Other than that, an 11-year-old would handle this just fine.
my dad thinks this is a really good game i do too. i like all the jumpscares chapter 1 is hard and 4 is hard. There is some violence. Spoilers: Some characters known as the butcher gang are a little too scary. i like t'hat you can take weapons like an axe to defend yourself. Its sad sometimes. Final judgment: four thumbs up!
This game is honestly really fun. It has a very interesting and investing story line that pulls you in and can keep you entertained- wanting to learn more about the story every second you spend playing it. It's creepy and overall, enjoyable! The game doesn't have much to be concerned about. It has extremely cartoony violence. It does have a bit of what I call 'ink gore', though; where it has 'gore', but it's not blood- it's just ink. It's not much to be concerned about, however, as it holds no realism. The game's animation represents that of a 3D, interactive child's cartoon.
Rythm and fun!
This game is easy to learn and fun to play for all age groups. Most young children (5+) should be able to play on easy settings - though it will take time. Older kids should pick it up easily straight away. Besides being fun this game teaches coordination, timing, and rhythm. If it is mirrored to a TV it is also good fun for the whole family as every family member can watch one another play the game.
Fun arcade game for teens and up
It's an arcade style game. Very little story. The goal varies between winning a race, getting to an objective in time, and taking out opponents. Between each "level" you can purchase upgrades and refills. While I haven't seen any drug or alcohol use or heard any dialog about it yet, some of the upgrades are drugs that give you boosts. Between that, the violence, and the frequent swearing, it's not a great game for the little ones, but could definitely be ok for older kids who can handle that sort of thing. The 4 player split screen even on PC makes it something you can play with your older kids that you'll probably all get into.
I'm Very Happy With It

What’s all the fuss about
#momlife it is horrible for your kids do not ever let them play
I have this game and I'm in LOVE with it. It's totally appropriate for kids, it's teaches a good lesson, it's great.
Let's face it, The Sims 4 is totally inappropriate for kids. From getting drunk to getting pregnant. My kids used to love The Sims 4 and played all the
