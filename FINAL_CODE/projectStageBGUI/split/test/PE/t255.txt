Well I think 7 YEARS AND OLDER CAN PLAY TH?S GAME because its so simple and good.
I’ve been watching my son play this game for the past few months. Usually he plays with friends and seems to enjoy the game; as parent I decided to see what the game was about. I was curious on what the game actually was; so I asked my son, about the game. I soon realized that the game was horror game. As a parent I soon got distressed on the fact my son was playing a horror game. I soon did a bit of research (and by actually playing the game) learned about the “horror” this game supposedly had. The game revolves around 6 kids. These kids have to find 6 keys (depending on how many) around the map too unlock a hidden door. The “horror” of the game is the neighbor who tries to capture all the kids before finding all the keys. When you’re caught the neighbor picks up the kid (in a very cartoonish way) evaporating the kid into nothing. The only scary thing is when the you finally in counter the neighbor. Nothing a kid couldn’t handle. The actual game is very cartoony and is a blast to play. Most kids around the age of 9 can easily handle this game.
Looking on the other reviews of this game, it has come to my attention that some believe this game is "too scary, and full of horror." The truth is, a kid can handle it. No kids would ever get nightmares or have bad thoughts by the intention of this game. All this game is about is kids working together trying to solve puzzles while someone is trying to capture them. No blood, no gore, no language, and being captured by the villainous neighbor isn't brutal in any way. Online chat can be used but can easily be turned off.
this game is really fun, but a little confusing on xbox one because there is a cursor on the screen. otherwise a fun spin off game for fans. although, the game is scarier then hello neighbor, and hello neighbor hide and seek. But hello guest is extremely scary( which hello guest is theroyized to be hello neighbor 2). and this game can have players talking into the microphone so you can hear them. although you can mute them, it takes time so a bad word or two might be heard. and the controls are really different from the first two hello neighbor games, otherwise not nearly as glitchy as the first two games either, which is great. also, one last thing to
