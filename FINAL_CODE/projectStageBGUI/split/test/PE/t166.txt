 Blood can be turned off. Small blood splashes with regular hits and large ones with parrys and backstabs. No gore save for a hydra boss' heads. Some enemies can be butthole stabbed. Pretty humorous but can be wince inducing. Some enemies desintegrate into dust rather than blood. Macabre imagery of the dead, decayed, burned, spiked. Obscured spider boobs and harpie butts.
