 moderate depictions of violence, including impalements and potentially upsetting character deaths. | Language: Almost entirely mild: damn, hell, *ss, crap, b*stard. Rare usage of moderate language, sh*t. All dialogue is through text, none is spoken | Sex: No sex scenes or nudity, a handful of characters have slightly revealing outfits. A town early on in the game contains a brothel, though this is heavily implied and many viewers may completely miss it. Occasional mild sexual innuendos. | Drugs: Some bars throughout the game, though alcohol is never seen or consumed
There's a fair amount of questionable stuff that's not mentioned here (even after it was toned down from the original Japanese). And I hope every kid knows that using those built in cheats (at least without doing at least one honest playthrough beforehand) is a matter of deep shame. At any rate, despite it's reputation, VII is far from the greatest Final Fantasy, but it's an industry and artistic milestone in many respects.
Great Game
Anyone mature over 14
Good Game, Know your kid
Won game of the year 2019!
Fromsoftware, you've done it again
This game is great! Violence is a large focus of the game so some amount of maturity is required but kids 13 and older should be fine maybe even younger for especially mature kids. If you are worried about the blood do not worry! you can completely turn it off in the options before the game even starts!
My son asked me for this game a while ago, and I wasn't sure about it because of the rating, and the fact that we have pretty high standards when it comes to ratings in media. However, the only thing to watch out for in this game is the violence and blood/gore, but the gore can be turned off in the settings, and there is no language or sexual themes. Really, if your kid is over 14 and is somewhat mature, they should be able to play it, it's not really going to be anything they won't see in PG-13 movies or TV shows
My son asked for this game for his 11th birthday, I was hesitant because the game was rated M. I read reviews and watched gameplay, and thought it was ok for my kid. There was blood present during the game, but it was minimal. I think the game is suitable for anyone who is remotely mature.
As much as this games a bit violent, it's not anymore violent from the standard movies your child probably watched anyway.
Sekiro is beautiful, somber, frustrating, thrilling, and the hardest game I've ever played by a long shot. Seriously, if anything is going to make you return this game (or, more likely, take it out of the console and snap it in half) it's going to be the difficulty. Now, I am not exactly masterful at video games, but I've surmounted every challenge fromsoft has sent my way so far, so I feel at least somewhat qualified to warn you about the difficulty. The game is unbelievably fast
