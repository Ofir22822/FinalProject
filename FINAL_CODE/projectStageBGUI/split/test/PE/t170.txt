 Horrible game.
Same as other call of duty games.
Call of duty Modern Warfare.. why its not that bad
Needs a powerful machine but is still a great experience.
Not as bad as you think

THE MEDIA IS WRONG
I it is a fun game and not bad and everyone should play it
I am a professional PEGI reviewer and rate games on common sense media.org. I noticed that commonsense media consists of many fake parent reviews and I want to start a movement for change. Please check my reviews on popular games, for trustworthy and informative reviews. This game is just like any other call of duty game. Same game every year. There is frequent profanity throughout including f**k, s**t, hell, damn, b*tch, and bastard. language is 8/10. Violence is constant, gore can be turned off. All shots result in some blood and RARELY dismemberment. Blood can barely be seen from far.(sometimes it can't) This game as always will get a 13+.
I personally have taken time with my 11 y/o and my 14 y/o to play this game. We have one day a week that we play against each other, and have endless amounts of fun! Now about the gameplay and the violence... when you eliminate someone, its not like blood comes GUSHING OUT. There is a tiny bit of blood that drips onto the ground. The game has little swearing, and if swearing is a big deal to you and your family, I suggest turning the volume off so that you don't hear it at all. As far as roll models go, it has many. You are mainly a British Armed Forces soldier fighting off terrorist attacks in the campaign mode. I don't see the harm in that. It is teaching people what is right and wrong, and teaching kids about our world. An educational aspect of the game is, it teaches you a lot about guns. I myself just from playing with my children, have learned numerous guns, the country and military that uses them, and many many things about forgein militaries. There is no sexual content what so ever. I hope as a fellow parent, this helps you out.
M rated I don't think so. There is legit no gore and the blood is barely noticeable. Also, there is a setting called the turn of blood and gore which I told my kids to put, and they where like ok it doesn't matter there is no disadvantage. Yes, this is a shooter but shooters aren't unhealthy. Finally, the price I know this is a full-priced game costing 80 dollars Canadian and the game never goes on
