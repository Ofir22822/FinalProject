New PVZ installment with good content
This is the third entry in the Plants vs. Zombies shooter titles. I'm not going to say this is Garden Warfare 3, as the graphics are different, some of the controls are different, and it just has a very "different" feel to it. On to the appropriate for kids part. Age ratings are evil, by the way. First of all, there are absolutely no role models in this game at all. That isn't a bad thing, either. It's just that the characters don't do anything except blast each other. The weapons in the game are not in any sense realistic, and says the same for the violence, which just shows how much damage you do, then characters disappear when deceased. This game is not addictive, but can cause great anger In players, as it takes a long time to kill people, and the sprinting feature allows people to annoyingly run away from you, allowing other people to steal your kill. The game also has an entire community of players who won't let anyone catch a break, including ability spammers, ballers, players who will jump off cliffs to stop you from getting them killed, suicide chompers, night cap mains, husk hoppers, and oak spammers. This game has a ridiculous amount of flaws, but there are so many elements and features to the game, the pros dominate the cons. One problem is you can't play the competitive side of the game unless you have PS Plus or Xbox Live Gold. If you don't have these, you will be restricted to the PvE side of things, and you shouldn't be rushing out to buy the game. Also note that you must have PS Network or Xbox Live, plus you need to have or create an EA account, and have a stable internet connection to even start the game. Plus, you can't get the game on Switch. I know. That concludes this review. I hope you found this helpful. Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville is out now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One.
A fun shooter that has fun modes for everyone. The free roam lobby may get confusing though. Also theres in game currency but it does make the player fell satisfied.
I got it a while ago, and whilst the game isn’t terrible, it is much worse than its predecessors. First up, the skins now don’t give you different weapons, which was a feature of GW2 I really enjoyed, although I guess the skins being just cosmetics does take away the pay to win element. Second, it’s really REALLY laggy. Third, it’s only online. There are no upsides today this. As a new
