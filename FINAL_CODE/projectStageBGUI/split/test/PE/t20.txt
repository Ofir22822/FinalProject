 interests, but the sex itself is always cut out. There is also a scene where Jodie gets molested by three older men in her teens, but Aiden, the entity that is bound to her, kills them before they can do anything too graphic. Harsh language is also very frequent, especially from the main character, and can't be turned off. There is blood where it is necessary, and it also can't be turned off. The game (or whatever it's called) has a positive message at the end saying that loved ones will always be with you, even after they have passed. That being said, the game is also very depressing since nothing ever seems to go Jodie's way, and she can be seen frequently crying. This may not be a good idea if your teen is going through depression, because it might make them feel worse.
beyond two souls is an average game based on the similar game that David cage made heavy rain stars with two familiar actors Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe but parents due to the mature themes beyond two souls is not for kids this game is only for adults and parents you need to know that beyond two souls has some intense violence many in which Players can punch and kick human enemies, choke them and break their necks, and use guns and knives to kill soldiers. Blood appears around wounds. Assuming the role of a ghost, players can possess enemies and make them kill themselves. There are also scenes of torture, and one scenario depicts a trio of men attacking a young woman in a failed attempt to rape her although there is no sex or nudity there is Another scene shows a character propositioning fellatio, and yet another has the player's character actively delivering a baby only side angles with bare thighs are shown there is constant strong language used and there is smoking and drinking used such as beer and marijuana.
This Game Is amazing, But dissapointing, compared to i would give the game 6.5 their is one sex scene which is two people kissing, and a woman having a baby. The game is emotional but has many flaws. check out the ign review of beyond two souls, it will give you more information, but i wont let my chilldren play this
