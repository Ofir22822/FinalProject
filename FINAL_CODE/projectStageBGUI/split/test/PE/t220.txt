 don't really like CoD games at all, the only other ones I actually like are WaW and IW. I'm rating this an 18+ mainly for the campaign, but for Multiplayer I'd rate it a 15+ and Warzone is a 13+. This game is actually incredible and the characters and story-telling are phenomenal. Overall rating: 9.5/10 and 5/5 stars. 18+ for Frequent strong bloody violence, war horror, threat, gore and language
This may be a bit biased, but I think 11 and up is a good age range to allow kids to play this. I started playing COD (Call of Duty) around the age of 2 (Bio dad was a Marine and this was his escape) and I would often play with him. I realized that kids weren't allowed to play it once I started school, but once I hit around 5th, kids were always asking to play one COD game or another. As long as you remind your kid that you shouldnt (for some kids, the word cant would be better) do this in real life and that its only just a game. If you hear them trash talking on Multiplayer with friends or just fellow gamers, dont stress, it only makes the game more hype and exciting (bear in mind, if your kid is sensative, don't let them play online until you think they have grown some thick skin, COD is one extremely toxic game - may have cooled down since I last played COD last). I also suggest playing video games with your kids even if you have no clue, it creates memories for both of you and is a blast. 5 start game.
Why is this 18+. Not nearly as bad as some Tom Clancy shooters, violent but not overly bloody and gory
Hi I am just here to let you all know that the campaign in this game can be very hard hitting because you do play as a kid with a gun killing people. other than that I think this is a fun game with a fun multiplayer but play the campaign with your kids because is has moments where it left me wondering how this is on the market today. So yes this game should be for kids over 14 if they play campaign or just don't install the campaign. also if someone is reading this and thinking I am just a hater on this game well I have 100 hours on this game. sorry for any errors I made I just don't care to fix them
It is fine you can turn off button swearing. I do think that the campaign or story mode is like it has actual war stuff. So if your kid can’t handle like some stuff were it is like. A little dark and kind of scary. there is auto subtitles which it will say the bad words you can turn off gore but it doesn’t turn off blood completely instead of body parts flying around it’s just one body but they still
