 He's only 12 and we played together for 2 hours. He enjoyed it extremely much and asked if I could buy it for him. I said yes because, I've played it for over 45 hours and I am excited to let you know that this game is perfect. The game is rated M, and it is rated this for language, violence, and nudity. I want to let you know that the violence in this game is low to none. When you shoot someone, small puffs of blood come out of the enemy. But, it is not overly graphic. There is no gore, or at least I haven't seen any so far, and language is in there. The language is definitely the biggest factor for rating this game M but, even that is hard to find. The main character curses using the words S**t and B***h once or twice every 15-25 minutes. This is extremely low for a M rated game. Also, the F word is used three times in the entire game so far. These times were only in the story mode/campaign and they were from the Irish. The Irish are not a main part of the story and can be bypassed if wanted. That's it for language. For nudity, there is only one thing: horse genitalia. Horses have these, but they are only found it you are deliberately looking for them, you would have to kill your own horse so that it falls over and then you would have to get a weapon with a scope to see them. They are invisible to the naked eye. That's pretty much it aside from one scene in the entire story where you can go and purchase a deluxe bath for a large portion of money. The deluxe bath has no more gains to it from the regular bath except for a lady, fully clothed, comes in and bathes you. No nudity is shown, not even for a second and only one time does she put her hand deep into the water and bring it up to wash your arm. It looks as if had she might be washing your character's unmentionables but, it was confirmed by the director of the game that she is just getting her hand wet to wash off the mud off your arm. Finally, that's it. I will update this review if I find anything else that is not family-friendly but, right now I can't find anything that isn't. Thanks for spending the time to read this and I would definitely recommend buying this for your child if they are into the old West. Thanks again and have a good day!
This game has blood language but any mature 12 year old should know this language and not be affected. There is partial nudity for like a second in the whole game.
I am so glad to say that red dead redemption 2 is coming out with a setting to turn off the very little blood that is shown
