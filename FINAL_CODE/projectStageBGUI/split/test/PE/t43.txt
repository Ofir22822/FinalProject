 drag a women into a bar but there all laughing. There’s no rape in this game what’s so ever. There’s also no other sexual stuff in the game. Days Gone is a wonderful game for teens and will be enjoyed by many who want a good story and fun game.
I’m a Christian dad of two boys (12 and 14). They love video games and really wanted Day Gone. Once they told me that it’s a zombie game, I decided to let them get it and see how bad it was. At first I didn’t really know what to expect but when I started to watch my sons I was surprised by how good it was. The game is about a biker in the apocalypse searching for his lost wife. Days Gone has a story that will take the player on a fun and memorable adventure. I enjoyed playing with my sons for a few hours. Decon, the protagonist is a really well done character and fun to play as. Days Gone is a zombie game though so there’s lots of zombie bashing but I was very surprised by how little blood and gore there was. Zombie games usually have lots of gore but this one lacks even blood. Now, the profanity in the game is frequent but can be disabled in the settings. After playing with my sons for a while I decided that the game was ok for them. It is an amazing game for teens. The game does have one mission though where you get drugs for a character but there prescription drugs. Another thing to mention is that the so called rape scene is nothing like rape. Some men are dragging a women into a bar, but the women is laughing with the men. Not even the dirtiest minds would think of this as rape. Overall, Days Gone is an amazing and wonderful game for teens who want a great story and hours of fun.
This game has some violent scenes but I think that it should be fine for 13 year olds. As a parent of 2 children my 14 year old loves this game and really recommends this game.
