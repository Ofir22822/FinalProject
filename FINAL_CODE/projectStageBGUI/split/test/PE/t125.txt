 Very good.
Moving and Engaging
Entertaining, Educational, and Emotional!!!
Wise and interesting game. A lot of emotions and a lot of historical knowledge.
Was looking for a non-shooter game for Xbox One for my 11-year-old son, who tends to be interested in history. This was just right. The challenges and story are keep him engaged and even his older sister, who isn't really into history, wants to play. Unlike many games, it is fun for the whole family to sit and watch and talk about, so it is a way to spend time together while still allowing video game time.
Absolutely a fantastic game! It's a great way to learn more about World War l and to test your puzzle skills! It is also very touching as the story of the characters you play as continue with the game. Some may even cry at some moments (Yeah, it's that touching; even I cried at some moments!). Altogether, this game is definitely a must-have for everyone!
Amazing
How can I switch to different weapon while I’m in a match in bullet force on freegames66?
Great concept utterly fails in execution.
Racing on ceilings and walls sounds fun, until you actually do it. Literally everything feels off and clunky and the steering has no oomph to it it feels like your steering a hoverboard with static stop and go and no drifting...and it's simply just NOT FUN to play or drive. The gripping itself on vertical surfaces and ceilings is finnicky and illogical with the physics of it all being confusing as you become dislodged or unable to race as you want many times. This just adds to the tedium and frustration of the other uninspiring elements of the game. I long for the days of demos again as this is the 3rd or 4rth racer that has been very sub par that I purchased without trying first. This just truly fails to be fun on any level.
Violent
Best Game
Gory fantasy violence
It's rated for m 17+ and don't let under 17 play
nice game,me and my friend are playing it right now!!! bad ice cream 3 on hudgames is the best game
Good action RPG, almost up to the standard of it's incredibly good predecessors. There is plenty of violence here, but it is all fantasy violence in a non-too-realistic style.
Hokuto no ken fans need this game
You're wrong about the positive role model thing.
The game gives a good role model (though I think this may be unintentional). For long time fans, this game is great. The battles are satisfying and fun. The game can even be fun if you have never read the manga or watched the anime. Kenshiro is a good role model and what he does in the game can teach a lesson (not killing the bad as a lesson but trying to do the right thing) However him being a good role model is something some people may thing and others wont. Overall: fun and great over the top gameplay mixed with a storyline.
Kenshiro is a good role model and of
