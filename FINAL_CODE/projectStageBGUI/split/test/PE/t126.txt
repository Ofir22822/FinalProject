 course he has to kill because its set in a post apocalyptic world. He only kills evil people and protects innocent people (heck he even gives them food and water when they are about to starve or die from thirst). Just because a character fights evil doers does not make him a bad role model. Also the post apocalyptic theme like others with that theme don't have that much law so of course the hero has to kill the baddies to protect the innocent. Also if you keep criticizing the heroes fighting bad guys you're going to make your self look like a villain apologist.
My kid had this game 7/10
My son bought this game it looks ok to me every now and then there are damn you and sh**t every hour in the game but other wise it is ok for 10 to 12 year old kids to play I hope this helps your disigin on this game
Not as bad as you think
The violence has almost no blood at all.
GREAT FOR ANY FAN OF THE ANIME/MANGA!
The game is only rated T (For teen) because of the language (the words sh*t and a**hole are sometimes said) the violence is about 5/10 there is mild blood but its to over the top to be taken seriously by anyone over the age of 10 and as for sex the character Momo Yaoyorozu has large breasts and her costume shows cleavage and another female character Himiko Toga has a short skirt but any kid who has seen Sailor Moon should be fine with that. So this game is good for anyone 12+
This shouldn’t be an 18 rated game.
Other Reviews Are Over Dramatic!
Red Dead Redemption 2 Is a great game that any parent should allow their kid to play!
For kids 12 and older
New update attends to younger players
Lots of gore and mature themes.
So glad this update is coming to the amazing world of red dead redemption 2
SO GLAD THERE IS A CHILDRENS MODE SOON
Amazing depth!
It’s fine
Too much nudity?
Fantastic Open World adventure, has gory violence.
Only allow your kid to play if they are willing to stay on the side of good honor.
Great Game
Great for anger
Red Dead Redemption - A Masterpiece
amazing
Amazing for Kids and Adults
AMAZING BUT GRAPHIC
First of all I think this game is fantastic, and would be a shame for people 13 and over to miss out on. I pre ordered it for myself as I loved the first one, my son who is 13 found out and was begging me to let him play when it was released but I said no. I said that as I didn’t know how the game was gonna be like but I have now played it so I shall give a review on it. Let’s talk about language first. The language in this game is quite good for an 18 rated game what I mean is that there is swearing every single second. The worst the language gets is a few F words, I have played a lot of
