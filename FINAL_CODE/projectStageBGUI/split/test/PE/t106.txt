I'm adding to this discussion to clarify that the game itself isn't the least bit scary or graphic. To start, you pick a color for your character along with a silly hat. If you're the "imposter," you are indeed supposed to kill the "crew mates" but you do it by pushing a button when you're standing next to them. You don't choose how they're killed and there's nothing malicious about it. They fall over and look like brightly colored little hams with one big bone sticking out. It's just silly. I also want to add my own kids' experience with the oft-mentioned chat feature. It's mostly been innocent, but one player mentioned at the start of a game that they were planning to kill themselves (in real life). My 16-year-old chatted a bit with this person and determined that they sounded serious, so she gave them the suicide prevention hotline number and urged them to seek help (they said they would). She and my 11-year-old son play this game a lot and 99% of the time, nothing bad happens, but you just never know what anyone will say. We've also seen some hateful messages, ostensibly from Trump supporters (they name their characters Trump2020, etc.). Bottom line - if you're 100% sure your kids know not to share any personal information in chats and can just ignore unpleasantries, Among Us is fine for any age, but you should keep an eye on it.
Among Us is a good game for teaching children the ins and outs of deductive reasoning and socialization. The cartoonish violence is fun and it's a good game to get a group of people together and enjoy. A passing fad to enjoy while it lasts.
My daughter and I both enjoy playing. However it is disappointing when a group of kids/adults play as a group. Chatting or on a call with each other and gang up against others. Then again that is ok but what is not ok is belittling them. Calling them suckers and hos because they were caught as the imposter. Word of advice from this mom is to be present. If your kids are in a room with only 4 people chances are 2 or 3 of them are working together and can get nasty to the single person out.
Parents should know that, in terms of gameplay, "Among Us" isn't very objectionable; getting killed will catch you by surprise at first, but the animations are mild and cartoony. The real issue here is in public lobbies, in which strong language and names of a sexual nature are common ("Horny boy/girl"
