 have sex with anyone. Male genitals are shown but in a non-sexual way. I think a mature 12-13 yo should be able to handle this game.
Not appropriate for younger kids

Great game for just about everyone
Although there is an option to choose a "Kids" or "Just Dance" version, the "Kids" version is incredibly cheesy and more for younger children. The "Just Dance" version has more songs for older kids but limited song choices. The outfits in most songs are inappropriate and most of the songs suggest sex or drinking. It's really hard trying to enjoy dancing with my 10 year old daughter when what we are dancing to is so provocative. Nope! In order to have more of a song variety, you have to buy the subscription to unlimited. Otherwise, you are trying to earn more songs.
JUST DANCE 2019 is the latest entry in Ubisoft's long-running, best-selling rhythm and dance gaming franchise. It's time to hit the dance floor once again and move to the groove of 40 different dance songs, featuring artists such as The Weekend with Daft Punk, Britney Spears, and K-Pop sensation BIGBANG. You can choose your dance routine or let the game learn from you and make personalized suggestions catered to your style and tastes. Parents can get the kids in on the fun and get a little extra exercise too with eight exclusive choreographed routines focused on healthy movements, created with the help of kids' development experts. And since no one should ever have to dance alone, load up the free Just Dance app on your iOS or Android smartphone and bring up to six people to the dance party. — What’s in the game? Minor Language - Very mild language (e.g., "damn") occasionally pops up in song lyrics. Some of the song lyrics occasionally reference drinking alcohol.
I think you should check the songs before someone plays it, it causes flashy lights bad for your eyes sometimes but not many it's still a children's exercise game.
The newest installment of one of the world's most iconic games is great! Great songs. However many songs have some swears and or references to drinking/sex. Words like Damn ,Hella, Bed, and Motherfricken are uncensored.References to chugging vodka, Waking up in a mans bed, abusive girlfriend as well. There is a kids mode however for the little ones. Overall this game is must get this holiday season or just in general.
Very challenging and dark game for older kids
So Good it Started a New Genera of Game: A Review for Parents that are not Familiar with this Game
Good for the uninitiated. Good for most teens.
Not very offensive or violent, some slightly questionable visuals and actions take place but nothing too bad, if anything it's more scary and atmospheric. Very hard and challenging game for younger people, I've beat it twice now and only with me giving him some tips has my son beat this game (he was ready to give up).
In my opinion, at the time of the
