 the money. It also has a great DLC! And the best part is that it has a whole continuation of the story Post-Credit.
It's a fun game, but is harder to control for younger kids. There isn't too much to do after you complete the game, unless you buy extra stuff.
First of all, I've played almost every Pok?mon game since Red + Blue The game is enjoyable, but compared to old entries to the series, I found it quite dissapointing. Most of all, I disliked the pacing of the 'story', because it all happens in the last 10 minutes of the game. If you want to play Pok?mon, you should probably just get Sun + Moon instead, they're better in my opinion
I have Pok?mon Shield myself, and I think it’s pretty good! The animations for Pok?mon moves aren’t really scary or violent at all, and the gameplay and story is fun, but yeah, the idea of training animal-like creatures for combat is a little extreme, but parents shouldn’t not get this game just because of that. But on the other hand, if you don’t know your types or aren’t used to Pok?mon and battling other players online, it can be a little frustrating, but overall, if your kids are Pok?mon fans, it’s a good game to get as a present, and is easy to learn how to play.
It is a fun game but sometimes stresfull
I really love playing this game, the graphics are great, the camping and cooking minigame things are cool, the story is pretty good but almost the same as other games as far as I can tell. These games help younger folks learn about the value of teamwork and such. Also the Dynamax mechanic is cool PS Im sorry I have no grammar skils whatsoever
This is my favorite Pok?mon game, I do miss mega evolution and some other things from previous generations, I don’t see why this game has lots of hate, but besides that, this game is for kids but with some very mild problems that just depends on your Conscience, this is a short swim suit outfit that you can get from beating the 2nd Gym (Nessa) which is revealing, there is also no filter to names, so you will definitely find some inappropriate user names while in Internet connection mode but honestly that’s it, this is a great Pok?mon game for people new to Pok?mon, tho I don’t agree with the price (59.99 USD$) I still love the Pok?mon franchise This game also has inspiring messages and a great story, and you can learn good lessons form this game
Along with all Pokemon games, this one is a masterpiece. Great for all ages. I highly recommend diving into this wonderful world, and enjoying what it has to offer.
I wouldn't consider myself a super fan of the Pok?mon series, but I have taken a liking to the games. I've played many of them, but I have never seen a game as beautiful and smooth-running as this. The
