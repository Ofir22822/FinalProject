 game follows the story of your character and his/her rival, Hop, questing to become the newest Champion of the league. I haven't finished the game as of when I post this, but so far, it is the best Pok?mon game I have ever played. It has an amazing storyline and positive messages about never giving up and trying your best. The only thing I would say is that only kids 8+ should play this because firstly, the controls are a little bit complicated, and secondly, there are some mildly scary scenes that I think anybody 6 or under might be scared by. But aside from that, this is the best Pok?mon game I, personally, have ever played. The developers really did a great job.
It is a great game although there are women that wear bikinis but little kids don't know and it always happens at the beach. come on
I am a huge Pok?mon fan this is grate for all people 6 and up also the game is rated E.
The game Pokemon Sword/Shield is a adventure/role-playing game where you explore, challenge gyms, and most importantly: catch Pokemon! If you are not entirely sure what Pokemon is, Pokemon is a game that was made in the 1990's that is practically the same as this game other then the fact that there were way less Pokemon then there are now. Honestly, this game is really good, the animation and graphics have received a very much needed update from its previous titles. (There are many different titles in the Pokemon franchise) The story is pretty good compared to some of the previous games, but not the best. The pokedex has a even number of 400, which is awesome! Something that they added to the game that I love is the wild zone! The wild zone is an area that you are free to explore whenever you feel like it, so kind of like a open world area. One thing that has not really changed over the years is the Pokemon battling, it is very cartoon-like and not very graphic using a rock-paper-scissors style of battle. Overall I must say this is a fitting game for the Pokemon franchise, If you are a hardcore fan or new... then join the fun. And welcome to the world of Pokemon!
This game grabbed your attention and doesn’t let go! The kid friendly, fun nature of the game that has come to be expected from the Pok?mon brand, with kids of any age looking forward to play the game. Fans of all ages can play Pok?mon sword/shield, and different levels of completion can be achieved depending on how you like to play the game.
Ignore the hate, Pokemon Sw/Sh is great
As someone who is a fan of Pokemon, it lived up. Graphics are sure, not impressive but very vibrant and colorful, could use some polish, New Pokemon are unique and the new stuff added will depend if you like it. Ignore the hate from the fans, it is great.
