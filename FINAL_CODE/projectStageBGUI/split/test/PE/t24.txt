 is gonna have a lot of trouble with a game like this. (sorry for the typos i came across this at work and just had to say something on here for the parents looking for a fun game or anybody who came across this as their only review of this game. Ignore the person who reviewed it unless you want this for a child under 12.)
its a great game
This is a great game me and my kids love
its the best game I have seen let your kids play the game
This game is ok for children of any age over 11 and overall pretty good
Very Good for children 9 and up.
It shows that life isn't always how you want it to be. Kids should know that while he/she is growing up. Especially at ages 9+.
Amazing!
Yes
Fun game
Educational value should have 5 dots.
It helps a kids imagination, Totally recommend
Second best game ever next to Minion Rush
Very fun game, Has very mild violence, It can be ages 8 and up.
How does this get 4 dots for education, the fact that violence gets 1 dot, it should have no dots. Seriously, Common sense, you need to improve your expert reviews, and add a new thing that gives you a choice to vote from 0-5 dots, and the overall votes is the dots out of 5.
the gore and blood can be turned off
The game is very slow compared to other fighting games, but this isn't always a bad thing as it gives you time to think. Easy to pickup, yet hard to master. Also, I disagree with what Harold cooper said, while the blood can be turned off, some of the characters may look scary to younger children. Some females are slightly sexulized in looks. If your children are mature, however then its fine if you let SOME kids under 13 play (namely 11 12 13).However some people may consider the game over the top in violence, (not that true as some previous games were more over the top).
Terrible piece of garbage full of bugs
This game is full of bugs and glitches literally when playing this on my ps4 my game crashed 6 times after playing for 8 hours that’s when I just rage quitted the game and am never gonna play again it’s a waste of money a lack of f**king that the developers put towards making this game it’s no wonder why the game has a score of 64 on metacritic it’s a pretty shitty game honestly and a waste of money and time don’t buy this game you will regret it.
Jason!
A Killer Game Worth Playing
Good game, with choices and consequences
Alright for kids
This game has no inappropriate content
Very good game but can get quite freaky
Heavy Rain will pull at your heartstrings!!
Incredible game
Depends on your child's behavior and maturity
Fantastic, well-written dark psychological thriller game with unique twists.
Not for Kids
This game is fantastic, but not for the younger audience.
I never played the game, but I watched a walkthrough
Sexual content makes it very mature.
not for kids.
