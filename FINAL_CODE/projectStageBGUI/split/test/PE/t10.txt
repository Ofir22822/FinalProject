 sore, not very compelling, too simple and repative or all of the above. Seemingly an excuse to make a cheap game with a low budget with the glaring problems. NOT SO HERE. If anyone remembers the Prince of Persia on PC, it was pixelated, but with realistic motion and engaging gameplay. Mix that with a classic Dungeons And Dragons theme with a literal storybook narrative and you have this. At first the learning curve seems a bit steep, but the mechanics of the gameplay show you the ropes little by little and you catch on a a bit more with each try. So you never hit a wall you can't level up past or accomplish so you don't beat your head against the wall. There CAN be a grind to get your character leveled, but each stab at any particular dungeon is randomly generated, and not in a cheap way, so that each run feels different with new challenges and puzzles to uncover. I never realized this until the third time and it makes each try more compelling instead of repetative and annoying. Within a few hours I unlocked several new abilities and became familiar enough that I was plowing through enemies "like a boss" where I had once felt intimidated. You can unlock new missions and characters by yourself or with local co-op, meaning you are not limited to 'online only' players and can just sit with a friend on the same console with an extra controller (very rare any more). No lie though, the buttons and what they do for trinkets, abilities and so forth take some time to get aquainted, but the game runs so smooth and the combat is deep enough that you'll WANT to take a few moments to get to know your layout, which is also customizable to change the buttons and what they do if you so desire. I have NEVER recommended a pixel art game before and have not recommended a true local co-op game of this ilk since Castle Crashers. Honestly, the game is downright beautiful at times and superbly animated. But if any of the above sounds compelling, look into this one for sure because I think it's a rare find, and to get my wife to drop her slow paced puzzle phone game to play an action RPG is almost impossible. Seriously.... I just may have to grind out her character a bit, but I'm fine with that. This is truly an 'easy to pick up' game that has depth if you want it. This game reminds me of the best Fantasy movie elements of the 80s and 90s movies, LOTR, Prince of Persia, Gauntlet and much of the best things of each rolled into one place. I'm loving it in so many ways. Only reason it's not a 5 star review is that this game does NOT have a difficulty setting and may be too frustrating for kids making this a take it or leave it scenario for
