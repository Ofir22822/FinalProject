 There is no sex, but Widowmaker (the main sniper) does a sort of ballet dance, and you can see her knickers. Several female heroes are scantily-clad, including some skins are just a bikini or crop top. You can join groups to group up and you can join group chat, team chat and match chat to chat to people so you can co-ordinate your attacks (This option can be switched off). Great role models to fight for the greater good of the world, and is very easy to play and use. The hero backgrounds are amazing and if you watch the short cinematics on YouTube, you can find out everything. There are in-game purchases with credits you can find in loot boxes, and you can buy loot boxes with real money if you want to. One specific hero, McCree, is always shown smoking a cigar, with a little smoke rising from it. Overall a brilliant game and I hope people consider my review, even though I am only a kid.
I think that this game is much better than fortnite and that the only reason that there is any smoking points on this is because there is a cowboy character that has a cigarette. He doesn't even have it in the game, just in the cinematic. Also, maybe there is some revealing things on a certain character, but it's very harmless and just don't pay attention. Just be wary of voice chat on PC, but not so much on console. Toxicity is abundant. Just be wary of voice chat in this game. Here is how toxicity is in that game. Toxic_33: omg ur so bad get off this game! Stupid bronze scum. Everyone else: k Also if you play competitive, please at least use the communication wheel and don't play if you aren't gonna take it seriously. Also don't instalock someone that you don't need. You might get flamed. Please don't main bastion. Please don't main Mei either. Also if you are gonna be sad about your rank, because you are a support in bronze, 50% of the time its because you main Moira and dont heal. Just remember that you can get good if you try and play more. Also play good characters.
I Got This For My 9th Birthday And There Is Nothing In It Compared To Movies As a DISNEY Movie Has More Gore Than This (POTC) Sure People Can Be Toxic But Same Could Be Said For Any Game And I Get That I Am a Kid But Minecraft Could Get a Older Rating Because Of a Toxic Community And Most Parents Let Their Kids Play Games Like COD And Halo Which Halo Is Rated The Same (Teen) So Think About It Like That
this game is amazing. all you other parent are wrong, the violence is very mild. as for the consumerism, it would be OK to let you child buy a few loot boxes, but dont let them spend 600$ on your credidt card. overall great game.
