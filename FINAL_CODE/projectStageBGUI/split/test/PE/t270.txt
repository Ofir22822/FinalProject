 the Game Browser but that's not really a problem.
Overwatch is a friendly first person shooter game with epic characters. There is not that much blood in Overwatch. But sometimes when Soilder 76 gets hit he mutters damn it under his breath but that's really it in terms of swearing. There is no drinking or drugs in the game either. And some positive messages and good role modes.
i played this for so much time that i missed my bed time, its a really really fun game, its mostly battling robots and not real people. So just get up and play!
This is a pretty fun game. There’s a lot of diversity in play, and actually no blood. The only curse words are a few “damn”s thrown around, but otherwise it’s clean. It does promote team play, which is great, but there is a problem in that it’s also an internet troll’s paradise. Players have access to both text and voice chat, so you can directly talk to other players. There is a profanity filter option available for text chat, but not for voice chat. You can mute and block players, however, so that’s nice. Players can also grief or throw games by not doing their part, interfering with allied players, and similar practices. Basically, you can say or do anything and it’s likely you won’t have any punishment besides a mute for a few days. That is most people’s problem with the game, at least when it comes to social features. But most of the time, you will find players who want to have a good time, just like you or your kid. Now, about the characters. There is one character, McCree, who smokes a cigar, and McCree and a few other characters reference alcoholic drinks, but none is actually shown in game. There is some fan service in Widowmaker (possible Mercy and Tracer, depending on who you ask), so just know that. There is so actual sex or nudity in the game. The game can also be VERY rage inducing. There are times that you may not be doing well, or your team isn’t communicating, and you just get mad. At those times, it’s better to log off and take a break. It’s also pretty addictive sometimes, so I would advise parents to set time limits. It’s for their own good. One last thing: there is a lot of consumerism. When a player levels up, they gain a loot box. Look boxes give you, well, in-game loot, like skins and sprays. But they are purchasable, and they cost a surprising amount, about a dollar a box. Since you can’t directly buy loot you want with money, you will need to either rack up currency, which takes a long time, or buy boxes, which give you totally random loot. This leads to many players buying a lot of boxes in hopes to get something they want. Overall, Overwatch is very fun, but no game is without flaw. The seemingly uncontrollable social mechanics
