You want your kids to be exposed to
Parents need to know that game-breaking glitches plague this dissapointing game. If you have played Fallout 4 then you know what to expect from this game. However, Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game. I usually really like MMO games and survival post-appocalyptic games, but this was a dissapointment. Even if you decide to play it, you should be warned about the content. Violence is pretty frequent and graphic, with heads and limbs being shot off. Combat is almost required to survive and progress. The game also includes occasional strong language with uses of f--k and s--t and a few sexual references. If you are an adult then I reccomend that you play Fallout 4 instead. If you are a kid or young teen then I reccomend that you stay away from this one. It isn't worth your time. I hope that Bethesda (the game developers) can do better with the next Fallout game. This game had lots of potential.
This Is a very good game, my kid has wanted to play fallout 4 for a while but that game unlike this one was to violent and not appropriate. I found that this game was a good alternative because it is the sequel to Fallout 4 and I do not see any problems with it, in my opinion this game should be Rated Teen and not M.
The Good: Fallout 76's content is very simple and easy to understand. Your kids will have a good time exploring a massive map with others. There is no sexual content, and the sense of freedom is high. The Bad: Fallout 76 is filled with profanity, though the F-bomb is not dropped very often, thankfully. The violence is high, as there is a plethura of weapons and explosives to use. The landscape is filled with mutated creatures and evil robots who will try to exterminate you. Friendly NPCs can be killed for little more than fun. The Ugly: Fallout 76 is an online only game, and therefore kids and people alike will experience other people's choices, like swearing over online chat, underdressing or dressing immodestly, and straight up murdering you for fun. The Verdict: I recommend this for teenagers and Adults which understand that this is not real, and are mature enough to not repeat actions experienced in the game in the real world.
Whilst Fallout 76 on the surface appears violent, it isn't always about violence. There are some times when you engage
