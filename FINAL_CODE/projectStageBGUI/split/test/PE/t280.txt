 lot of these. They really make it impossible to win a game reasons like they need to be told when to ult, where to go, ect. even then they don't even join team so you can't help them. Sometimes they get a friend to carry them up to your level or let someone get on there account or someone join team chats and says "This is my brothers account..." and it gets very annoying. This is the cause of a lot of my losses. Problem D: (9/10 this will happen) Toxic Players They just make the game bad to play. All they do is insult the team and say they're doing everything right while your doing everything wrong which will cause a lack of cooperation and can cause people to throw. This can also make you lose your games. 2. Blizzard Blizzard can't keep a server together and does odd things with the game that can really screw it over. Problem A: (Very common/ Not Very Common) Server Problems People that play this game might not understand what I mean at first but just hear me out. (This also is similar to no mics problem.) When a new event comes out it makes the game very difficult to get on because of server problems not as common but can be annoying. But one of the most annoying things that is very common is when you see the error code 10007. This means that for some reason you can't get into voice chat and it is very annoying for all users. I don't know the cause of it is, but I think it's that you can't connect to the voice server. Never the less it's very annoying. Problem B: (Can’t really rate this) The 'nerfs' and 'buffs' Blizzard has a way of when they buff something they make it way to overpowered and just leave it for the whole community to get very annoyed and it's just annoying. The fact that Sombra can hack someone in .65 seconds is enough to prove this point alone. Anyone that plays the game knows what I mean. Problem C: (Most of the time) Placements The ranks are completely broken and when you do the placement matches and win all of them you still can be placed lower than you were in the previous season which is very annoying and should be fixed. To be honest placements shouldn't be in the game for people who have already completed them once because they don't really move that much at all, but they do have a tendency to move people down sr. This is what I think is about Blizzards game Overwatch. Feel free to use this comment in anyway and to tell me what you think of my ideas.
Okay, so overwatch is a super cool game. Some people say it is so violent with blood! Okay, I have not seen blood once in this game, and neither has my friend who has played it for 3
