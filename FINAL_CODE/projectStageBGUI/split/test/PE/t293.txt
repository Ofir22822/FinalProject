 voice chat- HOWEVER, you will not hear other's voices if you do not opt into using your own voice. Stay out of voice chat, and leave the written chat filter on to avoid anything more than mild language. Finally, the cowboy character McCree, smokes a cigar. There are also a couple references to alcohol, such as something along the lines of- "You know, Hanzo, that sake ain't half bad... But I think I prefer whiskey myself.", or just simply "Beer!" But, you do not hear these lines very frequently. That's everything I can think of to be aware of, as far as age rating goes. Have fun, and stay safe!
Everything about what they said in the video review was right. Even the voice chat, and people can say bad words a lot. Mostly because of raging on their team because they suck. But, there is a way to turn off voice chat in two ways: One is to go to options and lower the voice chat volume and Two is to turn off voice chat. I have this game on my xbox one s and I was annoyed of all the screaming of other players. So I took 5 minutes to look in the options and I found the answers, or the two ways to turn off voice chat.
This game is a fun game with some non-graphic violence. It is fairly easy to learn, especially if the player has first-person shooter experience. There is little blood, just when you are taking damage there is unrealistic red at the corners of the screen. Other than that, this game is a pretty good game if you are sensitive about your kids playing shooter games because it is not too violent and fairly easy to learn. There is open chat since this is an all online game so there is unmoderated chat and there can be dirty language.
This game is an all multiplayer shooter, so language could be heard over open chat. But you can mute other players so thats not really a problem. Barely any blood. Ages 9+ can handle it. Could be E10+ probably.
common sense media always over exaggerate if its a shooter this is literally a shooter for kids it is not even violent and the chat can be disabled thank you for reading :)
This game is amazing for teens-adults that love the FPS genre. Though, i can't help but notice the reviews obviously from fake kid-accounts pretending to be adults just to give the game a really under-rated age-group, like "3 to 9+", if you hand this game to a 3 year old he would barely even know how to open the disc case. the game isn't that violent to be honest, the most you get is the smallest bit of gore, which is (at the most) a splash of red out of mid-air in front of an enemy. I'd say that this game is at the very least appropriate for a 12 year old. As for the content,
