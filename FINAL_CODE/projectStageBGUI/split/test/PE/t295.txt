 game 10+ kids should be able to enjoy
This is my friend's favorite video game, and she told me about the Free Weekend. I downloaded and played Overwatch, and lemme just say: it's FUN and ADDICTING. The heroes are all unique and colorful in their own way. This game teaches skill and strategy, and almost doesn't focus a lot on violence. Now I'm trying to convince my dad to buy this game.
It is literally the cleanest fps game since splatoon
I know it's rated T for Teen, but really, it's not that bad. There's barely any blood and you can only see it if you are really close. No gore. Sometimes there is some language, but it's not strong (it's the D-A word if you were wondering), as long as your kid is mature, I think you should get it for them. Oh, and I forgot to tell you that one character smokes, and another character you can see the side of their breasts.
UNFAIR HEROES AND LOOTBOXES SUCK
Amazing, but don't play competitively if you're young :/
Overwatch
Overwatch is more kid friendlier than the rest of the First person shooter games.

I've been playing Overwatch since it first released. I got the origins edition, and the full game on pc to show my support. Many things are great about this game, for example, once you pay for the game, you don't have to pay for anything else after unless you want to. Every review I've seen so far just addresses the wonderland full of battles and characters, but one thing I love about the game is the strategy. It forces you to play to your team's strengths and weaknesses, and it forces you to do what you have to
