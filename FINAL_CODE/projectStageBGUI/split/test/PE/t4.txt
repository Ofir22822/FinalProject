Staple suggestive themes and bare bones delivery mire a once 'must have' franchise.

Better then mortal combat! (Though that game is really good)
For parents, read the Common Sense review as I won't reiterate the same points. As far as replayable content and controls, this is another fine rendition of very responsive and quick controls. Unfortunately, with the most bare bones delivery set in comic book form and the cutback of a huge part of it's roster with only a handful of new fighters, this is perhaps the most disappointing Street Fighter game to date. Although this title knows very little rivalry in quality, even in it's worst renditions, this was considered a step back and a letdown to most fans of the franchise. Also, after the crossover Street Fighter X Tekken game with it's 2 on 2 features and massive roster, this game conveys a comparatively minimalistic feel with a huge missing lineup of characters and modes found in previous games. Being a Playstation exclusive should not entice one to buy a PS4 console as SF4 and X Tekken were superior games despite the fact they are not as High Defintion, but they both more than make up for this in sheer content and replayability.
This game is definitely a great fighting game. Beginners can 'button mash' to victory, whereas more experienced players (like me) can string together advanced combos to win. A must-have for any gamer over 10.
A all around fun game me and my 12 year old love this game! But sadly when ever we VS he usually beats me ):
Good kids game

Sexualalized dancing
Tamer then Just Dance 2018, but still questionable in places.
Inappropriate Choreography and Negative Lyrics
Great for all ages to stay active in the cold!
Great!
In my personal opinion, I find this game to be extremely fun and a convenient way to get exercise. Catchy songs, fun dance steps, etc. However, I have been reading other parent reviews that have been stating that this game is
