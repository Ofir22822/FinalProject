 at most. The most inappropriate outfit is Sindel's outfit with her skin being showed going down directly in between her breasts which are pretty pushed together. The buttocks shown in the game is very minor with a little butt out on the sides of the outfit. overall this is a great game and all the stuff in the game listed is very exaggerated so it kinda lessens the the violence but kinda. only 16+ if your child can handle excessive violence.
This game really isn’t that terrible if you let your kids play games like resident evil this game really isn’t all that different my kids are 12 and they love this game there’s no sex or anything in this game and again like I said it’s not all that bad and there’s hardly any swearing in this game but I doubt your kids haven’t already said or heard these words before although that’s just my opinion have a nice day
Be warned that this game is packed ton of gruesome kills and sadistic behavior. 11 isn't nowhere near as bad as some previous ones like XL. It all just depends on the maturity of understanding that its just a game. If your child isn't mature enough for sadistic violence and gore I highly do not recommend it.
This game is stupendous. It has mind blowing graphics(unreal engine 3! Generation old!) and it plays very well. Language isn't the big issue for me. While there are quite a few "f bombs" that is overshadowed by the violence! Brains are being ripped out etc. This game is even more violent than doom eternal! Yes, it is! DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR KIDS
I played this game after my 17th birthday. My family's friends claimed this game that contains extremely inappropriate for under 17 years old. It's best game for over 17 years old.
The only thing is the extreme gore including brains being eaten, I know you seen that in zombie movies but that isnt the end, Eyes popping out, Heart and organ ripping, One fatality is that raiden cuts off the upper body and the small intestine and large intestine gets exposed etc I would rate it 18+ but if you dont do fatalities or brutalities, i would recommend 16+ then
To be honest I don’t k is much about video games but Mortal Kombat I knew for its blood, violence, sexual themes, and gore. But my son bought it and brought it home to play as soon as I saw what he was playing I was furious because his little brothers were watching. So I stood and waited but watching the actual gameplay I was surprised. I thought there would be almost naked girls, guts and blood everywhere but it was actually tame but when I saw the finish him screen I got scared. I thought could this damage my young child’s brain and cause trauma but my oldest just looked back my other two and just punched him in the knee. I was
