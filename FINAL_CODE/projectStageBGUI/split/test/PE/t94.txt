 and he is not effected by the game play.
Just Cause 4 is a huge improvement on it's predecessor, with improved controls, a great open-world map, and many new gadgets to mess around with. It's not perfect - the game still feels a bit clunky and the story is pretty straight forward with no twists or turns whatsoever. The main highlight of Just Cause 4 is definitely Rico's gadgets, I've honestly spent hours just messing around with them. The game just wouldn't be the same without them - can you imagine a Just Cause game without a grappling hook or wingsuit? Me neither. For both newcomers and veterans of the series, Just Cause 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new and exciting game to play. 8/10.
This game is very cool is a game left for 10/11 year old because of the violence other wise nice game but NOT 18!!
Very little blood. Cartoonish violence. No swearing. Ok for teens. PG13 stuff.
I think kids thirteen and up should be able to play it. It isn’t as violent as common sense media says it is.
Great game, good for all ages (almost)
It says just cause 4 has the f-word but it does not. I have heard it say the s-word twice.
If you are not happy with swearing in the game, there is a setting that will allow you to turn the voices off. Otherwise, it only has 2-3 swear words in the entire game. A little blood may come from the characters in the game. The corpses will despawn after 20 seconds or so. There will be burning bodies if you use an explosive near a NPC (non-playable character). The flame does nothing to the body and will despawn. I think this is a VERY good game and that you should get it soon. DLCs are not overpriced and are in a price range from 1$ to 15$.
This is a very nice game.It was violence but without blood.I think it’s ok.It has some bad words but I don’t think it’s a problem because the children at this age don’t know them
I personally love the Just Cause franchise. I think that Just Cause 4 is another great game with a lot of chaos! You can fly planes, drive cars, and sail boats! And the main thing you do is cause chaos! Heck, you can fly a plane into a tornado. Although there is a lot of violence, killing, gunfire, and explosions, it’s is pretty good. Although you can kill innocent bystanders, it is nothing that graphic. You basically just shoot them and there’s blood and they fall dead to the ground. Same with explosives, they fly up into the air and hit the ground dead. That’s just basically what it is like. Other than that and a few cursing and drug use, (some AI’s will be smoking or drinking) the feeling of using a rocket launcher at a enemy’s car or causing a huge gas tank
