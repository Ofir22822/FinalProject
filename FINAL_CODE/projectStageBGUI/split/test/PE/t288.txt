 can be very toxic, especially in competitive, and often threaten to false-report, and tell people to "kys" if they're doing bad. This has happened to me several times, because I am very terrible at this game, and get accused for "trolling" often. Overall, this game is no worse than something like Minecraft or Terraria. Overwatch promotes heroism, and doing the right thing, and I would suggest this to mature children.
the whole game is based off of killing characters on the opposite team.
Overwatch is a great game I’ve played tonnes of it and it’s great fun but common sense media why 13+ this game is not violent at all compared to many other FPS games and it’s great fun
it is not that violent i mean their are more kid friendly games like garden warfare 2 but only a little splash of blood so its also relay good with a wide range of characters and its bright colors so it is a realy good game
RrEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! get good m8.. also you should play CSGO OR PUBG INSTEAD FOR MORE TOXICiTTY!
Some of the characters have inspiring backstories like Lucio, but other characters are criminals. Overall there is little blood and little swearing. And the blood is a just quick flash of red. Since the blood is just a quick flash of red, younger kids can play it if red doesn't bother them. It is easy to play and super fun. The graphic are really good. Overall it is just a great game.
Its a fun game!
Some people say, 2+. NO VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER!!! Some people say, 16+. TOO VIOLENT!!! SHOULD BE M!!! TOXIC PLAYERS!!! DON't BUY!!! I think that if you merged these reviews, then this is what Overwatch is. It is not very violent. The only blood is a red splash when someone dies, and the players fall down and then re spawn when killed, similar to Minecraft. There are objectives, and the players usually aren't toxic at all. If there was an E-11+ rating, I would slip Overwatch under that category. It is not really an E-10 game, but I would say it is completely OK for Ages 10 and up. One of the problems with this game is that you need a really good computer to run it. I have a Dell XPS 15 9560 with a GTX 1050 and an Intel Core I5, and I still have to use medium graphics (Probably cause of 8GB ram.) Great game, however. Most of the characters are great role models, fighting for their countries or whatnot. Some of the only non-good role models are for example, The Reaper, who just says "die" and stuff like that, and is portrayed is a terrorist. That is the worst, though. There is no wonder how it won Game of The Year in 2016. Be careful with the consumerism, however, with any big game like this one there is lots.
You might think it's violent,but it's just as violent as a pg-rated marvel movie. There isn't strong suggestive themes which
