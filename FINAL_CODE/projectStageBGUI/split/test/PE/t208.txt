 Great mechanics and gameplay but the most disturbing stuff isn't the gore.

Campaign review: Big upgrade in terms of narrative and cutscenes
A pretty accurate review.
Very cool, VERY violent
Good canpagin
It's fine if your kid knows about war and knows not to say curses.
Review is garbage
Review the age rating
So underrated
Very disturbing imagery
Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a solid CoD, the best in many years. Typically CoD is gory, disturbing and brutally portrays war in an unforgiving way. This CoD is the most disturbing and makes No Russian from mw2 look like child's play compared to this. People burn alive, people are tortured and hung. You can kill civilians in front of their kids and there's a scene where you torture a guy and use his family as leverage. There are several scenes of dead children and executions via hanging or shooting. In terms of gore it's like every other recent CoD. Guns cause blood to realistically splatter on walls and floors, explosives and snipers can dismember people and even decapitate them. You can perform Mortal Kombat esque finishing moves where you slit enemies throats, snap necks and other ways of killing enemies. These clearly glamorise violence but they're optional, as is the gore. Dismemberment can be disabled. The game doesn't glamorise violence much however. It makes you feel bad for killing people in the campaign and portrays war as realistic as possible. It's a gritty, immersive game and is very fun overall. The multiplayer is a good mp. Lots of new innovative ideas and returing ones like vehicles are present and makes the game more realistic and gives these battles scale. Graphically it's gorgeous and is the best looking CoD yet. The guns feel and sound very authentic and realistic as does everything else. The killstreaks are the best yet. You can fly around in a helicopter, control a missile in first person and man a heavy turret and that's only a few. The customisation options are plentiful and it's easy to spend hours tuning your classes. Some maps feel a bit lacking but most are good. Spec ops is ok, not amazing but ok. Warzone is a great ideas and plays amazingly. It's free as well so if you're not sure about this game then try that first and decide for yourself. The campaign is amazing but isn't very long. Overall Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a good entry and has revitalised the franchise. This game is suitable for all 14+ or people with the maturity of a 14 year old.
