 original release back in 2011, it was visionary. It is absolutely brilliant in the way it treats the idea of RPGs (role playing games) and action-RPGs. People will still be talking about this game 50 years from now. Because of this game, there is now a genera of games being developed and released called 'Souls-Like' games. It is the successor to a game released way back in 2009 for PS3 called Demons Souls. Originally, there were no plans to release 'Demons Souls' outside of Japan because the makers of Demons Souls, 'FROM Software', felt that the extreme difficulty wouldn't appeal to Western gamers; especially those in the USA. Some copies of the game, still not translated from Japanese, made their way around and it quickly gained a cult like following. The aspect of the game that appealed to gamers around the world was the extreme difficulty and unforgiving nature of the gameplay; the very thing that prevented international release! So, after some time, a USA release was announced and then an eventual European release as well. The game sold modestly in USA and other countries but the revenue stream was significant enough that development for USA release began on a game that took the concept further. Not a sequel but a 'spiritual successor'. People who enjoyed this game and the sequels that followed got to experience something that had been missing from games for a long time. That being, a huge challenge with no hand-holding. There were 2 sequels (3 if you count Bloodborne, some count it, some don't) and then this remastered release. The improvements in the remaster over the original are improved multiplayer, improved framerate, slightly improved graphics, and port on a new platform, Nintendo Switch. Overall, the game looks more polished but there is a minimum of graphical improvements. However, the frame rate problem in the original is no longer present and the multiplayer/online is greatly improved. -This game is violent but it wouldn't be considered realistic violence (like robbing a bank, shootout with the police etc. like in Grand Theft Auto). The situations have never occurred at any time in the history of Earth. -The vast majority of enemies that your character must deal with in a violent manner are only vaguely humanoid or not humanoid at all. Without going into the the story-line they are more akin to skeletons or zombies when humanoid and simply monsters of one type or another when not humanoid. -There are no firearms. The weapons consist of swords, clubs, battle-axes, shields, etc. There are also bow and arrow, and a minimum of crossbows. The characters which the player creates from the ground up also have an option to use various magic and miracles as a means of offense, defense or support. -There is no nudity, sexual situations, romantic relationships, or foul language. -The 'blood' expelled when hitting an enemy is not realistic and simply serves as an indicator of a successful hit. It is more of a particle effect. In
