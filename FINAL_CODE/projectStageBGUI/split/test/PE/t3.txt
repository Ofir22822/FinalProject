This game isn't violent
A Great game but not for kids!
Amazing
The reviews for this game compares it to gta, this game has almost no violence. The blood is almost none, the only concern is the story being a bout the mafia. My kid was begging me to let him play it so I sat down and watched some gameplay and then decided it shouldn't be R at all. It should be M. After my sun played it he said it was really good and he enjoyed it and is waiting for the next game to come out now!
The game is set in 80s Japan during the bubble economy - which means that the backdrop is a time of sex, booze and gangsters. Which should be enough to keep kids away from the title. The story is great, it is about a young guy who is framed for murder and is trying to find his way in the world of the Yakuza, big buisness and trying to figure out what like is about. The game actually has two MCs, the other one is a Yakuza who has fallen from grace and is trying to get back into the game. Both MCs are pretty moral (as in they don't want to kill anyone and try their best to be as good as they can be). All in all one of my fave games but not one I will ever let my kids play (until they are old enough) especially with the VERY stark sexual themes (which are in a lot of mini games and impact the main story).
While this could be one of the best of the Yakuza games, it full of violence and swearing, the fights are mostly tame however the heat action moves could range from enemies having their heads pushed into wall or being crushed by bicycles. There is also one or two torture scenes, one in a flashback, mostly obscured but the second is far more graphic. The story is also mature and at times very emotional. Best left to the adults but still one of the best titles on PS4.
Japanese version of zero series is NOT for kids.
Many people don't know but the japanese versions of some zero games are very violent, if you switch your game version to japanese of a zero series not the zx, there is a lot amount of gore. The robots even splatter blood so only adults or teens will play the japanese version if they like blood and the story also has a pretty dark tone too. The english version is very fine though. It is a really good hack'n'slash game like devil may cry but it is 2d, you can eliminate enemies like a super cool assassin robot.

Dreams is a great engine to create whatever your heart desires in any way, but you can also play the things that other people make. And that’s when it gets slightly inappropriate. Here
