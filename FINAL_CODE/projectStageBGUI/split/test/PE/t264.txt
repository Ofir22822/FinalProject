Overwatch is a Hero-Based First Person shooter that is fun (if you casually play and don't pog) Community is toxic at times but game is good and fast-paced.
Appropriate game with violence that that is slightly cartoonish. I’ve been playing this game for just over 2 years and have never gotten sick of it. 100% would recommend for anyone who want a game to have fun with but also enjoy a competitive experience. As long as you’re old enough to have an understanding of how to play the game then I recommend you try it out.
It is a great game, the violence in it is quite tame due to the fact that it is cartoon characters. The only thing I have to say is there is a bit of blood. I first discovered this when I shot a character in slow motion and saw the blood fly off their head. Also there's a few characters in this game that have quite revealing outfits. such as the character called Widow Maker, you can see her butt in the battle field. and another character called Tracer doesn't leave much to the imagination. So you must have a chat with your child about this, but really you don't notice it too much, although that doesn't mean it is ok.
Play Fortnite or Minecraft... maybe even Roblox! Just don't even bother with this game, it is horrible
There is sexy outfits for some female characters and the violence is pretty futrisitic so it is apropriate for kids who like action games
Overwatch is good game, but Paladins is still better. Violence is the main factor. Animated blood appears but is sometimes hidden during the colourful battles and fast paced shootouts. Some characters wear "thicc" outfits and some revealing. The community sometimes comes up with theories and characters lore based on sexuality.
The best game I have ever played. While some characters will say d*mn when they take damage it is fine as long as your kid knows not to cuss. very cartoony violence with minimum blood. There is a character that smokes a cigar and there is beer and wine located around the map there is no bad thing to do with drugs. While some voicelines/sprays are not the best (The noose spray and reaper's voiceline, DIE DIE DIE) they are not very bad. some female characters are animated a little.... weird. Most character are nice and this is a great team building game. The Competitive mode should be played by older kids because it takes a lot of strategy and skill, the voice chat is mostly adults cussing, and people get really mad when they have a kid on
