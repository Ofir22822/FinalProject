 style of very old cartoons like Disney cartoons, the style of 1930s cartoons is near-perfect and I love the music in this game. A lot of the bosses are really great. Though, I'm surprised to find that a nine-year-old here finds the game easy. The bosses can be too much and they give me a headache. Though, don't play this on a laggy computer, it would be near impossible to play it when the game is lagging.
nothing bad but at the end theirs a level called one hell of a time but thats it
The graphics of this game is awesome and i think tweens can handle this game easy.
