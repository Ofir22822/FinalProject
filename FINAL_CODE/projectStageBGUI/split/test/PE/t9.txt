 with those caveats, it's still one of the best whole-family action games on the Switch.
I love that super Kirby clash is available on the switch. It is free to play but you can make purchases to speed up character ability progression in the game. Super cute game, clean crisp graphics, and I love you can play with 4 people!!! Definitely give it a try.
Really good game!
A Great Family Game
I hope there will be more games like fireboy and watergirl on hudgames.
We bought Torchlight 2 for everyone in our family, and we play it together sometimes on Family Game Night through our local Ethernet. (We wired all the rooms in our house with Ethernet, so we have our own network.) The game is a fun point-and-click adventure that takes up where Torchlight left off. To begin a new game, you pick your character, either a berserker, an embermage, an outlander, or an engineer. You can choose to be either gender, with a plethora of choices for hair style, hair color, and face. Then you pick and name a pet. Pets are important, because you can send your pet back to town to sell items you don't want and buy items you do want, like healing potions. You start by getting a quest to go to a nearby town. The beginning leg of the journey is rather easy, regardless of difficulty, allowing the player to learn the interface as he goes. Once in town, you get more quests and uncover more of the storyline. I have played the main quest to completion three times, as an embermage, outlander, and engineer. Torchlight 2 contains lots of side quests, a hidden quest, and a lot of entertaining options along the way. For people worried about privacy or safety, you can play the game all the way through by yourself. You do not need to log into a network. Torchlight 2 also has a local co-op option, with is how I play with my family. Again, only known people can (hopefully) access your local network. While the game is mainly played for fun, if you play with others, you learn how to work as a group. Also, figuring out which weapons or armor to use requires some math knowledge. Overall, I give Torchlight 2 a five-star rating.
get this game bro
If you've never played 8 before, buy it.
This game is AWESOME. it is not that violent and nothing bad exept for one or 2 curses that are in the game. f your kid is age 10 or up they should have lots of fun and not see or hear anything that bad.
But if you already have an older version, the improvements aren't really worth buying it again. The older Steam version can be modded to an even better state than this somewhat lazy cash grab.
Retro style dungeon crawler has smooth execution and pace. 2 player couch co-op.
Multiple retro "pixel art" games that throw back to the 16 bit era graphically are many times an ugly eye
