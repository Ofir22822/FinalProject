 into But don’t let kids under 13 see the tape messenges they reveal some dark things but other than that kids 8- will be scared by dark rooms and night terrors switch is a good version for kids but older than 12 then VR is fine
Amazing game and amazing story, but very scary. Me and my child play it. We like it but get scared. So good.
This is EXACTLY like the original so it has the same story line and everything. But the VR just adds to the horror!
SO SCARY!! its fun but too scary for under 13!
Its really fun and it's rated T for a reason guys. If your to scared to play it thats fine but your reaction isn't the same as everyone else. I see 10 year olds playing this game and having a good time.
Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted is not a game for the easily scared. Multiple times I found myself throwing off the headset because I couldn't take the tension, and this is before the homicidal animatronics came anywhere near me. I have to say, whoever made this game did an excellent job at making it absolutely terrifying. If you can make it through the game without quitting however (and that's a big 'if'), it's actually pretty good. I'd recommend it anyone who owns a VR headset and thinks they can handle the horror. No kiddies though, or you'll be dealing with nightmares for at least a week. 8/10.
This is a bad game don’t play it it will give your child nightmares. It has too many jump scares and can very much scare you. DONT PLAY IT!!!
It’s a good game overall with a lot of good scares but the backstory is gruesome and very horrific, as long as you don’t let your child learn about the back story you’ll be fine!
this is fine for kids
Amazing interpretation of the original games and added lore.
If you want it you can play it with ease
Omg SO FUN!!!! but so scary!I am a serious gamer and i think its probably for early teens so if you are younger than 8 EXTREME SCARINESS!
an 8 year old would be afraid of it trust me
Good game with good concepts feels too anemic.
Read mine
Past Sonic racing installments have had larger rosters and more unique feeling tracks. Although the game runs smoothly, the tracks don't feel different enough to make them much more than backdrop to similar turns and scenarios. The team concept and up to 4 player split screen is perfect for some couch co-op with the option of playing on the same team/ different teams or as individual rivals. THIS is unique and an interesting dynamic. Aside from the novelty though, the rest of the game seems cut short in almost every other way, With just over 20 tracks and 12 racers, it all seems tame and unexiting once you've run the courses and become accustomed to the small variety of racers. The racers themselves are divided into 3
