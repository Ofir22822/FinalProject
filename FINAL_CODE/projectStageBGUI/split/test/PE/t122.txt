 in the following: As for Agent 47, his morals are technically wrong, but you as the audience are aware of that. Do the ends justify the means? That's for you and your child to decide. It's super easy to play, the tutorial in Hawke's Bay teaches all you need to know about the game and exploring the game further is as easy as watching a video from creator MrFreeze2244. He has slowly transitioned away from Hitman as a whole, but his content is engaging, with some swears here and there. I'll talk more about the swearing later. The game features grotesque blood, but here's how to fix the blood issue: You can't exactly fix it without going in the game (for which you'd have to decompile and create some form of mod, and if you're reading this you don't have the technical knowledge to do), but you can try to limit it. Blood only appears in the game when someone is shot with a pistol so it wouldn't be too hard to try to limit their use of the gun. As for "sex", it's not sex. It's 2 levels with swimsuits in them. The swearing is a little excessive but by age 13 the entire genre of swearing is covered. Drinking is a semi-big portion of Hitman 2 but it's portrayed in every level in a minor manner and as a poison ability, drugs are only shown in certain levels as pills in cabinets, cocaine (fellow posters may take issue with the Santa Fortuna level being focused on cocaine but there is a level containing cocaine. In specifics it's the third floor of the New York building), and smoking is infrequently shown but there are cigar boxes in Isle of Sgail and Whittleton Creek, the latter being more prominent. Consumerism is a semi-big issue because there are only 2 levels locked off with the Gold and Silver expansions (which also contain suits and items that are essentially useless, you can play the base game and unlock their equivalents): New York and Haven Island. It's $20 more for those two levels but they are not important to the story. I clicked "Safety and privacy concerns" because the game has to be online 24/7 in order for DRM. Playing it offline prevents progression in levels, which prevents the ability to unlock loadouts and such. Big issue and their Privacy Policy is a little pervasive. However, speaking with IOI there are ways to opt-out. Should 18+ play it only? No. It's a violent game but it's not going to cause another mass shooting. CSM is reacting improperly. This is due to the fault of the reviewer, who didn't play the game at all and wrote this article in order to get money. This website should be 18+ because of the lies on it, and H2 is just one on their hitlist.
Rated 18+ for strong bloody violence, language and drug references.
its pretty epic
Good action
It barely has blood/gore (there’s not any gore) It should have
