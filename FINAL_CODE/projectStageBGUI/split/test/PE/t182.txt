 I’ve seen
From what I’ve seen it’s a good game but shouldn’t be used for people who are too young because certain things are inappropriate for them I feel it’s more up to the parents if their kid should use this but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone under the age of 12 but i’ve only played it a little bit so take this with a grain of salt
celebration of japanese idol culture with some flaws
The game has some aspects it nails pretty well (for example the fights themselves, which are full of colorfull effects and just overall fun gameplay especially the session mechanic is really fun), but also others (mostly the dungeons) which just feel bland and boring. Overall good, but nothing outstanding.
fun
yay fun
Not tame, but not too crazy
Most violent one of the series
Yes.
Japanese GTA is a tad bit tamer, still not for young children.
I first played this game when I was 16, Majority of the reviews I read at the time claimed violence as extreme as Mortal Kombat X, but that was not true by a longshot. There was no intense blood or gore, still even a little could be a disturbing sight for kids under the age of 12. many of the reviews I read criticized a part in the story (trying to keep this spoiler free) where a man cut off his own finger. However, this action was off camera, and you did not see his injured hand nor the actual finger. The story was great. 10/10 the best game in the series, also the best game to play first. There are some women in bikini outfits but no nudity or real sexual content, another thing that reviewers and the ESRB were going off about. Would recommend to ages 14+
You can tune down blood amount. Although attacks can still be cruelly violent. Strong language is frequent, but heard in Japanese(still seen in dialogue). Smoking and drinking is done by main characters. But story is very great, engaging.
As a teenager who played worse games before this (GTA, Saints Row, Etc.) this game is pretty tame compared to them but a hell of alot more fun and a more interesting and intense storyline, it's not some shoot-em-up GTA style game instead, this game is actually good, it has the right about of story telling as well as gameplay which is mostly beating people up, though there's side quests and optional things like Karaoke and dancing. In my opinion, even in the Yakuza setting you're still playing as a good guy, in this particular one you play as two different men who have to battle their hardships to save the ones they love.
There are no explicit sex scenes/nudity in Yakuza 0, so if that's your main concern with games like GTA 5 this is a great alternative. However, there is still strong violence, language (again, not anywhere near as much as GTA), a minigame involving flirting with bikini-clad girls, and the ability to get drunk. Good game for those who
