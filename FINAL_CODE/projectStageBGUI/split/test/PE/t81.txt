 the game, and never goes anywhere alone anymore. There is a LOT of blood in the game, but if your 10 year old is a man like my 10 year old, it is OK! There is also a ton of cus words in the game. I think that this game is a good role model because it will teach my 10 year old how to survive, because the point of this game is survival.
Language: Some Strong Sex: Mild Violence: Strong, Blood and Gore Other: Strong Horror
Great game, but only for strong stomached people. Wow, there's a lot of blood in this game. You can shoot off specific limbs/body parts with fairly detailed gore and organs. If violence was on a scale, it'd be a 9/10. There isn't much sex in the game, just one kiss and some sexually suggestive posters (women in bikinis), and an OPTIONAL note about a certain character saying he "nearly came" when he did a taxidermy on a tiger, creepy! There's lots of swearing in this game, there are multiple uses of most swear words you can think of. I chose "Positive Role Models" because Leon and Claire are, at least in my opinion, good role models. Both do their best to protect the people they love and are very selfless. Overall, this is a really good game and if you are a fan of the OG Re2, or a survival horror fan in general, this is a must play!
Even though the game was rated 15+ at first, it took a more realistic look and added more gore to the remake, Plus they've included profanity making it more adult themed. The characters on the other hand display a good message.
While this game contains literally no nudity (even partial), the game features a constant barrage of creepy imagery/sound, profanity and what is easily the most unpleasantly realistic gore I have ever seen. Now, having said that, it is a horror game exclusively for adults with some of the most heart-pounding sequences in gaming history. The zombies are scary enough, but throw in Lickers and the almost-Singing G-spawns, and you've got yourself an all-out nightmare. And that's before you throw Mr X into the mix, whom is absolutely terrifying because he plays with human survival instinct PERFECTLY; he's massive, almost unstoppable, and you can hear him stomp around looking for you, like a cross between a predator and The Terminator. Now, the original RE2 told a more wholesome version of the story here, and successfully fused horror with a somber, sad tone that this game doesn't even attempt, but on its own merits, this is genuinely as good as it gets. Just note that the violence is literally as high as it can go as it's brutal and disturbingly lifelike - I just don't mark it as, for adults, this only makes the overall package more compelling.
a bit gory at times, but not that bad. 13+ for sure
This is a very solid remake of a very scary game.
