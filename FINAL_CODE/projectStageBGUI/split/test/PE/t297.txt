 best strategy for winning. The deaths are nothing like games such as Call of Duty, the graphic violence isn't visible, just a health bar dropping. Role models are positive, because it teaches you to stand up against bullies. The storyline mainly has to do with a robot war, and you are there to keep peace with robots. Anyone would easily be fine with it. McCree, the cowboy sort of character, smokes, but not many people use him. I recommend this for 8+ if your child is mature. Trust me it is completely fine.
The fact that they gave it a 2 in sex is offensive. There is nothing like that at all. The worse that there are girls in skin tight pants but that's it. There is basically no drugs at all except someone who is smoking and that is not very apparent.
it says in the rating that it is rated t for blood,tobacco use,and violence but there is absolutely no blood.One character is smoking a cigar which is never brought up and barley noticeable. but there is violence but is not that bad like call of duty.
You would think that I'm writing this review to tell you how bad first person shooters can be and they make kids crazy. No that's not true this game is not violent or bloody
Overwatch is like any lego game. You eliminate the enemy team in order to complete the objective. The only difference with overwatch is there are more guns and more details to the guns.
Very good. Violence is quite limited, but cartoonish. Comp scene is very good, but queuing leaves some to be desired. Tons of bad team comps, but w/ friends it's fine. Very physically and ethnically diverse with characters from: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany,Russia,Sweden,US,UK,Brazil,UAE,Egypt,Mexico,and more to come. Also has a gay character.
Great game. there isn't ANY nudity or drugs. The only thing with drugs is a guy in the game that smokes a cigaret. Also the game is multiplayer, and there is a chat. If you don't want your kid hearing anything bad, simply turn off the Voice chat in settings. It is a hard game, and can sometimes be frustrating. The violence is very cartoony, so you shouldn't be worried about it. As long as your kid doesn't rage at other games and things like that, he/she should be fine with the game.
Overwatch's age rating is too high. There is mild blood but not much else. The blood id barely noticeable and I didn't realize there was blood at all until I was playing for about 5 MONTHS. Great game over all though.
I have seen many people play Overwatch, and from what I've seen, there is almost no gore and is very fun. The only thing that I could see that's wrong with it is the social interaction element. Players can chat, in a message or talk, and can play with strangers. Other then that, if your kids can play responsibly, I think it should be fine for anyone
