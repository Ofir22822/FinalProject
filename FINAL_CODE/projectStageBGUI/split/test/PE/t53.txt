 Overall, not half bad. But it is on the edge for younger players.
this game looks age apropriate for 15 and above
Naked women statues littered throughout the game.
A fun zombie game, fine for mature 11 year olds
World war Z
Great Game
Its pretty much Left 4 Dead 3. Good for 40 bucks.
This is for the parents, typically we don't see games like this a lot, which means they're usually pretty bad, for example, DOOM. But in this case, this game is not that bad. For a younger viewer, it is pretty gory, but when parents see the big, bold, 18+ sign, its scary for parents. Let's face it, I think every M-17 game I've seen on this app is 18+ when it really shouldn't be. For example, for Halo 4, that game is not bad at all, it's about shooting aliens, and yes there is some blood but not much, and look, it's 18+. This game is pretty gory, but not the worst I've seen. I think it's not that bad, it's pretty good, when it comes to co-op, female breast on manikins are shown in shopping malls, but they are not graphic at all, thank you for reading.
Extremely disappointing. The game is LITTERED with nude statues of women, all women. The mall has naked mannequins, which aren't a bit void in form, but the second area has a museum where they get more detailed and much bigger naked breasts with nipples showing. The game is rated "nothing" or "non-existent" for sex, but if you have a young child playing this, he or she will see naked women. How is that not sex related? What's worse is you don't have to go looking for them, they're thrown around like bits of trash in your travel path, so you will run into them, constantly. The developer, sadly, has made sure you'll see them. Why? The game is pretty great without this aspect. It truly wasn't needed. I did not make it beyond the second part because I'm not interested in having this thrown in my everyday life.
This is a very fun zombie shooter, which is also appropriate for mature 11 year olds. The reason why i think this is because all the violence is (normally) very fast paced and unrealistic. Though there is a HUGE amount of gore, its quite undeatailed and players will be focosing more on the, other incomming zombies. As for language, its infrequent but strong, so expect to hear the F-word every now and then. Apart from the swearing and the violence, there is nothing else that would make this game inappropriate for kids and i highly reccomend it to zombie fans.
I’ve recently purchased this game and it was not worth the money I know most people like third person video games I have nothing against you that I love assassin‘s creed Tom Clancy‘s ghost recon days gone list can go on anon but we’re here to talk about world war Z for a zombie game that Aesthetically has the
