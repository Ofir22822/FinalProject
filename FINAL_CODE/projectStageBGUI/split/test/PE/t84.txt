 Memories
Loved playing these back on the Sega Genesis and still love playing them now. The memories from these games are just great.
I love that hotel owners design
Fun solving puzzles and even provided a couple challenges for Daughter and Daddy
Charm Oozes Out of Nintendo's "Horror" series
That hotel owner is beautiful. All I can think of. She takes my breath away, every time I see her pixels on screen. Highly recommend it.
I bought this "for me" as a late Christmas gift. I play Mario Kart and Mario Party with my daughter (we'll call her Princess Peach), and Dad needs something fresh. I had seen the gameplay for Luigi's Mansion 3 and noticed you could play it with two players on story mode. I've been playing games my whole life and naturally wanted to get Peach into them. So knowing Peach's level of critical thinking, I thought she might do well to challenge herself and learn a game that didn't drive for her (i.e. mario kart drive assist). Peach will be 5 in July 2020. Peach has got a pretty good grip on most the controls. You'll be using both thumbs, the left to move Luigi around and the right to aim the Poltergust (vaccuum) or flashlight. She moves around just fine, can open doors and interact with objects. There was a learning curve that I had to walk her through, but it didn't take her long to pick up on it at all. She sometimes struggles with aiming the Poltergust and getting the ghosts (which can get tougher the further up the mansion you go). Still, we were able to beat the entire game, but there were times I had to take on Luigi so we didn't die. I tried to have her use Gooigi who can die and come back to life as many times as you want. One note on Co-Op: You will be unable to play the story on co-op until you get through a "tutorial" portion at the beginning of the game - once you get the poltergust and defeat the bellhop ghost in the garage, you'll have to get a briefcase which gives you access to Gooigi and finally a &lt;5 minute tutorial on how to use him. Then you can turn on Co-Op through the pause menu. We needed a little help from youtube on some of the bosses/puzzles where I was just missing something to solve. Some of the later bosses were actually kind of tough. But we were able to talk to one another, explore together and solve puzzles together. You're able ot buy gold bones which revive you if Luigi dies, and we were never really at any point where we were in danger of getting the game over screen once they were available for purchase (got to beat few levels first). Mom or Dad don't have to be gaming professionals, but you will be doing most of the ghost encounters on your own until the little one picks up on it (early
