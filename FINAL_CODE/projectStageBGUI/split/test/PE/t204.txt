This game gives a realistic overview of the horrors of war with a touching story. The campaign itself is the main reason I am giving it a 14+ due to the storyline of terrorist attacks and youngsters not being able to understand the reality of what is actually going on. Otherwise the multiplayer is 13+ and is just like any other first person shooter with the option to turn of gore.
I think people are crazy when they say the game is for people 18+ the campaign can be a bit brutal but other then that all of the other game modes are fine and you can turn off blood and the language so it is the right maturity of any regular 11+ person
I want to put a reliable review out here from a kid to any parents that wants to get this game for their child. This game is designed to portray modern warfare, hence the title. The campaign is extremely violent, and portrays terrorist attacks and unarmed civilians getting gunned down and blown up. There’s also a scene with a house where you can shoot unarmed people and a infant in a crib if you chose too. I’d say 14 AT LEAST for the campaign. All the kids are on here saying 10 and up are just trying to convince their parents by writing fake reviews. I would’ve done the same. But now that I’m more grown up I understand and respect my parents decisions. It’s extremely dark and violent and deserves the 18 rating. Multiplayer isn’t as bad and only has moderate bloodshed and gore. But there it’s still there. Chances are if you get your kid this game though, they’re going to want to play the campaign, and telling them to not play it’s just going to make them want to play it more. Honestly just hold off and don’t let your kid get it until they’re 14+ if I were you. But I’m not and this might not stop you, but at least you’ll have a reliable review.
I thinks that this is a spectacular game with obvious swearing (its CoD) However if common sense media is going to say that there are NO positive models in this game then I dont know of any game that has positive models in it.
Literally insane. Campaign really do be super realistic doe
Although the campaign is on “sensitive subjects” it’s no worse than the gruesome history of our historical life if not our history is a lot worse! The campaign I would rate for 14+ But multi-player 12+. If you are in middle school this is a liable game, and could even be educational.
