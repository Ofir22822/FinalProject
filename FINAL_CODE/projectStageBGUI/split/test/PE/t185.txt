 The Mega man Formula Refined And Perfected
Fun, but hard!
Megaman Zero/Zx Legacy Collection is a very great game with 6 classic games inside (for parents there is lots of blood in the japanese version so dont let your kids play it. the blood is actually just red oil but its like blood.)i have played mega man for most of my life and zero was always my favorite character. there are some death scenes like in Mega man Zx, a character named giro dies. And zero dies too (sadly) but they dont show it.Zero Is a great role model because at the final boss fight of zero 4, Zero says right before the fight "I never recalled ever calling myself a hero, and I only fight for those who i believe in." (giving zero his answer to the mega man x4 zero saying, "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FORRRR?!?!?!?) And he knows even if he has to lose his life to save others, he knows its for good reason.Many of the characters are good role models but Zero is the best one of them all.
This game might be rated "T", but in reality, the game itself is not bad. In fact, when the games originally came out, they were all rated "E" or "E 10+". There is a tiny bit of blood in the beginning of the first game, and the circuitry of robots are red (so it looks a bit like blood) but there is nothing gory. I myself hate blood, but this game was not disturbing in the least. It's pixilated, so the blood is NOT realistic. Now, as for the fear factor, there are some very slightly disturbing things for more sensitive viewers. A) The protagonist, Zero, kills all of the Mavericks in cold blood. B) Dr. Weil is downright CREEPY, and there is a slightly creepy image of him in game 4. One VERY important thing to know: The games are HARD. Originally, they were practically impossible for less experienced players. But with the addition of save-assist and casual scenario mode, the game can be much easier. I would say that it might be a little too tough for kids ten and under, but again, I don't know the skill level of any one kid. This game is truly a masterpiece, one of the best in the Mega Man series! It is so fun, and I would definitely give it a try, no matter your age! Play Casual Scenario Mode if you are having trouble beating the game. Thank's for reading!

Very child friendly
The original 3ds version was 10+ and this should be too. There’s nothing graphic or sexual. There is some minimal language such as hell, crap, and dumbass but most kids know those words anyway. You can buy wine but it’s only really for cooking. You don’t even kill the monsters; you just send them home. The messages are all
