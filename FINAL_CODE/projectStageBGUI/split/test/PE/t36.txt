 on Xbox game pass and I’d much rather play that than this. However, with Monster Hunter’s more mature themes and Dauntless’s ease of play, this might be the ticket for young tweens.
I thought I would give this game a try because a LOT of people were playing it and it was free but it isn’t fun at all. I did not enjoy a second of it. The quests on the game are just boring and stupid. I am sure there is someone out there who likes this game but it most certainly not me. — What’s in the game? Violence - Players use swords, axes, hammers, guns, and grenades to attack aggressive monsters that take a range of forms, from reptiles to giant birds. Bright red blood splashes appear with each hit. As battles wear on, monsters show wounds in their skin and lose parts of their bodies, such as their tails.
Already have a 16yo who is owned by Epic. (Not literally but nearly). Need to maintain some sanity and keep my 12yo off the role playing games for as long as possible. He won't be able to handle the addictive quality. It really depends on your kid and how skilled you all are at negotiating time, money, homework, health, eating, hygiene etc. And how much patience do you have? Does your child tantrum easily? Haha! Good luck!!
