 play this game and I have to say it is amazing I’m an 11 yr old and there is not much sexuality
Overall, this game is handled very well by my 32 year old. He understands the general purpose of the game, and it does not seem to teach him anything bad overall.
Look. I agree with a lot of common sense 18+ ratings, but this is one that just doesn't deserve it. A mature 14 year old can definately play this game! I think even a 13 year old could play too as long as they have supervision. The language is not a big deal. If you listen to middleschoolers on the playground messing around you would be more shocked at their language than the language in this game. As for the nudity, it really isn't bad at all. The nudity consists of a pair of horse testicles, and one scene where you save a women from being assaulted. The combat is what you would expect in a mature game. This would be probably the reason most parents will not let their kids get this game. The truth is if your kids play games like seige or battlefield 1 it's nothing new. The difference is your character actually has consequences for his actions and killing. Your character feels remorse if you do something bad, and you get to choose your own path. You can help people less fortunate in this game and make friends. Each decision opens a new door. It really is a great game. You get to know all your gang mates, and you get to do nice things for them and play games. For all the parents who are worried about how you rob banks in this game think about this. It is a dang Western video game! Of course you are going to be looting and causing some mischief. A positive thing to come out of playing this is you learn about how it was back then in simpler times. You learn some history, and the amazing graphics make you feel like your really in the game. Of course in combat scenarios there really is not too much gore. Unlike GTA there is no guts unrealistically flying out of people if you push them over. Just maybe a little red like all other shooter games. I encourage you parents to get your kids this for christmas. They would be missing out on a great game that teaches you that all actions have consequences. Thanks for reading.
this game had blood and and nudity in it and my 20 year old slept in my room for the next 3 months
best game of all time
This is a wonderful game, with the best and most realistic scenery I've ever seen. It is completely immersive and includes an unlimited amount of tasks from doing chores to help the camp to hunting and fishing across the giant map. It takes 15 minutes of real time to ride a horse from one end of
