 lines can be purchased and one of them is the dam* word but its in a different language so no one really feels offended if you speak English. As far as violence gets like the real world shotguns are depicted with a character called reaper but They sound unrealistic. Also occasionally in a game if you use melee like a punch blood will be shown but again very unrealistic. As the game quickly unfolds to players teamwork and cooperation seem the only way to win. Online players these days aren't very toxic anymore. I haven't been in many games where the foul- mouthed adult will say much. Mostly kids will be in the chat and if language does occur just mute them in social settings. So that way the fun goes on. I recommend this game to anyone who loves action and sci fi and playing with friends. In game purchases make your account better so just know this before any purchased come at surprising moments. One of the best games ever. Hope you enjoy!!!
should be 'e' for everyone I don't know why common sense media rates it as 14+. Plus the open mic can be disabled so people on your child's team can't hear your child and your child can't hear them when that feature is enabled.
Absolutely wonderful game that is still going strong after four years of release. The only downside to this game is the comms. As other reviews have said, they can be turned off, but because of that you will never know when to push or if anyone is flanking from behind. They are absolutely necessary if you want to succeed in this game. A good thing is that you can individually mute players so if someone isn't contributing and just spouting trash about you can mute them.
Overwatch is a great game, with great characters. I've loved the game ever since I got it, and even though I'm not very good at it, I play it for hours. It takes place in the future, so the guns aren't based off of any real guns, and you can barely see any blood, and even when you do it looks fake. The violence isn't a lot, and the characters are heroes who try to defeat evil. It's a great and fun game, and I prefer it for 8 and up.
Having invested hundreds of hours in the game, I can honestly say it is a fantastic game. There is minimal to no blood(and even then it’s sometimes blue), no sexual situations, and pretty much no swearing (aside from a Wild West characters optional voice line that includes the word ‘h-ll’). The game is only online 6v6 multiplayer, so if you don’t feel comfortable with your child playing online sadly there is no offline. You can disable game chat though so your child wouldn’t be able to talk to their team. Overwatch is a strategic, team building, cooperative game with a competitive side, and is for sure my favorite
