A good starting point
Really like this game, great for kids 8 years old.
Stunning visuals and a diverse cast give this game a nice feel to it.

Easily the best funnest game have ever played.

This game has some problems for competitive players.
Road to Halo and Battlefield.
Fun game that celebrates diversity
Great!
This is UNDOUBTEDLY a KID FRIENDLY game. While this game has FEW characters wearing MINIMAL revealing clothing and a cowboy character (McCree) smoking, this game's main message is "The World Needs More Heroes" which is extremely positive. The voice chat with strangers may seem dangerous to some, however it is easily turned off. The "sex" of this game being revealing outfits is very minor, is only character design, and can be easily disregarded. While tobacco use can be inappropriate to some the cigar is present to represent McCree's character which is a cowboy. This game also has other options than online with strangers. Players can make their own custom games in which only certain players may have access. If one wishes they could enjoy the game completely with ONLY FRIENDS and no strangers. The violence in this game is present, however is NOT AT ALL GOREY and is not what the focus of the game is. Players have set OBJECTIVES to complete for example, holding/defending an area from the opposite team until the clock runs out or transporting a car from one point to another before the clock runs out. The fact that the video and review do not mention that is an OBJECTIVE based game with violence is disappointing.
Iv'e been playing this game for two years straight now, nearly every single day. I am a tier 400 player which means I have over 300 hrs on the game. Yes, a lot, I know. But my point is that once you start playing you can never stop. It will get you addicted like a cigarette. I have tried to stop many times but eventually I just come back to it. Iv'e read other reviews saying this is a team building game. No, it really isnt. The community is extremely toxic, and you will play games where a teammate is not doing anything and throwing the game meaning your team will lose. Trust me on this, because it isn't fun. Competitive play is the only thing I really play, and it will literally drive you up the wall. This game can make you toxic, depressed and sad, and the thing is, you will keep coming back. Although the game is fun, most of the time you will be screaming at the screen. Competitive play has these things called ranks. Win a game, you go up rating. Losing, means you go down. You can go for weeks and months losing progress and feeling guilty about the fact you went down rating. There is no sense of progress in the
