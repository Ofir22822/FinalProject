 themselves. The international unit "Overwatch" was created to quell this crisis. With the crisis over and the organization disbanded, the member's work has just begun. Violence: in gameplay itself, the game lacks any blood and relies on somewhat cartoony art style, still being highly detailed. Language: Because these characters come from different countries in real life, most (minor) swears are in their native tongue, effectively letting them fly over the heads of most players. Some exceptions include the character Reaper who has a selectable voice line "see you in H---!" Sexual content: almost entirely nonexistent. Some character outfits are somewhat skintight yet not revealing. Early in the games release some players complained about a selectable victory pose for a character named Tracer, who some complained "diminished her into a mere sex symbol" due to her back parts being rather glaring. (it was later changed by the game's makers)
This is a first-person shooter in which players join an international task force trying to restore peace to the world. Players use a variety of firearms (e.g., pistols, machine guns), arrows, and futuristic weapons (e.g., laser blasters) to attack enemies in team combat objectives. Combat is frenetic with realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and explosions. Splashes of blood briefly appear with each successful hit. One character is depicted smoking a cigar.
Disclaimer: This is my opinion so don't get triggered from this disagreement. If you get mad when someone thinks different from you I highly suggest that you don't look at this comment. I've played this game for about a year so take what you will from this comment. This comment contains two main points and why I think these things. This whole comment has 746 words so yeah if you don't like reading then you might want to go away. This games Competitive system had some major issues: 1. The players: A lot of players in this game are very... questionable. I put in the game that there was a lot of swearing but not from the game characters... it's the players. With most players you run into a few problems. This game is revolved around it's competitive game mode from the way I see it and anyone that plays a lot this game knows a loss can be very annoying especially if it's because of another player or server issues. Problem A: (Most Common) is: No mics. This one happens quite a bit and for a team game like this, if you don't have communication it can make the game a very terrible experience and can give you a lot of losses. Problem B: (Very Common for me): Throwers/people who lag out. People who lag out throw the game off completely and same with throwers. But this happens to me so much at the point where I can't win because of other players screwing with the game. Also because of the next reason. Problem C: (Very Common) Incompetent Players I don't know what it is with overwatch but it sure has a
