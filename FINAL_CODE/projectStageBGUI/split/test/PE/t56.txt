 battle system that is easy to process for newcomers. The story is quite dark as the Main Protagonist's allies are killed off early in the game. Fair amount of strong language in the dialogue, such as damn, godd--n, sh--, and son of a b-tch, and plenty of insults coming from Barret. On the plus side, Cloud has a strong relationship with Tifa and Aeris, especially during the Wall Market chapter. - Spoiler Alert - Throughout the story, it's war between Avalanche and Shinra. Cloud was a former member of Soldier, but later joins Barret and crew at the beginning of the game. After the second boss fight, Cloud is separated from his friends, and later joins Aeris.

I played this game many times as a teenager and even now it is unsurpassed in terms of gameplay, characters and storyline. The story is my favorite: a Swordsman mercenary leading a ragtag group of misfits against an evil corporation. Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockhart have since become my favorite VG heroes. On a parental note, there's some violence mostly mild with sporadic appearances of blood, some sex references, Tifa and Yuffie wear midriff baring outfits, One character smokes all the time, two times a bar can be entered and you can drink at one bar, and the language is limited to D***, H***, A**, P***, GD, and S***. Fortunately, all this is counteracted with plenty of great messages about heroism, loyalty among friends, respecting the environment, the dangers of capitalism, and diversity. All the characters are of different cultures and races such as several Caucasians, one African American, two Native American equivalents, two animals (though one is actually a robot), and one Asian. Even though the graphics are dated (except for the battle and cinematics), that's the only negative to this otherwise flawless and timeless game. It doesn't get any better than this.
I think it is funny how tame people think this game is. Due to its low quality graphics, it can pass as a teen game, but there is quite a bit of content that should push it to M. There is a brothel in this game with insinuated rape and nonconsensual interactions. Although most of this game is not characterized by overtly sexual content or violence, this is still in one part and the language is quite explicit in the original PlayStation version. In the Nintendo Switch version, they may have cut down on this though. I would recommend for above 14 year olds at least. It is overall a fantastic game though! Please play at the right age.
Violence: The majority of violence is relatively mild, consisting of turn-based combat with various weapons and magic, damage is indicated by flashes of light and defeated enemies merely dissapear. A handful of environments have bloodstains, including a sequence where you follow a trail of blood (retro graphics means it doesn't look particularly realistic). Some cutscenes have more
