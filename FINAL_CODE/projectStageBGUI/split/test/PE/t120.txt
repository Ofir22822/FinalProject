 keep this in mind overall a great game 13 plus
THE GAME IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT VIOLENT! There is not sex or nudity whatsoever and gore can be turned down. I think it would be a great fit as long as your kid is mature and trustworthy
It is a pretty bad game and if your kid wants to get it should be fine but it is a complete waste of money.
Violent, gory, etc. For a mature rated game, not too bad, but definitely quite a bit for young children. Also comes with typical online game variability in voice chat content. Worst of all, the devs did not encrypt any content so personal IP adresses are at risk. It's also not a great game. You're better off buying its' predecessor, Fallout 4.
My little one had a blast playing this game! The only bad part was the scarceness of the mutated moles. They were a little bit intense, but not too much. If your child is looking for a game to play, I would get this for them, it is on sale for Black Friday. On the downside, when you get hurt, your character shows blood, which I was not expecting. Overall I loved the game!
There is a little bit of cursing but not much, the violence is definetley there, but it is nothing close to other gory and bloody games. It may be too mature for a 10 year old or so but nothing a teenager can’t handle. The game is an immersive expierence and you can play with friends. The drug reference is also very subtle. The rating on this website is a little too much for violence and drugs, there is hardly any of it.
If any fallout 4 had about 4 bad words and I have yet to hear any in the game. There is a little blood but its not that bad

The main Spyro the Dragon was delivered in 1998: by the norms of those years, Insomniac made an advancement game. The motor created by the studio permitted to attract all items two forms: with a significant level of detail and with a low one, contingent upon the separation of the article from the player. These days, such procedures are utilized all over, yet then Spyro was one of the principal games in which they executed something like this.
Language: None Sex: None Violence: Very Mild Other: Very Mild Scary Moments
I played the original of these games and loved them back then The reignited trilogy has been overhauled and looks amazing compared to the older versions. As I was playing my four year old was watching and asked to have a go She started off not being very good as she is only 4 after all but she has now gone on to complete all 3 games. Normally I wouldn’t recommend many games for 4 year olds but she managed to pick it up very easily.
It's not as bad as you think
Violence
Ok game, but deserves a lower age
