 beating this game, I have to say, it was a very enjoyable experience.
Don't bother.
I'm a long time Pokemon fan but these games, which are the first main series games on a actual home console rather than portable are NOT worth $60 at launch. Having less than half of all Pokemon to catch is just a minor issue compared to the bad graphics and glitchiness of the games. And also do NOT get the download version because it can cause you to lose your SD card data because the game is very very glitchy. The games do not look much better than the older 3DS games and the online support is basically a pay wall. You have to pay money to play the games with other people online. There are Pokemon characters who are NOT coded into the game at all. You can't bring old legendary Pokemon from other games because their data doesn't exist in the games. So if you have a shiny Latias that you caught in Pokemon Go for example, you can't bring it to the new games. The starter Pokemon are shiny locked so if you are a shiny hunter you can't reset to get them shiny. You also cannot get about 400 or so other Pokemon because they are not coded into these games. In the 3DS games you could get 807 or something like that as of Ultra Sun and Moon. In these Switch games it's just over 400. These games cost $20 more than the 3DS games yet you don't get as much content. I regret buying Sword. I listened to good reviews from the game sites like IGN and gave the games a chance. And I totally regret it. I already have the game beat even though it is supposed to be a 40 hour game I had it beat in 14 1/2 hours. The game is just bad. Edit: there are free updates and paid expansions that add more Pok?mon both new and old. The games are getting slightly better but a companion app called Pok?mon Home is needed to do transfers and adds some missing features back like GTS but it costs a chunk of change ($16 yearly subscription) to actually get any use out of it (it’s freemium with only enough free storage for 30 Mons). It’s been improved but it’s still not quite worth it. I will say it went from a 1 star to 2 and a half stars.
A Masterpiece of Modern Art
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece of modern art. It transcends the barriers of our mere mortal understanding and ascends to a new plane of reality beyond that which we puny humans are even capable of comprehending. It has touched my heart forever, and I am a deeply changed man. I give Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales a perfect score of 100/100, and graciously declare it to be winner of the 2000-3000 Millennium Award. Truly, humanity has finally reached its ultimate evolutionary
