 Good

op game pro game for getting strong op
I just want to tell you that this is a really good fit game and I highly recomend it!
Enjoyed the game, but its not the best in the series
the hack and slash game play is repetitive, but it isn't necessarily bad. I've played many RPGs, so I'm pretty used to repetitive game play. The story was really interesting, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. It wasn't the best game, but it had something about it that brought me to it. I feel like people who are 13+ could play the game, but it depends on the person. This is why I gave it 15+. The game is not the best by any means, but it has a charm to it that can be seen as enjoyable. I would say that the other No More Heroes games are better, but it is alright.
Challenging puzzler!
I rated this a 12 and older only because of the violence. Felix is a fun character and is mostly seen dancing his way through life. there are instances of decapitation. the whole thing is basically a puzzle that leads to a killing.
Very good for family game nights
I had a 3-page-long review but it deleted itself because I went to a different tab.
Amazing Game
Good party game.
We got Jackbox a few months back, and so far, it's been amazing! We have a blast playing it with our cousins, and it's made even better by the fact that we can do it and have fun even when we're 1000 miles apart. Here's some more information. SETUP AND USE: We do Jackbox through Steam on Windows 10. It was very easy to download, setup, and play. The only downside (a minor one) is that you have to have a separate host device from which you run it, but having as many computers and tablets as we do, it's not a problem. Connecting to a game is very easy to do, and as long as you have a good internet connection you shouldn't experience problems with being disconnected. THE GAMES: We ourselves have done every single game except for Trivia Murder Party 2 (just in case it isn't appropriate for the younger kids in the family), and we love them all. Each is uniquely different and will provide hours of fun. In Role Models, there may be a few subjects that younger ones won't understand, but all the games we do have a family-friendly setting so we can play worry-free. Overall, Jackbox is a very good platform for family game nights, getting together with friends, and having a great time. I recommend.
So yeah, I had the best review ever, but when I tried to post my review, it deleted. Just buy it already.
It is a great party game and it is really fun to play. In every pack there are 5 games. 4 of them have family friendly mode and the other one usually doesn’t.
