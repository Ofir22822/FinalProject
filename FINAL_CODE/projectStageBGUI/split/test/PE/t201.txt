 on! just put kids mode on! Really there is nothing truly bad about this they just put popular songs so you can just dance to your favorite songs! I love it honestly and if you don't want to buy and buy and buy just put just dance videos on youtube and dance for free!
For kids you can have kids mode so it just has kids songs!
Okay, I'd like to point out that the parents are overreacting. I saw some of their reviews, and I think it is partially their fault for not setting boundaries for the songs. Sure, some songs have inappropriate content, sure, it has some moves that parents might not enjoy seeing, but it's their fault for not setting boundaries. And if the kids are 6 or under, they can enjoy kids mode, with totally appropriate content! The curse words are bleeped out, and overall it's a fun experience of exercise and fun all bundled into one! I love this game!
He loves it! We play it as a family a lot and in the UK its rated PEGI 3 so honestly, its not inappropriate. All bad parts are blanked out and these songs are heard on the radio on a daily basis. The naughty parts go over my bros head. If you are mega protective, just play on Kids mode (it has no inappropriate content whatsoever).
This game is amazing and everyone should be able to play it nothing bad shown just dancing!!
AMAZING!!! You can do fun dances and on the website u can reccomend a song to them so that hopefully they add it on the next game! This is one of the best just dance games yet! DEFINITELY recommend this game! Also, it has Billie eilish's bad guy which is an amazing song so u can jam out to that!
My favorite game I love it I have it on my switch and on my Xbox One and not one problem get busy is hard it get I understand but don’t let one song get in the way. I especially love how it blocks out bad words
My grandpa got my family Just Dance 202 for Christmas. It is a excellent game to move your body in a fun way. I just want to play more and more. It is a perfect game for the family. I would recommend this game to family’s.
Good fun excersise
Cool!
This is a good fun exercise game with excellent dances.
Wow for first time I bought JD2019 And I Was Like Don't Stop
I know that the lyrics are a little bit mature but it is great for kids
Just got the game for Christmas and it's the best Just Dance there is! Great songs, so modern and really easy! They have great new features too. So good! Rude lyrics are bleeped out. No "suggestive" dance moves either if you're fussy.
Incredible! I love it!
Fun, but hard!
It's good spooky fun
Very good puzzle game that keeps you going
Luigi's Mansion 3 is a fun, clever, and family friendly game.
