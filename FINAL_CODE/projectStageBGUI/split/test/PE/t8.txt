 damage and run out of "stamina", your character falls down, yells "Help!", and someone can come over and press a button to pick them back up with some health. It's extremely forgiving, the only way to "lose" is to run out of time, or if everyone gets knocked out at once. I played with my 6, 7, and 8 year old (two boys, one girl), all pretty new to video games, and they all loved it. There are 4 different "roles" to play, and it was neat to see them choose the role they like best. You also have very simple upgrades to weapons and armor, which update very simple stats. It is an extremely chill but engaging game, especially for adults to play with kids. Now, let's circle back to the freemium model. The "premium currency" is "gem apples", you spend them for various kinds of progression. However, putting money into the game gives you a PERMANENT increase to the amount of gem apples you get every 12 hours. The cheapest is less than a dollar, to buy 50 gem apples, and which will forever give you 20 gem apples every 12 hours instead of 10. You can also spend gem apples, fairly cheaply, for other kinds of benefits that permanently improve playtime or progression. That's why I call this "pseudo-freemium", because it's almost like you're paying for the number of boss battles you can reasonable expect to unlock and win against. Because most of the "game" isn't progression through some story, but choosing a boss fight, choosing an interesting combination of roles, trying to beat your record time, or trying to get all the achievements for a particular boss. And all in a way that's still extremely accessible for young kids. Using gem apples to refresh your playtime is extremely cheap, compared to how many you get every 12 hours, so there's very little lost when losing a particular battle. Personally, I tried out the game, looked at the options, and chose the one that was about $4. That gives me 30 gem apples per 12 hours (tripling the original rate), and I've never needed to put in more money. I've already unlocked enough interesting boss battles to last our family for quite a while. And I just think it's great to see examples of "freemium" moving away from merely predatory, to more of a "pay for what you want" model, where you can choose between the "budget price" and the "full price" depending on how seriously you want to take the game. That all being said, I only give it four stars, because some of the information I have put here is NOT very clear or obvious in the game. I feel like the game needed a better tutorial or consolidated reference page. The game works best when there's an adult to "facilitate" things, especially getting those permanent benefits early. Also, yeah, if kids play unsupervised you need to put your credit card behind a password. But
