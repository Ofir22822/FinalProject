 other is a soilder. That’s probably why they are realistic. Most of the characters are scientists who created weapons life Moira who can shoot beams that heal friendly players, or Zenyatta a philosophical robot that can shoot magic orbs that can help friendly players or worsen enemy players. If your kid asks for this she/he is probably old enough to play it. This is one of the best team based games of all time.
A simple shooter game. Very little blood. While sure, the characters may be revealing, kids wont understand it unless they are old enough. There is voice chat, which is almost required to play competive, but it can be turned off, and I would not reccomend having it on unless your child is 12+. A very simple shooter game for most ages!
This game is clean with some violence it is just fun good for families and I can’t count maccre smoke taboco becouse he is a cowboy

i find it fun to play but i cant help but notice i suck. with the mic you can hear alot of swearing. reaper is op though.
Game is great. Fun, interesting. The game has a very low skill floor, and a very high skill ceiling. Many interesting, fun, unique characters to play as. There’s a character with a kit for any play style you can think of. The game is heavily based around a group of heroes, a group of villains, and a couple more neutral groups and characters, but the story revolves mainly around the ideals of heroes. Game has some balancing issues but that’s the only real issue gameplay wise. Biggest problem for younger audiences are the voice coms. The game is very dependant on teamwork and speaking with teamates, but that means you'll lose a whole lot if you’re playing competitive matches if you’re not in chat. This means that you’ll want to be in voice coms, but that also means that you’ll most definitely run into toxic players. Not knowing how to handle these players or being too young could make the game less fun to play, Not much actual swearing in the game, but toxic players certainly bring that to the table. There’s obviously violence because it is a first-person class-based shooter. There’s a few revealing outfits in the game.
I think the game is good... But I don't love it. I think that there is a lot of joy for a lot of people, but it isn't quite for me. But u think it's fine for most kids. It teaches kids teamwork, and doesn't have any gore, just the guns. I think anyone above 8 is allowed to play it, but they probably
