 and they say the game is great and I haven't seen a drop of blood or even a bad word so I think everybody should get it and its the perfect gift for any teen.
When you are downed and a Brit, You yell," Help, im f*cking hurtin." Also if you shoot someone in the head, a large mass of blood emerges. Great fun though, gunplay is one of the best. Some microtransactions, but only for cosmetics/
Has great messages that support gender equality and acceptance of all religions, races, and cultures. Many of my students learned lots about how people from different backgrounds live. I love this teaching device and am so glad a tool like this has come to the public to make learning so much better and accessible to all.
I think its ok for teens and up. Not tweens and kids though.
All around this game is great. the most swearing comes around when you're playing as a brit. Blood/Gore: If your child has seen movies such as Saving Private Ryan or 1917, the gore is a lot less than those movies. the most gory part are when enemies are being stabbed. swearing includes 2-3 f-words per game (depends if you're playing as a brit or not.) 4-5 s**t per game. thanks for reading my review and if you get the game, have as much fun is i have had! :)
I am a professional PEGI reviewer. ( I gave this PEGI 16)This game is a must-have for teens. The violence is slightly overstated in the review. There is a very evident bloody spray when enemies are shot. There is a long-lasting blood mist when enemies are sniped. There is brief gore when enemies are shot. The game only shows evident gore when enemies are stabbed. The violence in my opinion is 8.5/10. Games which have this level of violence are Sekiro(8.7/10), the ghost of Tsushima(8.4/10), AC Unity(9/10). There is a great deal of language, f**k, sh*t, hell, damn, bastard, m*therf*cker, c*nt, ass, are all used commonly. The language is 9.6/10.(Worth noting that HARSH language is only used by brits.) A few games which has this much language is GTA V(10/10), and Gears 5(9.8/10), and not much more. It is worth noting that language is only harsh when playing as a brit.(There is one 10 min war story without around 20 f words!) Language is present when playing as an American and German but the language is not as harsh(s words and b words) and they speak their native tongue. I think that the chaos of the multiplayer and the emotional power of the last tiger war story overshadow some of this mature content. This makes the game perfect for teens, thank you!
As a mother of 2 one being 11 while the other just 3 I think this fun historically based game is suitable for my 11 year old son as the only vilonce is a small bit of blood and not heads being blown off the language used is nothing
