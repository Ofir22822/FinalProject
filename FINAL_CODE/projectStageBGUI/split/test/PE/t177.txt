 enough to be 18+ there is options for blood and profanity to be turned off and should be fine for a 10 year old however, my recommendation would be for 13+ because at this age children should be more than mature enough to play games such as COD Battlefield ect.
Ive seen my 10 year old kid play it and its generally not that bad, theres some blood here and there and some dismemberment with some of the 50 cal weapons but its just another shooter game its not bad at all, although there is a bit much swearing in the campaign but its nothing a 10 year old cant handle.
GOOD GAME HARD TO PLAY UNTIL USED TO GAME THE OLY BAD POINT IS THAT ONLINE PLAYERS DO GET ANNOYING ON THE MIC. ALSO THERE IS TOO MUCH VIOLANCE FOR MY SON WHO IS 14 TO PLAY THIS. AGES 16+
the multiplayer can be disturbing for kids under 15 but i have watched my son play modern warfare and the game has a feature where you can turn off blood and swearing. To be honest the swearing is not as bad as some of the things they would be hearing in school anyway. The 18 plus tag is simply a guideline for the campaign and doesn't really reflect the true nature of the game. I have been buying my son the annual call of duty for 2 years now and he is a good lad and loves playing with his friends. I used to think this game was as bad as the ones i used to play (black ops 1, world at war) so i wouldn't usually let him play but as I saw some of the gameplay I realized it wasn't really that bad If your child has the maturity to tell the difference between a game and real life i think that he/she would enjoy playing this game
