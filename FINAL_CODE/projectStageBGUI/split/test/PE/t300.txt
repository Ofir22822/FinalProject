Ok, so... this game is actually more 10 and up. 1st, McCree is smoking a cigar, not a joint. a tip in the chat problem, if you are playing ps4 or xbox one, hop into a party. at least i think. on ps4, prioritise party chat audio. on xbox, idk I'm a ps4 gamer.
This game is definitely good for kids!!! My dad is very cautious about the video games that I play, but still decided to purchase the game for me. I got it when I was 12 years old, and I'm now 13. He has watched me play before and thinks it's great. I will admit it VERY OCCASIONALLY uses the word damnit when a character is upset, but it doesn't matter because a lot of parents don't understand that kids here worst stuff at school all of the time. It has a great message that the world could always use more heroes and you should show your kids some animated short which bring a great message. The character Mccree smokes a cigar but that is just because he is a classic western cowboy. Violence is fine for kids if all ages. In fact, my cousins, (4 and 6) have played the game before. It is a colorful kid friendly game and is the only game I've played in months!!! FAVORITE GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be aware some female characters may show some boob and butt.
It is not a bad game there is blood BUT as hard as I try to see it, it's still really hard to notice. I would say this game is one of the best games ever and it is VERY beginner friendly so if you are thinking of getting a first person shooter I would highly recommend this. The consumerism is up for this one because there is a lot of clothes and such you can get but everything there is worth buying 100 times because it is such high quality. The worst thing probably in this game is one character (McCree) has a cigarette but it is VERY hard to notice during gamepley and you only really notice it during close ups which happen for at max 5 seconds at a time but if you are going to stop your daughter/son over this statement think again because so many people in the world smoke so your daughter/son will probably just see it in-game then not care because they know smoking is bad.
Overwatch is a 6v6 first person shooter(FPS.) As most FPSs are they can be violent. But overwatch isn't. The game has 23 characters. There is one character that
