Great game but inappropriate for young children
Alright for a child entering middle school.
Let me talk
Surprisingly Acceptable
Graphic sex scenes.
Petty of commonsense
Way more tame than Call of Duty and other M games.
This game is not as mature as you think
Ram Ranch Really Rocks
Maybe a little bloody but nothing you haven't seen on TV.

There's nothing "mature" or "adult" about this game. I tried to give it a try on account of my wife who got it for me as a gift. I knew it had a tendency to cuss, but thought I could change the language to Spanish or maybe skip those scenes, but not even close. Right from the start they lay it on heavy. Every word you can think of. I'm not playing the hypocrite...putting my kids to bed so I can stare at this game. The 5 minutes I did play were boring anyway.
Has many positive role models and shows kids how to be responsible. No blood or anything of the sort and any responsible 6 year old can handle this game. Hope your child has a fun time with this one.
This game is not bad whatsoever. Other people may say it but this is not true. Nudity is essentially 0 unless you happen to walk in this room during one part where all you see is a women's bare back. Horse genitalia is in it but that doesn't matter. Violence isnt bad whatsoever, not much blood or wound marks, plus your child chooses whether or not they want to cause violence and I dont see why they would. No violence equals in game bonuses. Even the game supports not having any violence. Swearing is more minimal than you might expect with mostly just g*dda**it and sh*t. I've played this game quite a bit and heard 1-2 f bombs throughout the whole thing. The game gives you the option to be good or bad and it is much more productive to be good so the M rating is basically just there for what you can do. In most cases, there is no violence at all. There is drinking and tobacco use. It's the wild west, it has to be historically accurate which this game very much is. If you have a 10 year old+ son and dont let him see drinking he wont adapt very well as an adult.
Time and time again, my son has pressured me to get games that I feel are unfit for him; he constantly asks for games that have way too much blood and gore, but after playing the game, I see that it I completely appropriate, the violence is toned down beyond recognition, alcohol is only used by "the bad guys." Overall I think that the opinions highly underestimate the maturity of young teens, or even tweens.
