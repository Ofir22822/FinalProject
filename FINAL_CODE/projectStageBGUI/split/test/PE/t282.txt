 years. Plus, all the guns and stuff are Lazers and sci fi stuff. Except McCree (McCree has an old pistol) Some iffy stuff, there is a character named widow-maker, reaper and when reaper is using his special he yells out: DIE DIE DIE! If you ask me the least violent character is Winston. You need to understand overwatch is an online game with open chat. If you don’t think your kids are ready for that it is up to you. Other than that, I think that overwatch is the road to M games. So the more they play games like overwatch, Star Wars Battlefront and Fortnite, the more they will want to play those games. So beware for asking, can I have titanfall?
Overwatch is very friendly as far as shooters go, there is very little blood and almost no obscene language or drugs (apart from McCree’s cigar) This game is especially important for consumers because it celebrates individuality and diversity with a cast of characters from all different races, countries and backgrounds, as well as a fairly large number of amputees, a canonically gay character and a canonically autistic character, all shown as strong, admirable role models. All in all, Overwatch is a fantastic game for both enjoyable gameplay and vast inclusion. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.
So awesome! Some violence used and some open chat but it's great! IK McCree smokes a cigar but he's a positive character.
