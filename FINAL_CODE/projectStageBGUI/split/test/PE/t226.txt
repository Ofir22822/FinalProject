 is fairly dark and gritty, as it tries to show some of the horrors of war, and how war is awful. I think that this is something people should see. The campaign is violent and sometimes gives you the opportunity to kill innocent people, although you are usually punished for this. The campaign shows torture and sometimes people being burned alive. However, the game uses the Russians as the main antagonists, like in the original games (I think). But in this game, it shows the Russians doing things that the US has actually done (war crimes). And it makes them look like heartless monsters. At one point, it is stated that the Russians attacked a village on the "Highway of Death." This is something that the US did in the Persian Gulf War. So after you play it, don't assume that the Russians are evil. They're not innocent, but neither is the US. Multiplayer is good, but some guns are just kind of OP, like the M4A1, and some shotgun that I don't know the name of. A lot of people don't like some of the map design, and there's a lot of camping. I don't really have much of a problem with campers, but I totally get why people would. I, for one, do enjoy the multiplayer, and I assume that most players do, for the most part, enjoy it. Campaign is ok for a mature tween or teen, and pretty much anyone who doesn't mind blood, violence, and a bit of swearing can play multiplayer.
Great game fantastic graphics. Would rate 15+ due to the swearing and blood however kids at 13+ are probably used to it.
Modern Warfare
This game is lit
The Campaign is realistic, but the multiplier is fine.
13/15+

Parental review
I like it.
Good Game, But still in progress
I LOVE this game, so much I bought it on my PC, and somehow convinced my Dad to get the game! It's a cross-play game, so you can play it on multiple platforms! My Dad, Brother (10yrs) and myself (14yrs) play this game a lot! It really brought us together! The game itself is amazing, however... the campaign is NOT for children. I found it disturbing. The multiplayer and CO-OP is ok, just turn off the blood and gore! I'd really recommend this game, to anyone... unless we are talking campaign. 12+ at least. Oh, and one of the main characters smokes a cigar once or twice.
I LOVE THIS GAME. I don’t get why people are saying it’s bad though my little brother who is 8 plays it and he hasn’t changed a bit it’s actually made him more social (playing with his class which he wouldn’t usually do) Also it has increased the happiness he has overall he and I have a great time on it.
The campaign does deal with a-lot of strong war subjects, the multiplier is fun, but camping is a issue. But overall a brilliant game, the campaign
