 This is a fun , puzzle game for ages 10 and up.
Good game
My daughter enjoys this game. It’s pretty cool. There is some violence but no gore or blood, only ink. It’s easy to play, and sex and language aren’t present at all.
it may be scary for young ones, but theres really nothing mature in this game
this game seemed iffy at first but this game is awesome for 12 year olds. honestly, if your kid is 7 and wants this game don't buy it. but its a really fun game and my kid loved it. it may have some iffy ideas abpout souls and scary characters but its harmless. I mean no sex or language at all. It is a really good game and if you are wondering if you want to buy this for your kid, just ask yourself, is your kid fine with scary things? Does he or she play horror games like five nights at freddys for instance. If they have, they would definitely be able to play this and would not be scared. it is a laid back game and is not bad at all. I rate this 5 stars
This game I was contemplating getting this game for my 12 year old and I decided to buy the game and if I did not like it, I would send it back. I bought it and watched him play it. I was at first wondering about the factor of possession and soul stealing. although there may be some iffy ideas here, this game is overall harmless. I watched him play the game and beat it three times in all. over all this game has awesome graphics, no themes of sex or language at all. no bad morals or themes whatsoever. Awesome game. Even I started playing. I rate this game 5 stars.
I think that unless your religious or anything, this game won’t harm your children. There are pentagrams and such shown in the game, yes, but not shown in a way that your children should replicate that. Also, while there is a bit of violence in the game, none of it is very graphic and there is no blood and gore, only ink. And the game is not very scary at all, it’s more of a puzzle game than anything. I definitely feel that your children will be perfectly fine playing this game.
No sex, profanity, blood or gore. Old timey cartoon demons, creepy ink monsters that chase you and a mystery to solve. Lost souls, Chucky still devil worship implied and some killing of monsters. It's awesome. I've watched my son play and beat this game three times. Pentagrams, evil illustrators toutured souls, ink monsters and jump scares activate.
yes it may ave the projectionist's head ripped off and Sammy Lawrence gets killed by an ax I don't see anything wrong with it. there is no blood at all just ink. there are pentagrams around the studio but other than that I would give it 1,000,000,000 thumbs up!
