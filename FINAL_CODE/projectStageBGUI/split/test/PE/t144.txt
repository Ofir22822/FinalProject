It’s really fun I have seen my son play it and I’ve played it myself, it’s great for kids 8+ Other parents are to over protective.
It has some of everything. For people that are coming for questions about rape/sexuality in the game, there is none. I've played through it, it's not bad. There are two scenes in question here. One where a woman asks to bathe you. Even if you accept this offer, nothing is shown. Very clean there. The second; If you make your way to a swamp area, you may encounter another man who hits you. You wake up in his bed tied up, nothing shown there either. Not too clean, but fine if your child understands. Next, swearing. Mild swearing. I feel reviews are exaggerated on this topic. If your child knows the words, they'll be fine. Mostly words like b**ch, or ba**ard. It has an amazing storyline. You can play for hours and never get bored. Graphics are amazing. If your child may understand some of those topics, the game might be perfect for you.
Hi, other parents, I bought this game for my son and had my husband play it first to see what he thought. He thoroughly enjoyed it and said my son could play it. It has some bad words but all tweens know these words by know and it has small snippets of sex talk but the main character does bad things everyone in the west did but he sticks up for what he believes in and it has made my son more confident and a stronger young man.
I absolutely loved this game and think it would be fine for your 10 year old to play!
