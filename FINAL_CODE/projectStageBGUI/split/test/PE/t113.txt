 kid is mature enough not to repeat foul language, inappropriate names, cartoonish blood, ect.
The game is fun and finally something different from Roblox.. But the chat opens doors for anything. *my daughter's experience: she is 11 and someone put their phone number in the chat. Being 11... She texted the person back and forth for a few days. Once I saw the texts I put an end to it, but had I not been on top of her it could have been bad. Hopefully it was just another kid, but there is no way of knowing.
Here are the explanation for each factor in the game. __VIOLENCE:__ The attacks are very quick and brief, showing only a small red blood indication, though the team you're on indicates the attack animation. __LANGUAGE:__ The chat filter is automatically on and blocks all profanity. The only way to see inappropriate language is to manually turn the setting off. Misc: Among us has no points or earnings for success through violent acts like other games, so it is very unlikely to influence the child into violent activities. If you don't want your kid to become a master at lying and deception, or if they already have a problem with this, Don't Let Them Play.
Very family friendly game and just as violent as Star Wars
the game is really good but there is too much violence
I personally got this game because my younger teen brother downloaded it. After several games, I was immediately horrified at what my brother downloaded! There was strong language usage, vulgar references, and just overall awful stuff going down in the chat. This was in multiple games! I had one clean game out of 10 total games! The game itself is not bad. The chat feature on the other hand is not for children or teens unless very very closely monitored. Also contained lots of blood and violence.
There is a open chat otherwise there is nothing wrong there is just a bunch of cartoony characters
I definitely recommend!!! You and your kid will enjoy this game!

Beware of the chat
Hi I have a 12 year old daughter and a lot of people in her class were talking about this game, so she asked me about it, I researched it and some reviews said too violent but it’s cartoonish and fun, if you’ve let your kid watch Star Wars and they weren’t scared or anything this game is totally fine! The little astronaut guys are adorable and it’s a fun mystery game to play! And there’s a censored chat option! Perfect! And you’ll make you’re child very happy because if you remember being a kid it feels so fun to be included in a fun game that everyone else has, and if the game is appropriate then you should get it! Overall Among us is an amazing game!
I think it’s okay, it is a bit violent but no guns and no blood. The fun cartoons are cute and I think this is suitable for 9
