 Great game to play even with younger kids
Brilliant !
Wish they wouldn’t have the ghost figures...
Terrific for Co-op Play with Parent
So far my favorite to play with my 3 year old. It's a unique puzzle platformer that requires you to work together, but it also has a helping mechanic where you can just pull up the other player up by tightening the yarn and having the other player pull himself up. Without that, it wouldn't be accessible until much later age. It didn't take long to get a hang of things and eventually we were able to tackle the harder puzzles. Your mileage may vary especially not knowing your toddler's experience with platformer genre/mechanics.
Great gameplay and graphics. I love the cooperation aspect of the game as it encourages teamwork. There are some scenes in the background with ghost like figures where kids are scared and running from bad guys. My 7yr old thinks they are zombies and says it’s a little scary. He’s also fine with Lord of the Rings movies so there is a certain creepy ness factor which is why I gave it an 8yr rating. I also wish that the yarn characters didn’t have “horns”. Again, the game play and graphics are awesome! Lastly, some scenes are calm and the next you might be chased by a large bird or fire amber so that could impact some children.
This game is terrific to play with your child! Frankly, the best I've seen so far! Whether its appropriate for you child depends on their gamer ability. My 6 3/4 year old boy has played video games for years. Mostly on the iPad but he is adept at Minecraft on the Xbox 360. In the past we had had failed attempts at the various Lego games. Though he mastered Lego Dimensions. I thought this side-scroller may be challenging for him but he took to it like a fish to water. We BOTH loved it. There are 7 primary levels in the game and the first 3 or 4 are pretty easy. After that the puzzles got quite challenging. But, he stuck with it. The game also allows my child's character to climb on my back and I take over for the two of us. This was useful in some of the challenging parts. But, surprisingly, I climbed on his back a few times for areas I found difficult and he was better at. One other thing I liked is that this game 'forces' the two of you to play together. Whenever we played video games in the past I always felt like the 'wing-man'. The support team. My son only ever cared about his achievements and what he did. This is the first time we really played together because it was important. He couldn't advance if I didn't and vice versa. So it forced him to work WITH me for the first time ever in a video game. As others have said, there is a 'background' story playing out in the
