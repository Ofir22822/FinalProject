 their team. Great game overall. PS I put to much drugs and too much violence because there was no milder option
There is some blood that is quite unnoticable from some characters, it appears as a small splash of red. One character is also seen with a cigarette in his mouth and one character is wearing some clothing that may be considered revealing. Nothing too graphic great shooter for younger kids who want to start playing FPS games. There is an option to spend money in-game on crates and it can be quite rewarding sometimes.
How is this 13 up! First of all there is a little bit of violence but nothing compared to the Halo games. You buy it first and you have it forever until your console breaks down and no swearing at all (Apart from trash talkers but you can mute people so that is not a problem) No sex, No drugs apart from a Cowboy with a tobacco but that is nothing compared to the GTA games drugs,sex,swearing and themes. I reckon just Blizzard are just good and the game is nothing bad.
Overwatch is a shooting game. Know that now. It costs maybe 40 dollars, (Origins?), but it has in-game purchases (loot-boxes, mostly.) which unlock cosmetics like skins for characters. Pay to play. Chat, both voice and text is largely unmonitored. General chat is an open zone, a lot of (for some reason alt-right vocabulary?) and slurs. Voice chat has the opportunity to be tame, but once you go towards Competitive levels of play (level 35ish and up) Voice can be hostile. Wouldn't rec for younger children. Best bet is 14-15+. No blood. Minor references to smoking. Promotes team play. If you have a particularly immature child, disable purchases / voice chat. Very fun.
i think at first you should limit your kid if they start going overboard but video games are a place for getting away from you duties and oblagations a place to relax
It is a really good game, YOU CAN LOCK VOICE COMMUNICATION WITH PARENT CONTROLS, so you kids don’t listen to 25 year olds who don’t have a job, there is no nutity or drugs or anything bad, honistly, it’s like a Disney game with guns that 1/2 the time don’t exist and positive role models, and sayings that your child can listen to THERE IS NO CUSSING AT ALL!!! I think parents think that there is blood but there is not and you are killing BOTS NOT REAL PEOPLE COMMON SENSE MEDIA IS OVER RATING IT!
It's very cartoony and there isn't much blood or gore. It's a really fun game with lots of modes. You can learn a lot about teamwork as well as life lessons from the characters in the official short films.
TURN OF CHAT OPTIONS FOR TEN AND UNDER NOT SUITABLE INTHAY CASE but other than that it’s pretty good for people.
