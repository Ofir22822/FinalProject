 Lego movie
Nice funny I bit of action
Worth a purchase, just not right now.
Amazing and educational
Meh
Huge Letdown.
Unparalleled freedom of movement, solid combat and a whole lot of technical issues.I moderate a group of 90 players for this game, but cannot defend it's glaring issues or recommend it without at least SOME hesitation. This is perhaps the glitchiest triple A major release title I have ever played. As they release patches and fixes while trickling out new content but delaying much of it, you'll find that any amount of research will tell you that this game was not ready for it's launch...and even the studio that made it will tell you that. While you will have good fun and see all the great movement and combat it has to offer, you may find yourself crossing your fingers a little too often hoping the next loading screen doesn't freeze up somehow or boot you from your existing game session. There IS quite a variety of enemies from the get go and each is unique, so the combat and flight will keep you hooked for a time. However, in Anthems current state, if you want to avoid some potential frustration, you may want to sit this one out till it's actually been properly graduated past it's Beta stage into a fully functioning major release. And as a persistent player of the game, it's actually hard to say that.
This game has a bit of minor Sci fi violence but any mature child of around 12 and over can understand that it is all in a game. This game also has very good educational values and supports hard work. I think any loving parent should pick this up for their 12 year old or older child and do them a favour.
Its okay.
While the graphics are undeniably incredible and the flying spectacular, the bad ultimately outweighs the good here. Its all unfortunately drowned with constant load screens (Seriously! For almost Everything!! even something as simple as SWITCHING WEAPONS) which is unlikely to ever be fully fixed due to the very code structure of the world. Then there is bad servers, even worse matchmaking (massive problems in an always-online game), mind-numbing/monotonous quests, empty open world, shallow, spammy, over-flashy combat, bad AI, unsatisfying loot, an uninspired/ immersion breaking story, and a joke of an endgame. Honestly, im being generous with 2 stars because beneath all these rookie mistakes is a game that theoretically was made for me. I dont care what they add in the future give me a great game NOW! You had 6 years Bioware! Sadly after this you may have even less than that that.
It’s not as bad as you would think
it's really good
This game is for ages 10 and up, its fun but pretty violently made. I still stand by 10 years of age
fun, action packed shooter. I think its for kids 12 and up
No where near as gory and dark as far cry 5
Commonsense has no commonsense
PERFECT FOR 13 AND OLDER
common sense media overexagerates
Once
