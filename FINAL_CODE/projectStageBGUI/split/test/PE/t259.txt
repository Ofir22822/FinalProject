 every once in a while someone will pick up their mic and start to talk. 90% of the time those people won’t say anything mean, bad or toxic, but sometimes, someone will be mean, swear or be toxic. The players can be mean because they died, someone wasn’t being helpful, someone wasn’t good at their character the we’re playing or there team lost. Sometimes these players might leave the game in rage, people refer to people who do this as Rage Quitters. This does make sense because overwatch can be very infuriating but why leave and leave your team at a disadvantage? If too many players leave the match, the match will be cancelled and all the remaining players will be kicked out so why do it?
I play on a daily basis and have over 200 hours in game. There is about as much violence as a lego game, you shoot someone and when they die they fall down and disappear just like playing lego star wars. There is an occasional D*mn when a negative affect is placed on you but it is often in a another language. The game itself promotes team work because if you do not work as a team you cannot push a payload or control a point. It a very high quality game especially for the price compared to games like fortnite which will likely cost you a lot more in the long run overwatch is a one time purchase. If you want to know about sexual content there is a character with some cleavage shown but the game is in first person so if you do play widowmaker you cannot see anything and if equip a new skin you cannot see anything. Tracer also has a skin tight suit but you see more sexual outfits on the street. Overwatch is a game you can work together with your family and friends it is a great bonding opportunity and a very light T and way closer to a E 10+.
Honestly besides fortnite this is the most kidfreindly fps i have ever played there is no blood no swearing by the characters the worst things characters do is kill each other (but thats the point of the game duh) and one character smokes a cigar. If i had a kid i would defenetly let them play this game
Of corse it is a fighting game, but it has as much violence as Fortnite (RIP). One character is smoking a cigar in the name of drugs. Their is no Sex, I have no idea why that is in the rating. But it requires Nintendo online if your playing on Switch.
I've been playing this game for 2 years and I have not seen anything that makes this game too inappropriate. Some characters ex.( Widowmaker, Mercy, symmetra) wear revealing and tight suits but no actual nudity is meant in any sexual way. Language never goes far beyond the only word dam* and if you would like to be aware voice
