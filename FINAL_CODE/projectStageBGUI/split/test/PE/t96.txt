 a mercenary group known for violence and brutality. there is little to no blood. the only blood you see is when you hit the ground or little spurts come out when you shoot the enemies. this is not grand theft auto 5 violence that can be seen with civilians. in this game theres no blood when you shoot them they simply fall to the ground and after awhile disappear. This game really should be rated T for teen
Not very violent and a little confusing.
Very good game!
The best Persona game to start with
If you have never played a Persona game and you are above maybe 12 then play Persona 5, but if you are younger than that play this.It is so good and the song are AMAZING, but if you don't like rhythm games don't play even if if you like Persona.
It’s a great game
It’s good
This game is not that bad of a game the violence is animated And doesn’t look realistic and also your fighting demons not humans so you have that going for you
It’s really fun and not to violent even if the name suggests it so 11 up should be fine playing this game
Appropriate for kids who known about WW2
It has a ton of gore and language but not that bad!
Great Game
Violence and blood, great gameplay
Great Educational Game That Should Be In All Classrooms
It has some violence but not something a 13 year old haven't played yet
Fun and exiting game!
Scampers away from the original charm of the series but is very fun.
Fun game with mild vilonce and language with historcly true dates, weapons and vehicles
Fun, historically inaccurate, kids can handle the violence
Perfect for ages 13 and up
good game
NOT BAD GOOD FOR PRETEENS
Great game!
Safe Violent Video game. But sacrifices preservation of actual history
Very good
Please read this review
Disrespects ww2 vets
Shocked by the language
There is not much blood in the game, if someone gets shot, stabbed or blown up the just go limp with a small squirt of blood. There isint to much language, nothing that a mature 10+ year old couldn't handle. The game is also very good so your child should like it. My 12 year old daughter asked for it so I checked it out and I think before you let your kids play this game you should watch something like band of brothers or saving private ryan with them and if you they can handle that then they are pretty much good to go, just make sure they also know a good amount about WW2 and then I think you It is fine for them. Also sorry if my English isn't that good it is my second language.
If you have played things like call of duty world war 2 then you can start playing this game and i mean like... why not? A 12 year old is just starting to grow up and use this language when you are not looking so honestly... like i said before why not
I, a parent of 2 kids both are 11
