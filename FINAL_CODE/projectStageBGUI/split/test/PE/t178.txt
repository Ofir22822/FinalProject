A fun game that lives up to the Pok?mon expectation
As a veteran player, this game was on the easy side of the difficulty scale but is suitable for younger audiences. The game characters themselves tell the player character to expect the battling to get tough throughout their Gym Challenge, which is a nice touch. Most, if not all, characters are lively and are friendly towards the player character. The rivals of the player character never have any ill will towards them for besting them in Pok?mon Battles, and all strive to better themselves in a positive manner, which isn't at all uncommon to see in the Pok?mon series. If you/ you and your child care about the fact that over half of the Pok?mon that exist aren't obtainable in the base game, fear no more, as the expansion DLC that is releasing in two parts, later this year (2020). The DLC is going to add in brand-new content, as well include AT LEAST 200 more obtainable Pok?mon, some of which will contain returning Pok?mon, a Pok?mon with a new Regional Form, and completely new Pok?mon. The DLC expansion pass is constantly advertised in a banner in the in-game menu, SOMEWHAT pressuring players to buy it, but the small banner could be temporarily (shows back up each time the game is booted back up, which could be annoying to some, not to me, really) turned off by clicking the Right Stick. Now to denounce other people's reviews! The review addressing the lack of gimmicks from previous games is kind of bunk, as it's simply "out with the old, in with the new". The review speaking about characters "scantily clad with two-piece swimsuits" is also nonsense, as the "some characters" (the Water-type Gym Leader Nessa, the females of the Swimmer trainer class) only wear swimsuits that one would typically see females wearing at a pool and/or the beach. Nothing to be alarmed about, honestly. Yes, the graphics could be better by today's standards, the story is simple to a fault, and there has been glitches and bugs reported, but nothing game-breaking. The smartphone app Pok?mon HOME (releasing Feburary 2020) will help with the transfer of Pok?mon from older games into this one.
there will be many negative reviews from those who haven't played it. So I'm here to combat that.
I played the pokemon games on the DS and gameboy. I totally skipped the 3DS line and was excited to see how much pokemon evolved after almost 10 years...and I was so disappointed. I tried as hard as I could, but I could not
