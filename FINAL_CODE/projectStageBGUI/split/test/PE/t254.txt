 think how you represent the game is bogus. You must be a softcore gamer or just trying to pump out quality quickly because the outer worlds is chalk full of choices and consequences. There is consumerism. I mean the whole plot is that big corporations have taken over the colony. I don't know if you guys even play the game or just watch some random guy on youtube. Another topic I'll pick at it positive role models- in an RPG game its a given there are role models. The description you give for positive role models fits the bill if you said there were role models so I don't understand why you don't just put like 3 stars. Everything else seemed spoton- this is a great game where tons of love was poured into it and that's what I want to see more of- not cash in triple A games or indies but something in-between where it s clear everyonr loved working on it.
This game is amazing. While it has minor blood (cartoonish at that) the game is far from mindless killing. The open world and extensive choices remind me of Skyrim. The Intense violence and Blood and Gore is an major exaggeration, and there is minor mild language and one drug reference. It really is a game for 15+. ERSB has exaggerated many titles this is one of which.
Some gore but its very cartoonish, fantasy-based, non-brutal and avoidable.
This game is beautiful in every interaction. I loved how when I played it alone and when my son played it with me. It showed how much we think the same but also showed some differences between us. He liked playing as a more moral character than me. I liked The twist of being more evil(this is always how it’s been in RPGs for me,) we both got different endings to the game. I thought that was really amazing. It really is wonderful how much games have changed in my lifetime. In conclusion this is a great game it may be violent and vulgar at times but it tells a great narrative. I really loved it!
Awesome game, diverse set of characters. This is a single player and as of writing there is no micro-transactions, which basically means no in game sales for real money. While this is a game with guns, moderate violence and swearing, that's not the point of the game. The game is basically one big adventure akin to the Fallout series. The world reacts to you depending on how you play, most of the time you can talk your way through most missions without even firing a shot. The main story is that you're trying to wake some people on a ship, to do that you need some special chemicals. On your journey to get these chemicals you discover some big corporations have taken over and a few groups of people are holding on their freedom. The game also contains a wide assortment of side missions. If you let
