 So as long as you make sure family friendly turned on it should be fine. One problem is everyone must have a device with a web browser.
Really good party game. Five party games smashed into one. The thing you should watch out is Trivia Murder Party. It is pretty disturbing, over all it's a good game for the family.

Overwatch.........
Here is the motto of Common Sense Media. "If the game is teen it must be rated by us 13 or higher" But come on this is Overwatch. Overwatch has no profanity, sex, or drugs. I don't count a cowboy smoking tobbaco drugs. He isn't smoking a blunt. I don't count a mildly provocative character as sex. Bare nudity? No. Full Nudity? No. Sex Scenes? No! Sex is at a 0. Of course there is violence in a fighting game! But the blood is about as equal to the Skylanders series which is at a 5 for commercialism because having all characters will cost a whopping 3000 dollars (around). However this game got a 4 rating which is one measly less. All you buy in this game is cosmetics not freaking characters like SkyScammers and BattleBorn The Leach. CMS states the game has lots of merchandise like t-shirts and toys. Every game does. But not everygame has a level 4 on commercialism! Characters getting dismembered? Why is this in the age review!!! The training robots and one robotic character will fall apart upon death with no blood! Just like in SkyScammers. Honestly an 8 year old can play this game without it tainting their mind but they'll never get the chance when parents see the number 13 up there. Take it from me. This is fine for the average eight year old! There are also pretty good messages and role models with a very nice moral background which communicates the goods and bads of wars as well as multiple viewpoints too not only educate but immerse their viewers in a realistic world that is unrealistic. LOL! It's very easy to play the game. Characters take seconds to learn but hours to master just like a good fighting game should do. Button mashing will get you nowhere but good reflexes, playstyle, and strategy will! The game is a blast and CMS is famous for not allowing great games to be
