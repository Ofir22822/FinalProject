 violence takes place within text descriptions, which can occasionally be graphic or disturbing-however nothing is ever shown. Gameplay and stories contain elements of Cosmic Horror, but not nearly as much as the previous game, Sunless Skies. | Sex: No visible sex or nudity. Occasional light allusions to sexual activity within the text. | Language: All language is censored within the game. | Drugs: Occasional references within the text to alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as smuggling of fictitious drugs (such as hallucinogenic honey). A handful of character portraits depict still images of lit cigarettes.
BEST GAME SERIES EVER!
This game is AMAZING! The story will pull your heartstrings, the combat is easy, and more! The only problem I had with CSM's review is that they said that it had a load of consumerism. But it's only that Disney worked with Square Enix (The company behind Final Fantasy), and that would mean that Disney characters will meet and become friends with Final Fantasy characters! And they're ALL a part of the story! I love this VG (Video Game) Series, and I think It's the BEST GAME SERIES EVER!
This is part of the BfA expansion, and is not recommended
First off, you should be aware that World of Warcraft: Tides of Vengeance is a PATCH and not an EXPANSION of the game. The current expansion is Battle for Azeroth (BfA), and you must buy BfA and pay a monthly subscription. BfA is the worst expansion in the 15 year history of WoW. I have played the game since 2007. As a parent, I would not let a child that is in school, play this game. Not because it has bad content, but rather the sheer volume of time required. WoW has destroyed many young careers due to endless grinds that eat up a lot of precious time. In my opinion, this game is for adults that can manage their time. Not for children, even though they could easily play it. There are better games out there for kids, in my opinion.
A great re-imagining of the original with the stunning graphics of Capcom's RE Engine being put to brilliantly grotesque use. It ain't one for the squeamish.
Dang, there is a lot of blood!

Resident Evil 2 is the 2019 remake of the classic PS1 horror game from the late 90's. You follow two survivors, rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, sister of the original game's Chris Redfield as they search the amazingly claustrophobic Racoon City to discover the truth as to why the local populace have turned into the flesh-devouring undead and other more dangerous monsters. Firstly, by survival-horror game standards especially,
