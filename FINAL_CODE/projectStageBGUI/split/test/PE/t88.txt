 be worth noting that this is his first year in a new school and he was very anxious about fitting in. The game has 18 on the box but I did research and found out that provided you turn off blood and swearing that makes a game 16s so I deemed it acceptable for him to play. I sat with him once and I have to say he was having fun and it was not too bad when you put it in context. It actually taught him a lot about modern day war. So I think the game is fine for 13 and up.
i have been playing this game for a couple months and it is great. the campaign might be scary for younger kids but if your child is at least 11 and mature he should be fine. it has a little bit of scary images and torture but if you turn off the blood and gore it should be ok.

It may be a sensitive topic but children these days have experienced these things and parents shouldn’t pretend that their child isn’t ready and mature enough for it.

There are outstanding role models, both female, and male. Race, gender, and other topics are all not discriminated and you play as several different ones. It is a great game and is just lazily grouped with other Call of Duty games.
I have been watching my son playing this game for the past week and a bit. Now as a parent I care a lot about my son and at first, I was hesitant to oblige to my son's pleas for me to purchase the game for him. I was also wary of the MA15+ rating but to overcome my queries and quell any questions of the true age limit. I decided to purchase the game and play it myself and soon came to discover that the game's campaign (story mode) is the more violent and
