 scar your kid for life. Think of it as when Thanos snaps the avengers into dust, to put it that way. Online chat is there, but you can mute people.
It’s a who done it murder mystery and in this wacky hello neighbor spin off you use teamwork and trust to survive the neighbor’s wrath!
I think it a great game its kinda scary but play it with a friend and your fine If your sensitive to minor jumpscares then it not the best game for you.
THE ADULT IS WRONG(the one who posted the 13+) the neighbour is not creepy whatsoever otherwise it would be a pegi 12. But it is not it is a PEGI 7. This is a fun game to play. I said 7 and up for people who don't mind scary things but even if you get creeped out by a lot of things this would be a solid 9 or 10 yr. Most people ignore when kids give ratings BUT THIS IS TRUE. Thank you.
A good Game
Too much sex
I think this is a great game. It is really fun to play and has creative and funny characters and names. I do not think there is anything inappropriate but if there is anything I missed very few kids would see it or understand it.
Too many sexual references for small children, my 16 boys were all shocked by the graphic content in this game.
not the scariest
Sure, corpses and monsters, but if the person playing this game is not scared of those, it's perfectly fine! Cussing is frequent, but that only adds to the game's atmosphere!
It's Pretty Trash
It's OK
Literal Trash
My review
goooood
This game let's you be your own wrestler, slick!!!
The game overall is fun, but it is glitchy
Good but has some inappropriate stuff.
A few good and a lot of BAD
ty
My Opinion
If you think of buying this game please dont buy it It kinda sucks and is very hard to play
Some Violence but it will probably be ok for 7 and 8 year olds who like fighting games
Before you buy this game. Look up WWE 2k20 Angry Joe review. It states every reason why this game is trash.
Great game for kids. Blood is an option but its default is blood is off. Swearing is rarely heard in play or universe mode but some can be heard in career mode. If you like wrestling this game is great. Also kids who want to be a wrestler can make the superstar of their dreams in this game. Although making a move set for your characters is time consuming it pays off greatly when you go and fight someone. Universe mode is awesome because you can make your own shows and not worry about superstars you dont know ruining your match. Although in universe mode there is promos and you can sometimes choose swear words as an option. Make sure your kid knows what turning heel/face are because if you dont know what those mean you can mess up your universe really bad
fun fun very
