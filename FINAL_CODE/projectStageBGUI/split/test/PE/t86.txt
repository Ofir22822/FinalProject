 Strange. Combat isnt super deep or challenging but is one of the more fluid takes on the Souls formula. Theres also a large amount of blood and gore in combat (gushing blood, impaling and exploding foes) and throughout the world with mountains of gross rotting and scorched corpses. Especially in Skal lairs with disemboweled and impaled nude bodies. Moreso if you choose to lead areas into chaos with your choices. Fair amount of F words.
Not the best
This game is fun but only for a short amount of time. This game gets boring easily. I played this a lot when I was growing up though. Basically there is a monkey in a ball that has to pass the finish line as quick as possible, but while you’re at it you also have to collect as many bananas as possible for extra points. I recommend to users that like cartoon challenge/racing. — What’s in the game? Cartoon Violence - Players spend most of their time racing through tracks, but there are boss battles that pit players against large enemies. Combat generally involves dodging enemy attacks while charging up and rolling your ball into them.

Great game, but very violent and brutal.
Ok. I'm reading this review and I think these people went way overboard with their review. First, kids need to know about this stuff in the world. Second, this only refers to the campaign, as in multiplayer, you can barely see the blood. In the campaign, there are maybe a few bad scenes, but you can turn Gore and Dismemberment off in the settings. These people are crazy, and I think they need to play multiplayer, too
Firstly you know this is wrong when it says it has no role model value because it does. The video even said it itself when there are police and armed forces protecting country’s from terrorist threats. Surely armed forces hold some kind of role model value. This game in multiplayer mode is really not that bad and only a little cloud of blood when you kill someone. The language I admit is quite bad but it depends if you think your kid is mature enough. Multiplayer is not bad at all and campaign swears a little bit. I hope this review can help you decide on what you want to do.
I don’t get people are saying this game is bad.
Definetly 13+
I have 2 children aged 11 and 12 asking for the new call of duty despite knowing this game was fairly brutal I decided to look into the game after seeing CSM review It was a definite NO. I later reviewed the parent comments and found out
