 personally love his game especially the campaign . It’s not as violent as black ops 1 , world war 2 and world at war -to people who don’t know they are all call of duty games. I think this is the least violent multiplayer. The campaign can be dogy at times but is usually not violent at all.
This game is phenomenal! Sure it can be a bit gritty at times but you can turn blood and swearing. The campaign can be ( very rarely)disturbing but it portrays positive messages.
I havent bothered with the MP and the SP is very short at just under 4 hours (thankfully im not the one who bought the game) but its very intense and has the gameplay nuance and charm of MW1. Just dont expect a deep or morally grey story advertised so much (Russians are basically ISIS McHitler here). Its also the most graphic of the MW games. With gore akin to the Treyarch games; particularly the more grounded, brutal and disturbing kind seen in WaW or BO1 than the Tarintino-ish violence of BO2, 3 and 4. This time with 4K and photoreal detail.
This is the most disturbing, morally questionable campaign in Call of Duty history. Civilians are slaughtered by terrorists, chemical weapons are used, and war crimes are committed in abundance. Children are put in harm's way of the player. It is very much possible, and indeed likely, to kill innocent people. Players must have the maturity level to understand the seriousness of the scenarios they are in, and even then, pulling the trigger (or not) in the campaign can be straight-up traumatizing. The multiplayer portion of the game is visceral and impactful, but not nearly as harrowing as the campaign. Still, the use of white phosphorus as a kill streak is a morally bankrupt decision that taints the otherwise age 14+ multiplayer experience. That being said, Modern Warfare is a complete package. You cannot separate the campaign from the multiplayer as one grants access to the other. As a result, I highly recommend keeping this away from children altogether. The game could have carried an AO rating if it weren't coming from Activision. I have played every Call of Duty to date, and have logged thousands of hours on this franchise. This is not like the others. Don't dismiss the warnings of critics and other players. This game can and will give nightmares, and enables players to commit atrocities, by accident or otherwise. Do not make the mistake of buying this for children. Other Call of Duty games may be 'fine,' but Modern Warfare 2019 is best suited for those 18+.
oldie but goodie
This game is so fun and entertaining ! Lots of problem solving and hidden puzzles to unlock. Can be spooky but nothing your little ones can't overcome. If anything it teaches your child to brave, headstrong, and to never give up !
