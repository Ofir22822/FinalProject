 are a problem, as well as the consumerism, but otherwise I would say it’s fairly kid friendly. For these reasons, I’m giving this an age rating of 13+
Great game, I think you should let your kids play it. P.S. sorry for any typos or anything like that, I am not a native English speaker.

Overwatch Review
I absolutely love Overwatch. I have been playing for about a year. The game itself is completely fine, minus a couple of realistic looking guns, a little of blood, and a character that says "die, die, die" in a creepy way. The issue for kids under 12 is the voice chat. There are very "toxic" players in this game, and swear a lot. I have been paired with people who say the f word every 10 seconds. However, there is a way to disable voice chat, and it won't put you at a huge disadvantage. This game teachers great teamwork, but is addicting at times.
I apreciate the variety of characters with their own abilities and lore. The game mecanics are easy to understand and even though there is a ned to kill enemy players constantly there's not too much violence in it. However the comunity can by toxic sometimes and there are some provocative character models-
Like I said in my title, you don't have to use violence to win. There is healing, shields, teleporters, stuff like that. Anyone who says this game is "violent" go get a life. And get Overwatch. Cheers.
Kaden Cline had this as 10 years old, then Kaden Cline could get this for his Christmas 2018 as 11 years old. Now, I have this. Not so much violence!
The game content is pretty poor and most players are pretty toxic. Well tbh games with shooters generally have super toxic and salty players.
I think that it is a good game for older kids, (12 and older) because it s an FPS but it is not as bad as COD. It is more of a friendly FPS because it is not a real life game, it is more a fantasy game, more like Fortnite.
This game is great! If your a gamer then this game is a great addition to your collection. If your a younger kid like me, then its still a great game to get for your birthday or something. It's all about strategy and teamwork. There are also parental controls you can apply to the account, so you wont here any bad words through other teammates. Violence is moderate, weapons are ranged from explosives, guns, swords, bows, and fists.
