 the action is not fulfilled and everything knocked over is left down. If you want to shoot someone, you’ll need to knock them over with your disc - a challenging feat - without knocking over any items. You can potentially knock over your own characters in play, which causes them to lose a life. Lives are limited and characters can end up eliminated. Flick ’em Up is a very challenging dexterity game full of tricky aspects. Even the specific way you must flick is defined in the rulebook - you cannot flick using your thumb, forcing you to flick in a way that has less force and more control. The placement of your meeple determines where you can place your movement disc to be flicked, meaning you’ll need to pay attention to each move you make. Often your disc can get caught close to a building or scenery, meaning you’ll need to be extra careful in flicking and face a tougher challenge of lining up the perfect shot.
