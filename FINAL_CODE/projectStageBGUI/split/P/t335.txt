 with a bold and elegant understanding of its own systems. You could have all the stealth know-how and military training in the world, but out there in the unpredictable jungle of the Russian wilderness, you were exposed, vulnerable… a Naked Snake. And it worked. This weird shift in tone, structure – it all worked beautifully, and with a poetic edge that is unrivaled in other Metal Gear installments. Snake Eater is arguably one of the most interesting love stories ever told in a game, one of the strangest and most exciting Cold War-era adventures, and one of the first games to truly make me reflect on my actions as a player. It manages to be tragic, sometimes devastatingly so, and yet still maintain that absurd comedic flair that I admire about this series. Any game that can make you emotional about climbing a ladder deserves some kind of recognition. Did You Know? Hideo Kojima wanted someone else on his team to direct Metal Gear Solid 3, but when no one wanted to, he took on the role after all. The grandfather of Johnny Sasaki, the incompetent guard from the first game, watches over your jail cell in one scene in MGS3. Raikov's character is a parody of Raiden from Metal Gear Solid 2, who was infamous unpopular with many fans.
Released 2013 20 Jonathon Dornbush I still think about three moments in The Last of Us at least once a week, nearly five years later. The first is when Joel’s life changes in a moment in the game’s intro. I knew I was in for something so narratively special from Naughty Dog. The second moment solidified that, as, late into the game, it demanded I make a certain gameplay choice because that’s how Joel would act, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to do. That dissonance struck me, but made so much sense. This was Joel and Ellie’s story I was experiencing, and those characters feel so real thanks to the script, animation, and Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson’s stellar performances. The Last of Us marries its storytelling with its gameplay, and nothing made me feel more than that last moment. The game’s final discussion between its two protagonists that is filled with so much emotional weight because of their experience – because of what you experienced – that it’s difficult to think of another ending so perfectly true to this unforgettable experience. Did You Know? The Infected were inspired by cordyceps, a type of killer fungi that takes over the bodies of insects. Alan Weisman's book The World Without Us served as partial inspiration for the game's scenery and setting. Naughty Dog fought to keep Ellie on the cover of the game – many publishers feel that games with women on the cover will sell less.
Ryan McCaffrey DOOM changed my life. My gaming life, at least. Having spent my entire existence up to that point playing platformers, side-scrolling action games, etc. on 8- and 16-bit consoles, DOOM's first-person shooting
