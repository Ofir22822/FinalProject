 (2017) If “Link to the Past” set the blueprint for a huge chunk of the series, this is the only game to sidestep it completely. It draws inspiration from another: the original game. Like in the original, Link is given only a few moments to gather himself before he’s able to travel in any direction the player pleases, even toward the dark castle and the game’s final battle. The game was created with a singular vision: To recapture Miyamoto’s original intent of exploration purely led by the player’s own curiosity and imagination. Every aspect in this game’s design is in service of player freedom. It’s rare to see any pop culture franchise be so committed to rediscovering itself that it’s willing to upend every single aspect of its winning formula, but Nintendo did that here to wild success. The trust it puts in the player’s imagination has helped players form their own special relationship to it. The game’s physics engine is so unpredictable that to this day the “Breath” community continues to find new tricks to navigate Nintendo’s biggest game ever. Many fans report that it has helped them deal with depression and anxiety. Other game developers are currently studying it to figure out how exactly Nintendo created a “killer app” so compelling that for many, it became the sole reason for customers to invest in the new hardware. It’s the game that further cemented Nintendo’s legacy as the best creators of the craft, and the series as an industry flagship. Disagree with the list? Give your take in the comments.
