 series of crises, from food shortages to enemy ships in hot pursuit, all while hidden Cylons work to sabotage their efforts. It’s challenging enough even without the treachery, though the heroes do have some recourse: suspicious players can be kept out of trouble in the ship’s brig. The majority of social deduction games are short, to prevent the action dragging if the traitors get busted early. Battlestar Galactica is one of the exceptions that works very well, despite being a several-hour experience. One reason for this is the implementation of double agents: players that start out on the straight and narrow but are revealed halfway through to be secret cylons - just like on the show! One of the greatest hidden role games of all time, Battlestar doesn’t see much play nowadays only because it’s been out of print for years and requires forking out a truckload of cash to pick up second-hand - though fan-made mods do exist for the game on Tabletop Simulator.
