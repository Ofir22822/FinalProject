 a spiritual successor to the North Sea trilogy of worker-placement games by designer Shem Phillips. An updated version of Raiders of the North Sea, Raiders of Scythia trades out Vikings for Scythians, the nomadic ancient empire where men and women fought together against Persia and Greece. It just released this summer - which is well-timed given that Charlize Theron recently played a Scythian warrior in Netflix series The Old Guard. Aside from offering some fascinating history, the gameplay is strong, forcing players to balance the resources needed to deploy their forces far from home and the pressure to be the first to raid a given area and claim its spoils. Players determine how successful their raid is by rolling dice - earning greater rewards for big numbers but risking injury to their crew, making them less effective until they go home to heal. Balancing the benefits of patching up your fighters against letting them die and recruiting new ones with different special abilities is a major part of the game’s strategy. Fighters can travel with horses and eagles that enhance their power and special abilities. Almost all the cards can be played in different ways depending on whether you want them to stick around or just have an immediate effect. You’ll need to carefully consider which cards to hold back to play as the game progresses and which you should use for a quick edge. Buy Raiders of Scythia on Amazon US and Amazon UK.
