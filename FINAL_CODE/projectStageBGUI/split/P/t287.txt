 eat as many brains as possible while avoiding shotgun blasts - the zombies' natural predator. While the dice rolls are entirely random, the strategy lies in determining when to stop rolling and enjoy the brains you have. Dice come in three different levels of danger; holding onto a red die is practically begging for a shotgun blast to the face. If you accumulate three shotgun blasts before stopping, you have been sufficiently triple-tapped into oblivion. Don't get too greedy, we all want some piece of mind.
