 cutscenes and dialogue, making it quite immersive. Rucoy Online Price: Free (with IAP) Download: Android Last off, we have an interesting indie proposition. Rucoy Online might not feature the stunning graphics of Lineage 2, for example, but it can definitely be charming for nostalgia buffs that yearn to play something that resembles the SNES version of Legend of Zelda. The combat mechanics are pretty straightforward - you just tap on anything that you want to kill or interact with. In addition to that, you have your standard leveling, skill, and loot systems. What's interesting about this game is that you can instantly switch between the three available classes - Knight, Archer, and Mage. Sadly, Rucoy Online isn't available on iOS at the moment.
