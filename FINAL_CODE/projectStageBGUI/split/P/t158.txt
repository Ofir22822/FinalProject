 it nails the mundane. Geralt’s fantasy world is one of mud, thatch and metal, his main quests are freelance work, and he loves a game of cards down the pub. That sense of reality is what helps you empathise with Geralt, understand the world, and really understand how bad things have gotten when the crazy shit starts popping off. An RPG with enough complexity to satisfy the urge to tinker, but enough character never to feel impersonal, Wild Hunt is a staggering achievement no matter how you look at it. Its story deftly balances cosmic threat and family drama, its choices feel truly meaningful and world-changingly effective, and it looks gorgeous in its own grubby way. Even its two DLC expansions are among the best ever released. Geralt’s final journey might be built on the mundane, but that makes it nothing short of magical. Did You Know? Doug Cockle, the English voice of Geralt, bought a console to play The Witcher 3 – the first Witcher game he decided to play. Developers at CD Projekt Red cited Dark Souls as a major influence on The Witcher 3's combat system. Dynamic beard growth causes Geralt's facial hair to grow over time.
Released 2007 27 Jonathon Dornbush BioShock will likely always be remembered for its game-changing “Would You Kindly?” twist, but the first adventure in Rapture is so much more than a dressed-up dupe. From first encountering a splicer caring for a gun the way a mother cares for her baby to the still-enrapturing Andrew Ryan twist toward the game’s end, BioShock delivers one enrapturing setpiece after another.

So much story is embedded in the dilapidated hallways and shuttered rooms of Rapture, a decaying underwater labyrinth that demands to be investigated. The mark of a good experience is one that you keep thinking about long after you’ve finished it. And I still haven’t stopped thinking about BioShock, its incredible location, and those awesome Plasmids, over a decade later. Did You Know? Ayn Rand's philosophical system of Objectivism forms much of the foundation that Andrew Ryan's utopian vision for Rapture was rooted in. Even Andrew Ryan's name is a play on Ayn Rand. Some original designs for the Little Sisters, before they became actual little girls, were slugs, crabs, and injured dogs.
Released 2010 26 Dan Stapleton Civilization IV is a great turn-based strategy game on its own, but it wasn’t until the Beyond the Sword expansion that it became truly legendary, and the highlight of the 28-year-old Civilization series. The changes it makes are sweeping: it adds corporations, which add another religion-like layer, fleshes out the espionage system and victory conditions, and enhances the AI to put up a great fight. Meanwhile, random events ranging from tornadoes to baby booms make every playthrough even more unique and eventful than ever before. And we remind you, that’s on top of a game that’s so addictive to begin with that it’s
