 character on the box or starred my beloved Ninja Turtles. But even then, although I lacked the vocabulary to explain it, I knew that Super Mario Bros. was special, and better than almost everything else. So when I received Super Mario Bros. 3 from Santa one year, and saw on the back of the box that Mario could fly, I knew I was in for something special. The game exceeded my every hope and wish for it, and I spent hundreds of blissful afternoons defeating Koopa Kids, rescuing kings, and discovering secrets strewn throughout Mushroom World. Mario 3 earned a place on my list of favorite games way back in 1990, and 25 years of gaming progress have yet to dislodge it. Super Mario Bros. 3 is a textbook example of how to make a perfect video game sequel. It’s a mixture of the original’s best elements, combined with an almost excessive amount of imaginative new ideas. So much of what we consider so quintessentially Mario – the suits, the boos, the overworld – all actually originated here. Did You Know? Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Mario game to introduce an overworld. The Super Leaf allowed Mario to fly for the first time. It came out in the US almost a year and a half after Japan.
Released 2017 05 Brian Altano The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild eschewed the semi-linear, borderline predictable path of the 3D Zelda games before it in favor of a bold, crazy new approach: let players do what they want, how they want, and in whatever order they decide. By marrying an open-ended approach to quest structure with the ability to freely explore a vast, beautiful, intriguing world with little specific regulation, the 3D Zelda game template was shattered about as fast as the average breakable weapon in Breath of the Wild. The result is a gorgeous, freeing open-world action/adventure experience that evokes the wonder and fear of exploring a bold new place with the empowering tangibility of becoming its hero. Did You Know? There are 900 Korok Seeds hidden across Breath of the Wild's massive map and finding them all will reward players with one of the weirdest prizes in the history of Zelda games - a useless, golden statue shaped like a turd. Speedrunners have taken a huge liking to Breath of the Wild due it its freeform quest layout, allowing skilled players to bypass most of the game's content and take on the final boss fight very early on. Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild's launch bridged Nintendo console generations by getting released at the very tail end of the Nintendo Wii U as well as the launch day of the Nintendo Switch.
Released 1994 04 Justin Davis Super Metroid’s minimalistic environmental storytelling set a bar, way back in 1994, that I believe has still yet to be eclipsed. The planet Zebes is atmospheric, oppressive, and extremely lethal. At first glance, there doesn’t even
