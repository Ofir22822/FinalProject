 The Masquerade – Bloodlines is considered to be both one of the greatest vampire games ever made and one of the greatest RPGs for those who value decision making and character building. This long-awaited sequel seeks to continue the original game’s considerable legacy. Highlighted by a much-improved combat system, Bloodlines 2 could reach new heights for the series. Wasteland 3 August 28 | inXile Entertainment | XBO, PC, PS4 The precursor to the Fallout franchise, Wasteland made a successful return in 2014 as a throwback to the days of isometric RPGs. Widely-acclaimed for its deep RPG mechanics and incredible world, Wasteland 2 fed the need for a role-playing experience with modern sensibilities. Wasteland 3 features many of the innovations and brilliant mechanics of Wasteland 2 but introduces an expanded emphasis on vehicles as well as a morbid sense of humor that we’ve only previously seen glimpses of in past installments. Watch Dogs: Legion TBA | Ubisoft | PS4, XBO, PC The original Watch Dogs was an interesting experiment in open-world design, but it failed to achieve its loftiest goals. The second game fared much better, but it failed to find as large an audience as it should have. But Watch Dogs: Legion‘s mechanic that lets you play as any NPC in the game world may just prove to be the hook that the second game needed. It may sound like a gimmick, but from what we’ve seen of Legion so far, the game appears to intelligently use this fascinating new way to play.
