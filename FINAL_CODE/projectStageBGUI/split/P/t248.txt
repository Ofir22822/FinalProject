 a whole gang at a time and the removal of Overwatch, which led to gangs bunkering down with heavy weapons, intent on interrupting the opponent’s turn at every opportunity - an inherently boring tactic.

You can’t write about Games Workshop boxed games without including the Orkiest, killiest, speediest game there is. Think Mad Max but with Orks instead of Max. If you were put off by recent underbaked spiritual sequel Speed Freeks, don’t panic - Gorkamorka pits Orks against themselves in fast, frantic gameplay. Watch out for silly rules that involve stacking models on top of one another clown-car-style to determine a vehicle’s carry capacity or painting your vehicles red to get a movement bonus. Best played as a part of a campaign and without taking things too seriously, Gorkamorka is a delicious snapshot of the best of ‘90s Games Workshop. The models are a little dated 20 years on, but what’s the point of playing Orks if you aren’t converting and kitbashing as much as you can? While not as widely available as some of the games above, copies of Gorkamorka can occasionally be found on sites such as eBay.
