 heroes, including a number of recognizable DC heroes and villains. The roster is still growing. Drag'n'Boom Download A really addicting arcade game where you control a mini dragon in its quest for gold. You use your left thumb to launch the dragon around and the right thumb to aim fireballs at various enemies. Each time you prepare for a shot, time slows down, allowing you to aim better and making you feel like a bad... Samuel Jackson in the process. Great time-burner!

There's also multiplayer both in the form of co-op and PvP. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery Download An adventure set in the universe of... well, Harry Potter.

You can play this one in competitive multiplayer where your goal is to win the race, collect as many rings as you can, and possibly push some of your adversaries into obstacles and ruin their day.
