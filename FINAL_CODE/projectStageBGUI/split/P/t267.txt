 in 1989, it’s arguably one of the most influential board games of all time, proving that Dungeons & Dragons wasn’t the only way that players could experience an epic and immersive adventure. Despite going on to influence dungeon-crawlers from Imperial Assault to Gloomhaven, HeroQuest had all but vanished by the millennium, fading into the memories of those who played it in their youth. Until now, as in late 2020 Avalon Hill and Hasbro announced that they would be reviving the HeroQuest name. The new HeroQuest won’t apparently be treading any new ground; instead, it looks to be a faithful recreation of the 1989 original. Copies of HeroQuest have become notoriously difficult - or expensive - to track down in the decades since its release, making a new edition of the game undeniably a light in the darkness for fans of the series. However, there will be some minor changes that look to bring the classic board game up to speed with certain advancements made in the last thirty years, such as the inclusion of female-identifying characters in both the party and the rogues’ gallery that players will face. Other than that, the title looks to remain mostly unchanged in regards to gameplay - with players once again selecting between a roster of characters based on various fantasy archetypes, before embarking a heroic quest.

Even though the crowdfunding campaign was exclusive to the US and Canada, excited individuals in the UK can get their hands on a copy next autumn from the online retailer, Zavvi - ensuring that as many fans as possible can get their own copy of the highly anticipated board game.
