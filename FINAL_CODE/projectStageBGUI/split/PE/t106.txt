 year old child can’t handle this game you are wrong. I’ve played this for two days now and I feel like the European PEGI rating (16+) is wrong. The ESRB (American) rating isn’t too bad. (T For Teen (13+)) The game is fantastic and has nice graphics. It’s a bit violent but not more or less violent than Fortnite. You can see a bit blood but it’s barerly visible.) The game is in my opinion a mix between Titanfall, Overwatch and Fortnite. I’ve enjoyed this game and I think that your 10 year old kid should be able to do that too.
I think that it is a good game for, as it says in the rating, teens. I feel that anyone younger than 12 should not play a game like this.
Its really good and not gory at all. I think its good for 13 +. It is good and not bloody and is good for people who like fps and battle royales the thing about this game is that you have to have good aim or else you cant get kills.
I think that it’s fine for other kids since it reminds me of a mix of fortnite with overwatch except that it looks different
great GREAT gameplay but hase blood and mostly for COD player who wants a battle royale experience
it has cool characters with different powers but some of them have dark voice lines but other than that it is fun am entertaning.
They say it's good game
My sister and I love play apex legends. It has amazing graphics and a fantastic story behind every character that makes you more invested in the game. While there is a bit of cursing, it isn't enough to detour me from play. My mom loves the game to even if she has to spend money every once in a while.
The game can be really fun most of the time. the game can become a bit disturbing with the kill animations but other than that, its really fun
