 gum. Some prostitutes may ask for assistance but the player can only decline or reject. Briefly naked shot of two people. Some language but not nearly As much as other games and films. Hateable characters (like Micah)
First off the story, writing and music is some of the best I have ever seen, and I have played a lot of games. The game play and weapons are a bit repetitive but like I said the story, writing and music make up for any fault. This is a must buy for any good time
Although it’s can be slightly dark and sad, this has to be my favourite game off all time, it has amazing characters that you get attached to and the story is fantastic , and that’s an understatement. All and all I think this is appropriate for mature middle aged teens.
