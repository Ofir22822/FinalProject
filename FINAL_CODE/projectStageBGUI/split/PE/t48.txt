 goes flying straight up. Then he teleports underground and slices the body upwards from behind from the crotch. And then he does this cool little trick where the head comes down and he finishes off by slicing the head as soon as it's within his aim. Shao Kahn's Fatality: He hits his opponent with his big hammer twice. And then he slams his opponent's head through his/her torso and the severed head goes flying above WITH THE FRICKITY FRACKING SPINE STILL ATTACHED TO THE HEAD, THE COLOR RED EVERYWHERE, AND YOU TELL ME THAT EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE EXPLAINED TO YOU DOESN'T MATTER AND YOU STILL THINK THAT YOUR FIRST GRADE TODDLER CAN PLAY THIS GORE FEST GAME!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! Well, your small children might tell you "yOU CaN tURN oFf tHE goRE tHRouGH thE seTtiNgS!" and that ladies and gentlemen is total BS! Even if the game developers made that an option, no one would use it, so why put it there in the first place?? Because its NOT. FOR. LITTLE. KIDS. AND. IT. NEVER. HAS. BEEN. SINCE. 1992. Sooooo yeah that was my essay on MK11. I hope you now understand that Mortal Kombat is extremely violent and bloody. Give your kids around 6 more years of growing and brain development and then they can play. Don't worry, Mortal Kombat games aren't going extinct in years to come. It will still be available. What I would consider the family-friendly version of MK is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the switch. Buy your kids that instead, they'll enjoy it as much as I enjoy MK11. Time for me to skidaddle outta here! *drops mic* *yeets away* *crowd slowly claps*
Look this game is very brutal I play it my self and it can be very disgusting at times but that is only the fatality a fatality is and the end of the game when you finish a player off and nearly all of them are brutal but the actual game is fine there is a bit of blood but the only thing that makes this game an 18+ is the fatality’s down I’d say if your kid can handle gore and blood and disgusting things like that then I think it fine to let them play this game I play and I really enjoy when I first played with a fatality I was a bit scared and disgusted but it is really fine if your kid is mature
The overall game play is the same as previous mortal kombats, the violence is a little toned down, but the character design is not good. They have made the characters have an injustice look to them, and not as cool as they were in previous games. In terms of age limits, if you are a mature 14 year old then this game should be okay as long as you dont do the fatalities.
Well if it is THis is super duper duper duper disappointing I was not exspected this much viloence i swear i played
