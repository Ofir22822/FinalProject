 find Boris (your sweet, compassionate sidekick,) cut open and experimented on for who knows what. I'm only into the game to about season three, (or four? I lost track.) but I've heard some rumors of satanic rituals. in later chapters, though I'm not sure if they are, well, realistic. ALSO Alice angel is nightmare fuel, Plain and simple.
BATIM is a very good game but ink bendy, alice angel and sammy laurence just makes it not for kids.
I love this game and think that anyone who can handle the content (even upper elementary kids) can play this game! I only use age ratings to see whats in the game. I think as long as they aren't paranoid or reenacting scenes in real life after playing the game, anyone can play it. The shooter game in chapter 4 can be pretty frustrating though, especially on a console.
people will definitely think that the age is too low but honestly, it depends on how they can handle the jump scares. I was looking for scary games and I found it and honestly, great plot line, and its just a scare and the player is not scarred. They just come and go.
This game's perfect for your kid if they like adventure/horror. Not satanic, bendy isn't the devil (yes, he is a demon), and no blood, but ink. The story is engaging and will open up creativity, and the ending is full of questins for you to answer. Recommend!
i think this game is amazing and everybody should play it.
Let’s just say “creepy rituals and being chased by strange looking monsters make from ink”. BATIM has the perfect level of horror and the perfect level of adventure for the young ones. The biggest shock is that you can see into the guts and flesh of one of the characters at the beginning, middle and end what is pretty disturbing. Other than a sword being put through someone and someone’s head being torn off it’s a pretty cool story with a bit of spook throughout.
