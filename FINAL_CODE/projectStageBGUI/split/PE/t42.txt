 f word several times by bad guys but not from the main characters.
This game is truly amazing, it really is. Being a historical fiction game on the black plague. But no way in HELL is this for kids. Not only is it scarily realistic and disgusting (coming from someone who's not queasy) this game is incredibly gory, showing bodies being sacrificed and burned alive as well as thousands of rats eating animals or humans. As far as language goes it can get pretty extreme. Common sense is wrong because there are f bombs from Spanish soldiers and they might not have heard it because that's side dialogue. But as far as main dialogue, nobody says anything to extreme. One thing that's great about this game is it encourages stealth, not killing. When Amicia does kill someone she is heavily affected and makes you really think about killing in games. Thank you for reading.
