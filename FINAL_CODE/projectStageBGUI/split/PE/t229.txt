 as Chems in the game, if you drink too much you have to suffer the consequenses of being addicted to it. I haven't encountered anything horror like yet because I mostly like gathering resources to build my dream base. The franchise is supposed to be horror but there isnt scary music and the lighting is really bright, if your looking to be in an open-world post nuclear apocolaptic world and you like to explore I highly recomend this game. There is not any sexual content nudity. The swearing is what I think got this game to a 17+. In a game one F bomb can turn a game into a 17+ game based on experience. The blood is really animated so its really not all that bad.
The game is too glitchy and the community is toxic asf. And bethesda thinks its the best game ever. Also, fallout 1st is a joke. $100 a year is too much.
This game is a buggy, pay to win, microtransaction filled, unplayable game. No sane human wants this game, spend your money on anything else other than this.
Fallout 76 is mildly bloody and not at any gore what’s so ever or swearing the game does not deserve to be ma

FALLOUT 76 is a very gory science-fiction game. There is some drinking and also some rare use of salty language. The main thing parents will need to know about is the violence, blood and gore.
Compared to Fallout 4, this is a child's game. There are no raiders to cuss at you, there are no other humans (NPCs,) making it harder for you to see exploding heads, only seeing it when near other people, which is rare (25 per server.) There are fictional drugs, called chems, and alcohol, but these both give you negative side effects as well as positive ones.
