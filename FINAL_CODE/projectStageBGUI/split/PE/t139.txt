 can almost be forgotten as being in the game. Overall, I would say that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a game appropriate for all ages, however very hard to play. Despite this learning curve, this game is definitely an extremely fun highlight in Nintendo's library, worth it for those willing to take the time to practice.
It's a great game with fun for everybody not really that violent online isn't the best but otherwise great game and the dlc is also amazing.
This is a awesome game, I've played before. -NO BLOOD -Some Violence -Easy controls I've been playing for 7 years now!
too good it gets me so pumped up i play it all most all day it is so cool for family's but it's really fast for your eyes so that's what you have to get use to that jelly.
I love the series but I do not like this game. Some fantasy violence.
It's not that violent, but some characters have sexual traits. I saw my friend's younger sister which is about 8 years old playing this, and I was shocked.
It's almost everything i hoped for in a smash game. The only thing that's disappointing for me is the storymode but that's because we didn't get one for a while and so i had high expectations. But the overal game is amazing i really like the spirit board, and the fighters pass keeps you playing for a while.
