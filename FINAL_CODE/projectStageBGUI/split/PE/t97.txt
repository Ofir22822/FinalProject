 been a good display of what Triple AAA companies can do now. With the new edition of Metro: Exodus, you play as the main protagonist Artyom, a survivor of the Metro, and battle your way through the Post-Apocalyptic tunnels of the once great Moscow metro! This game is a horror/survival, along with a FPS. It has some very intense and scary scenes which may be found not suitable for young children. Therefore I do not recommend it for 14 and below.
