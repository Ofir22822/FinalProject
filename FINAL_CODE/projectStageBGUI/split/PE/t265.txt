 In saying this, I would argue that most scenes of violence in the game could be handled by an older teen, perhaps 16 and up. The content stays true to its MA15+ Australian rating, and playing the game as a 15-year old, I found the game's violence and themes were nothing I hadn't seen before. I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone under my age, but putting that aside, this is a beauty of a game that deserves to be enjoyed!
