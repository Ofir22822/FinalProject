 player good.
The funnest thing for a dream chaser is the 2k19 MyCareer. As far as the gameplay and graphics it’s awesome. The MyCareer cutscenes on the other hand are way to long and it’s really bugging my time to play it. Thank god for the skip button but I wish I didn’t have to skip 20 darn cutscenes just so I can my player back on the court. It is nonsense 2k fix it.
Game is terrible . Don’t waste your money or time . Apparently players with 70 or under overalls are better than Giannis Lebron Harden etc. CPU fouls randomly when your not using . Just absolutely terrible. 2K needs to fix this broken game because it stinks .
Crashes a lot. Cannot coop in my league. Shooting mechanics are garbage. Don't care if they are going for realistic it is just not fun to play. start over and bring in a better game.
