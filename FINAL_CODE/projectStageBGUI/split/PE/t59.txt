 once you get the hang of the patterns, it’s fairly easy to beat the bosses, but if you’re new to the game, even the first boss might take at least twenty tries to complete. Even if you beat the game with fantastic scores on all the levels, it can STILL be hard to play through a second time. The Grim Matchstick for example. I have only beaten him two times, and I don’t know how I did it either one of them. On my second playthrough of the game, I only had around one or two hundred deaths, and at least half of those were from the Grim Matchstick, and the other half were from King Dice. Basically, Dark Souls is out of a job as the hardest game ever. For my final verdict, Cuphead is designed to infuriate and enrage. But when it’s not doing that, it’s meant to be a love letter to classic animation. And it succeeds. If you can tolerate hundreds and hundreds of failed attempts on a single level, then you might be able to beat Cuphead. And if you do, it truly is a spectacle to behold. Score: 100/100
Ok, content wise this game is like 8 and up, but the game is so hard probably matured 12+ would be able to play it without raging alot, also this game is about memorizing patterns so if you have ADHD it might not be as fun, this game is fun though, some parts I hated but when I came back to it it was alot of fun to replay. This game is also very gorgeous music and graphics wise the 1930s style hand drawn graphics and jazz music suit the game perfectly, although it's hard to appreciate when the game is so chaotic
Wow, when I heard that this game existed I was amazed. The graphics, the music was some of the best video game music since Undertale. A bit of drugs, gambilng and alcahol but besides that, it's great!
