 are tow many glitches and bugs i cant keep count of the most pain full glitch is that the hit boxes are complete trash i shot a guy in the foot and gave me a headshot medal there are sooooo many things i absolute hate about the game but the black out is fine i like it no glitches or bugs so far but the zombies ohhhhh the zombies the first thing i notice was that QR was 2000 pt and im wondering wow who would do such a thing to a perk thats been 500 pt on solo sence the first zombies i felt so mad and irritated but i wanted to see what elts they changed and the nexed part is no JUGG yep they removed juggernaut but in return they give you 1 extra hp but WHY jugg gives you 5-6 hp why would they remove jugg the thing come to mind that was if they were going to remove a important perk they better add a important perk and i think you know what im talking about yep PHD but no they didn't add it i was PISSED of how they could rune my intire child hood in one game of zombies i hate the new bo4 a hate the zombies i hate no campain i hate Litterly everything about that game and if you are thinking about bying it w i would suggest you think long and hard about it
This game does have quite a bit of blood people get legs and arms cut off blood seats when shot blood can be seen in backgrounds animals can be shot and killed character swear using words like F*ck, Sh*t, B*tch, *ss, and many others but the thing most people do not know is you can turn off graphic content when this is shut off no blood will be shown characters will not swear and if the game came out with non of the graphic content the game would go down to a T for Teen rating although some of the people you can interact with can swear and becuase of the custom profile pics people can make anything they want but you can mute all the people in the game and you can turn player made content off so this game is fine for teens but also enjoyable for adults.
it has alot of blood and language but you can turn it off but dont let you kid at all play specialist mode so much sex blood and more but your kid should be aloud to play this game cause i have seen a bunch of this stuff in real life for example i seen a guy fall over and his head was bleeding and blood was everywhere just to let you know this happened in real life so i think your kid could play this game with blood on if they seen alot of blood in real life but if they can't just let them play
