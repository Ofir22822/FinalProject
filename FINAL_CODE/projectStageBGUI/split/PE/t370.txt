 to expand the game. It does say $59 at the top of the page but thats for the Deluxe Edition (Deluxe Edition includes all of the add-ons so you dont have to get them later). Standard edition is only $30. Add-on packs range in price.
It’s my favourite driving game and i love the free drive feature, you get to drive to your races like a campaign buy cars and mods for it.
It's suitable for 2nd graders, and it just has some AI interaction, just a bit, no swearing at all. Even if you break speed limits, it's called having fun, being creative and customizing your cars in different ways!
I bought forza horizon 3 before this game came out and I was really impressed by it. When this game came out I really wanted it and its certainly lived up to my expectations. The graphics are so good. The showcase events are really fun and include loads of great scenery along the way. The online play is good but can be really hard for beginners as it doesnt seem to put you in races with other people that around your skill.
