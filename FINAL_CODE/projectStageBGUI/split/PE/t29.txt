 is just incredible. One of the best games you can play. There is violence with blood, the worst being the dad cutting off his finger to save his son. It doesn't show it come off, but he screams and cries and it is pretty disturbing. Any of the sex described in the review is up to the player to participate in. There is drug use, the FBI profiler is addicted to triptocaine, but it is up to the player to use it. Strong language throughout the game. This game is great and I reccomend it to anyone.
I've seen videos of this game; it's so amazing! The controls are realistic, gameplay is realistic, all in all, a game worth the 60 bucks.
Amazing, best game you will play on ps3. really difficult controls but still outstanding
Great story, Great voice acting, Great everything!
Heavy Rain is really good; the only bad thing is that some plot elements are not fully explained, and the controls are a little annoying, but it's great. However, this is a VERY mature game. There's lots of dark violence, sex, nudity, drugs, language, anything you can think of. The role models are good though; a father endures great pain to try to save his son. I highly recommend this for anyone 17 years old.
