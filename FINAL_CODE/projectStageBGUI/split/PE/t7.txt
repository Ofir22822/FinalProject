 tempt you to but the 3 DLC, which I played, and it's about the same as the game.
Spider man is a fighting game no doubt and its awesome! Spider man saving new york from Dr. Octupus who unleashed a pathogen. However, The game does show acts of terrorism which can be disturbing to younger kids who thought "I lOvE sPiDeR mAn". Other than that nothing else
Good game, very entertaining with really good graphics and nice sound effects. A lot of violence and language but violence typical of Spider man-shooting webs and getting shot at. Language is mostly the B word, the S word and the A word. There is a bad guy named Tombstone who deals and sells drugs to people and there is a lot of drinking. Depending on the player's maturity, it should be fine for 12 and up.
About the same level of, well, everything as a 12A (or PG-13) movie. It’s really bad that it received a pegi 16 rating over here in the UK. Suitable for nine year olds. Great game, mild violence, pegi sucks.
Spider-Man is like always, fighting crime in NYC, and there are some swearing, such as "crap", " damn", "hell", and more, so make sure you think about that before buying your kids this game. Lots of Fantasy Violence including Weapon use, punching, kicking, throwing, and more.
