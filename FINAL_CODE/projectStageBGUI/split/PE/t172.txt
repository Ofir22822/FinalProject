 In chapter 5 Sammy Lawrence killed by Tom, And fight the searchers together!! AWESOME!
1. The game is not that scary, so I think its ok for kids 9+ 2. The game is a puzzle game, but the puzzles aren't that hard.
This is my favorite game of all time! The story and gameplay are amazing! The characters are also great, Henry being my favorite with Shawn Flynn in a close second. When it comes to horror this game has jumpscares everywhere. There is no blood but you will jump. You have to kill ink creatures with pipes and axes but there is no blood, just ink. A character is stabbed with a sword in chapter four however. There are some other things like finding dead boris the wolves in certain places and the lost souls might scare younger players. The hallway part in chapter four is especially creepy. However, there is no language, or drugs. This game is great! I highly reccomend!
