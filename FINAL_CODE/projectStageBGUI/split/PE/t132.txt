 to do what it takes to save the city and his friends, even if it’s practically suicide. Both leads are resourceful and selfless throughout the whole adventure. Language is pretty normal. Just many uses of f—k and s—t in tense situations. Overall, it doesn’t matter what age you are, this game will terrify you in some way. However, anyone under thirteen who plays this is going to have nightmares. No question about it. Anyone under 15 probably won’t have the courage to finish the game. Honestly this is a M rated game that deserves the rating. Sure some kids younger than 17 can handle it, but 17 or 16 is a good safe age. The other people on here who are giving it a lower rating clearly did t play the game through, as it gets more intense and scary as it goes on.
It’s really violent! One of the most violent scenes is were a person is eaten in half. The rest I can say is just you will get disturbed.
It may look like this game is bad but when it comes to it think about your child. Is he/she aggressive, if so this game is not for them.
The only problem with this game is the hardcore difficulty setting. It's just too difficult. This game has and will continue to go down in history. Amazing game! 9/10
The game is perfectly fine and kids will have fun with the strong female lead and brave cop despite some blood
This game is great. It’s a remake of the original. It has strong language and violence but if you’ve played The Last of Us you would be able to play this.
