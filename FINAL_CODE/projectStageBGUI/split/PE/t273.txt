 choices that the game allows you to choose. You can be good, or not. You can help people or not, you can kill innocents, or not. However there is an undoubtable humongous amount of violence and content that is not for children. The game is not afraid to show gore and blood, crushed skulls, broken limbs. It is not afraid to drop some major s-words, b-words, a few f-bombs and more. This is a game MEANT for mature players. But now let’s move on to the bad stuff. Oh, wait, THERE IS NONE!!! (Except maybe a couple of glitches popping up here and there). This masterpiece is the peak of the mountain that is called video game evolution. It is original, it is engaging, and it is breathtaking. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite video games of all time, and if you have a PC, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, I highly recommend buying this game. The $60 dollars are undoubtedly worth buying if you want an entertaining and enjoyable time.
This game is Breathtaking, it is gorgeous I recommend it to anyone with the mental maturity of at least a 12 year old. Some sexual references but very little. Plenty of violence and swearing, I’ve seen parents’ ideas about checking in on their honor level, DON’T DO THAT, if you are not ok with the fact that your kid has the possibility of doing something bad don’t get them the game, no kid wants to be micromanaged like that an it may damage your bond with your child.
Basically a pg-13 movie apart from the sexual stuff which only happened once for me I would say your kids should play it when the are able to watch pg-14 movies
