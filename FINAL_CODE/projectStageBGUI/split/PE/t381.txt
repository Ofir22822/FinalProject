 is Strange, but I can say this about this one; It's really good and I think anyone could play this. There are minimal brutal scenes, just a couple. I would not let anyone under 12 play this game. It will enhance the experience the more mature you are. I really enjoyed it. There are no racist and/or "awful" political messages. The people saying that are overreacting and it's no more or less "extreme" content and characters you see in a normal movie. There are some swearwords, there is a blurred out cover of a dirty magazine and some violence, but that's all! I really recommend!
Story based game with lots of bad language and suited for teenagers and up. Also has talk of drugs and alcohol, as well as sexual content. Has scenes involving a police officer being racist towards a Mexican family, and the protagonist talks about drugs being used at a party, as well as sex.
I have been playing through all the life is strange games recently and I love all of them. But this one is by far the most mature. Language is present through out every episode including c**k, c**t, f**k, s**t and so forth and some of it is said by an 11 year old boy. But probably the biggest thing is the drug use. This is most apparent in episode 3. In episode three Sean and Daniel work on a weed farm and other characters use substances and smoke through bongs. Alcohol is also very apparent and characters get drunk and high. On top of that there is one scene in the beginning of episode 3 with a topless woman. Apparently there was a way to create a sexual encounter in episode three but I didn’t do it do to my choices but it’s still present. Violence isn’t huge but it’s present. Most notable being the beginning with the cops and the end of episode 3 and 4. In episode 3 Daniel freaks out over a characters death who is shot with a shotgun( dead body shown with wounds) and destroys the place and Sean loses his eye in the process. This is pretty graphic and shows Sean’s face covered in blood and his missing eye. At the end of episode 4 Sean is beat repetitively by a cult member and almost shot. While this isn’t awful you have the choice to kill the cult leader and it can be pretty frightening and the encounter in the church is very intense. But while this game definitely has its mature content it also delivers a very emotional narrative about brotherhood. Sean is willing to go through anything to protect Daniel and that is shown many times throughout the game. Their relationship felt very real and deep and I felt like I was Daniels brother trying to protect him. All and all this game is excellent and if your child wants to play it I would suggest playing it with them. Don’t let what I just said
