 The game doesn’t give you many tips on how to play which can be frustrating for new players, but there are plenty of videos on YouTube to help. The violence is cartoonish and there is never any blood.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a great game while playing solo, co-op, online, story, co-op online or the many more modes! But, it’s rated E10+ pretty fairly and is kinda close to T. VIOLENCE 6/10: Frequent use of guns, fists, poles, knives, fantasy objects and more to defeat your enemies. Every hit shows a splash effect other than blood, but still comes out as violent. The fighting is constant and required to play, and will push young children’s aggressive behavior pretty high if not at a certain age. In fact, this game and mortal Kombat are very alike. They are both at least 3x more impactful then CoD (Call Of Duty). LANGUAGE: There is No voice chat at all, and there is no text chat either. You have a selection of words to say ranging from “good job!” To “let’s smash!”. (This being a joke that’ll fly over kid’s heads). OTHER: Characters Frequently wear outfits that show extreme amounts of cleavage. This is usually women, but men go shirtless too. Nothing is sexual though. OVERALL: 8+
