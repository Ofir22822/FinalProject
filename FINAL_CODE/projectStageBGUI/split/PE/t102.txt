 bring your team with you. She also recives warnings from the voices of the void which will warn you when you are spotted or being looked at by another team and that let's you warn your teammates(while you can do this over the mic there are also tons of pings/markers which correspond with dialouge pre-written for your character allowing for you to communicate with your team very well without ever having to talk to them or have them hear you which is good if you don't want your kid talking to strangers) - Watson: She is a White Woman who is another good smart role model for kids as she is a engineering whiz and according to her bio always pursued her passion for acadmeics and is a genius. Her ablities revolve around electrical traps &amp; tools which can block stuff off(her security bars which are good for making a mini-base in a house for your team and her pylons which will intercept any ordances(grenades, gas traps, ziplines, etc.) and will recharge the sheilds(extra protection/health) of your team but be careful because the tech can't tell friend from foe and will destroy the traps and grenades of your own team so you have to work together to make sure you are not countering each others ablities). - Reveant: He is a robot/cyborg male who is the bad guy of the story and that shows in his game play as his lines are all evil and he only cares about death(kind of good message to have him be the bad guy) and his ablites are the Death Totem which keep people alive actually and will prevent people from dying when they are downed giving you more time to revive and it can heal while you fight(it goes with the cyborg theme as he is always replacing his body in the story) - Octane is either a lighter skinned Latino/Hispanic or a tan white skinned man who is supposed to be a speed craver and he sticks himself with this thing that makes him go faster but it makes him take some damage/get hurt. This was meant to make him look like an X-Games player as he takes the risk of getting hurt for all the fun &amp; thrill of going fast or jumping high since his other move is throwing a bouncy pad that launches him high in the air. Some people may mistake the way Octane is portyaed for it to show a Drug Addict but that is not what the devlopers were going for(this is per an interview from them) Crypto: He is a Philippiano/Asian man who is a tech genius who uses his cyber implats to give him a tactical advantage(sorry this descrpion is so short I just don't play as him much hence I don't have too much info on him) This game is so teamwork based and that is the awesome thing about it! You have to decide which combo of legends(characters) will work and it
