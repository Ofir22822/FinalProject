 They ruined Zombies, the most beloved mode in the Call of Duty Series, Blackout is a ripoff of other Battle Royale games. Multiplayer has the worst maps. This game has too many stuff locked behind a paywall.
Guys, this is the BEST GAME EVER! It is violent though. There are limbs flying around if enemies or zombie are blown up by grenades. Also, there is a lot of blood splattering. You can turn off the gore factor though. Also, it contains a lot of bad language. The F word is mentioned a lot of times, the S word is also mentioned a lot of times. As well as crap and asshole. In all it is good for fourteen and up.
Bo4 is overpriced, laggy, glitchy, and I don’t recommend buying it because of the regret that I and plenty of other people have had. People on this game make inappropriate gestures and use plenty of bad language. I also personally don’t suggest buying the game because it also is easy to crash and the gave gets on peoples nerves easily.
