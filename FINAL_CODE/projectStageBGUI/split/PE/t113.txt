 at any given time, making this a difficult game, even compared to other similar titles. bottom line is, this is a great game, that i would fully recommend, but know that if you get into this, your signing yourself up for a challenge.
Following the trend of battle royale, we get Apex Legends, a great game from the Titanfall universe. Great movement mechanics such as sliding and climbing. Lots of fun and bright characters to play as, each with their own abilities and advantages. It's a fun game with friends (if you have any), however there is just not a lot of variety. Age Review: Little bits of blood when shot, characters get knocked giving the ability to"finish them". This consists of a small animation of the player ridiculously killing the opponent. The guns are very unrealistic. There is no language, drugs, or sex. Overall great game for battle royale and Titanfall fans. Recommended for ages 11-12
This is like fortnite but more real and there this less people this game is not good at all. There is nothing to bother if you are a fan of fortnite do not switch. This is very much more graphic but still okay.
I waited a long time to download this and was surprised by how good it was
Nothing
Apex Legends is a popular Battle Royale Game. Sure it's a little rough around the edges but its a great game. But I love this game.
