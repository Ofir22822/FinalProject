 local multiplayer was done wonderfully, and the story is great as well. Definitely a must-buy for anyone who owns a Switch.
I dare to call Super Smash Bros. Ultimate my favourite videogame. It's exceedingly fun, especially when playing with friends, and never gets boring or repetitive. There are countless stages to choose from. I wouldn't even call the fighting "violence" as it isn't gory at all.
Even though it's a fighting game, and the whole point is revolved around violence, there is no actual gore or blood, it's like violence you would see in a kids cartoon where they just jab each other lightly and neither of the characters really get harmed.
I've been a fan of the series since I played the older title, Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Which conissted a decent roster of characters, specifically my favourite being Solid Snaker and Captain Falcon. And eventually playing the other title for the 3DS and Wii U along with the new game for the Switch. But from it's value, it's worth buying and it doesn't present explicit violence. Which is more subtle than Mortal Kombat and similar to Street Fighter or Tekken.
This game is great with family and friend for multiplayer but in the story mode aka world of light one scene is a bit scary and is a little bit hard and frustrating but still a very good game though.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is one of the best switch game ever and you should let your kids play it.
I played the Wii u game and this is not a disappointment. Incredibly fun with artful graphics and deep gameplay.
