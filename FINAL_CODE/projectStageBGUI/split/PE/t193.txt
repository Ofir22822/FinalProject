 mellons it’s ridiculous but unfortunately it is in this world. Overall the game itself is awesome and a good cure for boredom but the only problem is the chat please copy and paste this review to the App Store ratings and reviews for among us so the makers of among us can read this and hopefully make something that gives you the option to turn chats unrelated to the game play off or on. I hope this review helped you decide weather or not to download this game look for my reviews for other stuff :) -Marvel Fan
so among us is about one imposter on the ship or more up to i think 4 there is violence but its just a little blood and bodys with only one bone now onto the social aspects if you kid kows stranger danger and has censor chat on it should be ok just play the game its fun.
