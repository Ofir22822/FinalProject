 in a 13+ rated movie. Includes bad language as well, but nothing bad, just the occasional f*ck or sh*t.
When you see the pic on the cover of Hitman 2 parent's will use 6th sense and say no. BUT if you read this review you will change your mind. First of this is not a military shooter, but more like a stealthy Assasin sort of thing. you don't just use guns, you really expand your creativity to eliminate the target. In the first mission you could go loud and fail the mission, or plant a bomb on the car. Secondly, the game does not encourage violence, but rather make your kill look like an accident, and only kill your target. You also have the choice to knock out people to gain outfits. For curse words, there are some S**t though the game. This game is multiplayer but not on a global scale or anything like that. There are no filters because the only weapon that you use that will reward you with a splash of blood is your pistol.
sure the game swears, but with most games you can turn of the the players dialogue, the gore is mostly just firearms and there is no real graphic scenes. Nudity, you can subdue men and take there close exposing there underwear, but thats about it. THIS HITMAN ISN"T LIKE OTHERS.
