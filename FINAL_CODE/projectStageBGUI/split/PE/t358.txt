 a lot of cutscenes, (those are there to get better experience for the player) Some cutscenes will show people getting their throat cut and getting a spear through the mouth. This will look really bad with blood on but you can always take the option to have blood off mode. There is “sex” in this game but it’s not necessary, you can always skip it The main characters are good role models and this game really show how the world was 2000+ years ago. There is a lot of history is this game and the most of it is based on real historical events and various religonal beliefs. There is strong language in this game (only in the cutscenes) The characters say words such as “f**k, s**t “ they also say a Greek term “Malaka” which I don’t really know what it means This game is also based on what choices you make so you will very often be able to choose if you want to kill the person or not.
its a hard game NO SEX SCENES AT ALL Alot of swearing its not better than origins but what is
Swearing: If you have already played gta or watch dogs they should be ok with the swearing. It uses f*** and s*** a lot but not as bad as gta. Sex: They is talking about it but u don’t see it and the statutes have private parts but you can see it in a class room Blood: It’s a assassin creed game so of course it is bloody but u can turn of blood but u can’t turn of blood for cutscenes. Overall if you play gta or watch dogs 2 already you should be fine.
I love this game sure it can get pretty violent at times and if you enjoy the original assassin's Creed and hiding in bushes stabbing people in the butt then you'll love this game the blood can be turned off and I think it's educational the swearing is minimum but there is a scene where it shows naked Zeus.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is another sequel set in the beautiful open world of Ancient Greek. Filled with tons of stuff to do, such as main quests, side quests, and doing whatever you like in the sandbox world. Sexuality is minor. Artwork is seen with present genitals. Characters can flirt sometimes resulting in implied sex. Gambling and consumerism is present but not required. You are able to purchase DLC'S. Violence is frequent and depends on how the player plays the game. Some parts of the game are fully scripted gameplay, most parts allow the player more freedom to take on objectives however they'd like, including: stealth, aggressive, neutral, mixed. Use of weapons such as swords, blades, lances, spears, daggers, etc result in blood bursts and characters being left stained with blood. Although you are able to switch off blood in the settings. Language is infrequent but strong. Use of "f#!k", "b#!ch", "bastard", "$h!t" and mild language such as "damn"
