 to play but if your not ok for your teen to play this is, its not that bad at all if he/she is mature and + the've probably heard the word S**t before or B***h. There is hardly any nudity or S*x in this game at all and you can choose not to anyways. But in all teens 13 and older can definitly play this game
basically this is the best story in any game that i have heard of in a looooooooooong time. as long as your child is mature enough the game is just fine for any kid age 9+ the swearing is minimal, though a lot of smoking and alchohol. the nudity/sex is EXTREMELY minimal too, with all of it being optional missions or random chane encounters. i played the origanal and this game is much better in my opinion. i cant wait for a RDR3 and once you have played you will be hooked too.
