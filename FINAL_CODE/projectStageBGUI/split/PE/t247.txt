 is the main point of concern but at 13 most kids (in my experience) will be getting used to games like this and start playing more and more of them. The language is similar to what you will find in a playground and there is very little nudity. As long as you know that it is just a game and that it shouldn't be recreated in real life then this game is really ok for most teens.
This is a great game as far as the campaign but read dead online is very hard as anyone can kill you that’s why it’s 14+
it's a cool shooting game. but gta 5 is worse i can tell you
