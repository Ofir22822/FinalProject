 this game, and often goes on sale for much cheaper if you want this game. There is quite a bit of violence in this game, but you have the option to turn off blood. Sexual content is the big issue in this one. Common sense missed quite a lot of stuff in this review. There is an implied scene where the antagonist has sex with another character. Nothing is shown, but it is strongly implied. There is another instance of a villain interacting with a woman in a crude way during the early parts of the main story. This is quite severe, and is often missed by reviews. There are other sexual references throughout the game, with quite strong language in this one. This is honestly one of the worst AC games in terms of content, and is quite bland. I recommend buying AC4 or Unity over this one.
I play this game so much its so good . There is 1 F word in the whole game!!! No sex at all And some blood but can turn off blood anybody 10 and up should definitely play this
It has some swearing and a lot of blood plus drinking.
