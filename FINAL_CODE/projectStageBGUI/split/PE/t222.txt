 the censoring is somewhat obvious to see through, as it just puts asterisks instead of some of the letters in the censored word. For example, "Motherf--ker" would be **********er, so it's truly pretty transparent in most cases. And even so, the chat is as easy to turn off as it is to turn on. There are also some combinations of words that won't get censored. It's imperfect. The same deal is with people's names, they can be quite offensive at times. Overall, the game is fantastic, and I truly recommend it for all ages. Just make sure that your kids know not to meet up with anybody in real life from the game, and they should be fine. The game is free on iPhone, and $4.99 on steam. I sincerely hope this was very helpful.
This is a very fun game! The main point of the game is if your a crewmate, you need to do tasks across the map. if your the imposter, you have to sabotage, and kill all the crewmates. There is a good amount of violence, if you are imposter, you slice off a crewmates head, it is not bloody or gory. If you get killed, you see the imposter kill you in a bloody way. The graphics are in 2-D so it is not realistic. The online chat can be bad sometimes, there are people swearing, or saying terrible things to one another. Just watch out if that happens. All in all this is a fantastic murder mystery game!
Too easy. Not fun at all, being a crewmate or impostor sucks. The graphics are terrible. I guess a 5 year old could find it fun. But it's just so, so easy. If you play it it's like saying your deductive reasoning abilities are horrible.
