 strong violence/gore and i dont think anything else is that bad and FYI they ask you when you start if you want to cencor the swearing and gore if you turn that off then i say 10+ but if your kid goes to school they will hear 10X worse language in school and its not very frequent but does include f**k and s**t and there is a kind of Champaign but not really and you can skip it thats where most of the swearing is and in multiplayer if you puck the specialist "ruin" sometimes he will say "its about f***in time" but seriously if your kid wants this game just buy it. Its not a harmful game in the slightest. I have been playing since the OG black ops the past games had alot more graphic things in them but i highly reccomend this fun action shooter that is great for friends to get online and play together. Untill next time, bye
I would SO buy this game for my kids. They loved it and said I was the best mom ever. I even like the game and I don't play video games.
