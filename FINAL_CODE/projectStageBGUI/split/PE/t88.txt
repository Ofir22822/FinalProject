 absence from the main devil may cry series, Capcom brings Devil May Cry 5!, The legendary devil hunter Dante makes a return along with the young devil hunter Nero, and a mysterious character by the name of "V" is introduced. Devil May Cry is renown for its challenge, but it is all the more satisfying when you pass a battle! The game does contain some revealing scenes, but are mostly concealed, and some scenes that contain citizens in severe pain, Nero also has an attitude of an older teen, with lines such as "time to kick some ass". The game sees Dante, Nero and V team up to defeat the demon king Urizen to stop the tree attacking Redgrave city, and prevent Urizen reaching a fruit containing insane power, and the story of Dante's mothers death continues... And a return of one more character awaits you. NOT FOR CHILDREN OR YOUNGER TEENS. PEGI 18, M (MATURE) MY RECCOMENDATION: 16+
