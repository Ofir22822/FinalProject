Action anime game does not disappoint
I think they should change some of it
Great messages: Be yourself, be loyal, friendships are important, be brave in times of trouble, don't kill the bad guys if you can help it, be appropriate Great role models: The characters are all very different, all with touching backstories. While everyone has some sort of flaw, they still try their best to work past their differences to save their world. Ease of play: Gameplay is rather challenging, but once you find a good method, it's not particularly difficult. The plot is very involved, but because the game is only partially voiced, there is a lot of reading involved. Violence: A couple characters do die, though no deaths are explicit. When enemies are defeated, they disappear in a flash of light. The protagonists are very careful not to kill the villains, although they may have to point a gun at them to make sure they behave. There is no gore, and blood looks like spilled soda - a bit unrealistic. Some characters have very violent backgrounds, and violent images in black and white are shown sometimes when a character is speaking of their background. However, when speaking of their past, almost all the characters explain that without that hardship, they would not be the person they were that day. Characters use swords, magical staffs, lances, guns, bows, and they control giant robots. Sex: There are a few innuendos, and two main characters have a bit of a rough start because they find themselves in an awkward position. One female character does tend to flirt with the other female characters, but she is a minor character, and the other characters never respond to her words in a positive way. Female breast size is mentioned, but it is not an ongoing subject. The girls' school uniforms have slightly shorter skirts, but nothing can be seen. Swearing: Characters do use the word d**n when something does go terribly wrong, and a character was called a "pompous a**" twice. One villain uses s**t toward the end of the game. D**n is spread a bit throughout the game, but considering the game has approximately 120 parts in it that each take more than three hours to complete, it is infrequent. Like real people, some characters swear more than others, while some never swear in the entire game. For example, characters with kind dispositions tend to swear less than snarky characters or villains. Consumerism: there are many references to characters and events from past games, Trails in the Sky (they talk about Cassius Bright and the Bracer Guild) and Trails of Zero (they talk about the Special Support Section during the annexation of Crossbell). Drinking/drugs/smoking: There are references
