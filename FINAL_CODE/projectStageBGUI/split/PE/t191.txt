 the game itself but the chat players can chat with you even if you don’t know them and some people will try to make the room private and have Inappropriate chats about sex (for example sometimes people can ask you to send nudes or to sleep with them) they can also have inappropriate names for themselves (for example: Horny Girl/Boy, Sexy Girl/Boy, Need a BF/GF (BF= Boyfriend, GF= Girlfriend) and Sex Chat) if you see these names it’s best not to enter those rooms if someone asks the questions above then either leave the room or kick or ban them from your room. Privacy concerns 7/10: This is also not the game but the chat sometimes immature adults and teens will ask for personal information (I have had people ask me for my Full name, age, If I’m a girl or a boy, where I live, my Snapchat Instagram discord and hangouts ID, My mobile phone number, if I have WhatsApp or Facebook, If I have TikTok and if so what is my ID and my family and friends names and numbers) and pretty much every time I enter a room they ask me for my Instagram and Snapchat ID I have never answered any of these questions I have simply left or banned that person it is very important that if you get this game NEVER USE YOUR REAL NAME AS YOUR USERNAME (for example my username for Among us is Marvel Fan and I never tell them my real name if the ask for my name I always say Marvel Fan I usually get banned for that but it’s better to be banned than a stranger knowing all your personal information.

Drinking drugs and smoking 2/10: not the game the chat sometimes the players can make references to drinking drugs and smoking I have never seen this happen but I know people who have. Great messages and role models 4/10: if your a crew mate the aim is to vote out the imposter but you dont know who the imposter is so you and the other crew mates need to use teamwork to figure it out. Language 7/10: not the game the chat although it does filter out the swear words you end up with a chat full of ********* those and teens and young adults who play this can easily get around this by removing a letter but everyone still knows what they are saying (I have seen F*ck become Fck, Sh*t become sht, and b*tch become btch, sometimes even private parts of the body are said P*nis becomes banana, and v**ina becomes hole and breasts become
