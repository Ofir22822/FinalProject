 different tactics trying to capture the objectives and getting new weapons. For money and price, the zombie mode isn't worth buying its really just stupid and not fun also you cant turn off the blood in zombie mode but they look really ugly.
If your kids are not scared of gore or anything then this is perfect but if they are you can turn off all the gory parts.
This game is really fun, but parents should know that your legs will blow up on a daily basis, and there is excessive blood. If parents don't want their kids playing shooters, then this is not the game for them. However, as an eight year old, I still think older kids would enjoy it. To be honest, the first time I saw the legs blowing up, I got pretty scared. Overall, it's an awesome game!
My son plays this game and I have been watching him play it for the past few days. Yes it has gore but it’s not like other games like left for dead 2 where it’s everywhere. He plays with friends and overall I think is a good game for kids over 13.
