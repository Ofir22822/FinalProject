 you not want to give up. Warning the game is not easy
This game is fantastic and kept me busy for hours! The first important thing to say is this game can be very hard, especially new players or young players. In terms of violence it is very fantasy based but there is sometimes blood when you hit the monsters with your weapons. There is no swearing as far as I'm aware. Overall I would recommend this game to any teen-adult that owns a Switch! 10/10
hehe time to destroy!
Cute Little Puzzle Game!
Nice game to chill out with
this game is fun and absolutely incredible yes sir play a round its fun there's nothing bad about it its a game about being a hole and destroy everything its great play it!
I LOVE donut county in it's entirety. It requires a mind that thinks outside the box (which is why I think it is for children 9 and up), and requires you to be able to manipulate the mechanics of the game, and I appreciate Ben Esposito for that. I didn't really pay attention to the story, but there were some parts where I just wanted to see what happened next. Most of the cutscenes are in a single setting (referred to as 'Nine Hundred Ninety Nine Feet Below'), but at the end (minor spoilers) you return to the surface to mess around with interactable credits. Overall, the game is a yes.
Donut County is a really simple easy game. Your goal is to try to make your sinkhole bigger and swallow larger things. The story is quite entertaining and I kind of wish it was longer.
