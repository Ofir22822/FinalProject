 and the same is true on steam. for a buggy, overpriced version of streetfighter or tekken you could get fallout 4goty edition or titanfall 2 and still have some money left over In short dont buy i think it could be a fun party game but as it costs 45 this game never will be worth it, its lobby is buggy among other problems plus the £25 DLC, 25 for just 8 new characters In short this game is a piece of crap scam
I think it is okay for kids my age to play this game but little violence
