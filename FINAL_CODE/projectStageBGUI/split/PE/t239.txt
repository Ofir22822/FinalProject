 the actual show not being rated
I actually really like the game. It is a great game to play with friends. But if u don’t have any, that’s okay to because it is also fun to play alone. I do have on issue with it tho. And that is the fact that there are so many characters and SERO HANTA is not one of them. Otherwise it would be the perfect game.
I am posting my review of the My Hero Academia anime here, because this is the closest thing to the anime on this site. Anyway, I love My Hero Academia. Parents need to know that the show has a lot of superhero action, some "Traditional" anime scenes(Why do you always have to ruin everything, Mineta?!) and language. However, this show also has great characters, voice acting, animation and action.
Its a bit hard to understand if you dont read the books, and not even that fun. Meh.
really fun, some cussing
The anime and manga are way more inappropriate than the game. The anime and manga contain cleavage being blocked by only smoke, some language (bas***d, s**t, what the h**l, d**n) not too bad, and too very perverted students. The game has very little of the two being perverts, not a lot of language,and a slightly revealing outfit. I think 10+ Is ok if you're not too overprotective and definitely if the anime or manga has been consumed before. Also this game is basically Street fighter so it's based around violence. Plus, the violence is also even more ok because, calm down people it's anime. People are saying good role models are non-existent in this universe. COUGH COUGH deku COUGH COUGH todoroki COUGH COUGH shall I continue?
Now what you need to know about this game is that it’s based on an anime, so if you haven’t watched that, don’t even think about buying it. The game obviously is a fighting game so if you’re afraid of your child picking up something from physical contact, be warned. But even though the point of the game is to hurt each other, it is more comical than most games and has no blood at all. There is one “PLUS ULRA” move that is done by the Hero Killer Stain, that simulates sort of blood-ish affects splattering on the screen, but it’s not red or realistic, and you can’t actually see the cut/stab or hear gory sound effects. (Besides, if you have watched the show, it’s kinda his thing) There is minimal, low-grade cursing like “Damn” or “Hell” but that’s not very often. It’s not super easy to control, but at least it’s not Dark Souls. You have to combo, but you do that by clicking a button in rapid succession (not super fast.) The “PLUS ULTRA” moves are kinda hard to maneuver, seeing as you have to hold down both triggers while pressing Y/X/Square or A/B/Circle. Gameplay-wise, it will keep you entertained for about 10-20 hours, unless you want some Online/Mission action. Missions should keep you
