 aside, the main problem is the voice chat. As with almost any game, the voice chat has some of the worst people on the planet. You're gonna be cursed at, called terrible, insulted, anything goes. Luckily, theres a feature that allows you to mute your teammates as soon as you get in game, so make sure you do that. Luckily, this game has a great "ping system", a way of communication that has no talking or chat. See an enemy? "Enemy over there" ping. See some good loot that you want? "I'm looting over there" ping. It's highly intuitive so the voice chat is really not necessary. Overall, I praise this game highly, you should definitely try it.
the only thing parents need to look at is the revive graphics.
It is a very good game and supports teamwork. You have to stick with your team or you and your team is in a big disadvantage. This will help kids develop teamwork in the real world because they are doing teamwork with strangers. This will build confidence. Very fast 1 person shooter. Barely any blood.
the game is somehow enjoyable.Not to forget the game is like a mix of pubg and overwatch
Why even bother to play FOOORTNITEE (the crap game) when you can play this!
