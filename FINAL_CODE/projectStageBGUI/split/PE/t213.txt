 as of OCT 2020, there's a hacker by Eiris Louis who will hack you if you do what he says so just leave if you see a spammed message in the chat. That also brings me to my next statement if you do not press the censor chat button in the options youre gonna see some very naughty things but this is a very good game totally recommend and it's free on phone not on computer steam though. Quick edit the Game is working on an anti cheat so we don't have to see hackers as much.
This game is the perfect mix of puzzles and fun my whole school plays this game and i can guarantee they would all say the same thing.
It’s a great game to play with friends. Although there are some swearers in chat sometimes but there is an option to sensor swears. There is a bit violence but nothing to serious. A little blood but draw a few drops of red and there you have it.
Among Us is a game where one character is the impostor, and the rest are crewmates who try to fix the ship and do tasks and stuff. Watch out because there can be a lot of language in the game due to the chat. However there is a setting where you can ban rude words, so your children don't see them. Violence includes when you are the impostor and you kill, because as you kill, a slight squirt of blood comes out of the body of the character you're killing. There are different ways to kill characters: they can get shot, (no blood) stabbed (no blood) and basically that's it. This game is perfect for kids 10+
I think you should let all kids or Grown ups play this game because it is very kid and grown up friendly!
Among us is a great game about deduction, lying, and strategy. The game is a good brain workout and can increase your social skills! The game does have a bit of violence though, (I mean It IS a murder mystery after all)! There are kill animations that feature guns, knifes, etc. However it's all cartoons and there is none/little blood or gore. Bad words in the chat are also censored.
