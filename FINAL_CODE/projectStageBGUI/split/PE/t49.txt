this game is not for kids and for me because it makes kids to vomiit
So I am 14 and I have grown up playing the Mortal Kombat games since I was very little. My parents are not even slightly strict when it comes to what games I can and cant play. They let me play whatever I want but its because I know to never reenact what I see and hear in them. I think that as long as your child is mature, they should be able to handle this game by the time they are 13 or 14 but I think the average kid should wait till they are at least 16 to play this. The game is VERY gory with tons of blood, guts, dismemberment, broken bones, and popped testicles but a fair share of the violence is made comical like Johny cage using a ripped in half body as a ventriloquist dummy. The blood is also not as realistic looking as it was in Mortal Kombat X. In Mortal Kombat 11, the blood is rather bright red instead of the more realistic dark blood that was in X. With that being said, there is still a lot of very disturbing and unfunny fatalities and crushing blows that made me kind of wince like when Geras slowly rips all of the skin off of his victim during a fatality and when Cassie Cage punches her Male victim in the testicles and it shows them popping. If you have played a Mortal Kombat game before, you should know what to expect in this game. Unlike Mortal Kombat 9, the female characters are not overly sexualized. None of the female costumes are too revealing which is good. There are also a fair share of good role models in the story mode of Mortal Kombat 11 like Liu Kang (my favorite character) and Raiden. Lastly, the game is rather complicated just like the previous games. While not as combo-reliant as MKX, there are still combos that would probably be very hard for younger kids and beginners to pull off so I wouldn't get this game for your kid if they haven't had experience with other fighting games. TL;DR very gory and hard to get the hang of but has good role models and female characters are not overly sexualized like in MK9. If your kid is mature, they should
